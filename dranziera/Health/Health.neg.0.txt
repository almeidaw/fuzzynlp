 sizes are much smaller than what is recomended in the chart . I tried to put it and sheer it ! . I guess you should not buy this item in the internet . . it is better to go to the store and check it
 This model may be ok for sedentary types , but I 'm active and get around alot in my job - consistently found these stockings rolled up down by my ankles ! Not Good !! Solution
 Unless they sent me the wrong product by mistake , the foot cushion picture and description does not match the item delivered . I was under the impression I would receive two -LRB- a pair -RRB- of water filled foot cushions that I could insert into my shoes . Instead I received ONE foot cushion , filled with another material -LRB- not water -RRB- that you attach to your foot via a toe strap . I was definately not happy with the item and sent it back for a refund . Luckily for me Amazon has a great return policy ... they make returns very easy !
 This product smells when you open the package and it appears one of the gel cushions leaks so I spent $ 10 and havent worn then . I wouldnt buy this product again . Dont waste your money on something you may not be able to use .
 this is not waterproof.its GARBAGE where batteries go in broke , while trying to adj.DO NOT BUY.you turn the end to control it , that loosens the battery cover where water gets in so how is it waterproff ?????
 It is very small compared to what i thought it would be , but even so it did n't work when we got it
 I got this throat spray in a hurry hoping to relieve my 3.5 yo daughter from a bad sore throat . It tastes awful , and it 's just not meant for a young child . I got it after a recommendation from another mom , and it was a bad decision . I 'll keep it to numb a scratched-up knee or elbow .
 Noisy , crude five point vibration pad.NOT ! a massager , a vibration pad!We purchased three of these and we sent back three of these!Worthless , no , worse than worthless !

 I do n't understand why these inserts are made up from 2 pieces . It should just be one piece . The 2 pieces are held together with a small piece of double sided tape and COMPLETELY fall apart after 1 day of walking . No problem with seller , this is just a HORRIBLY made product .
 The band was far too thin and would roll down my leg continuously . I returned all pairs I bought for a refund . Very disappointing for a Jobst product .

 This is n't really a massager , it does n't vibrate or sooth muscles . It is really more of a flashlight with a dinky infrared bulb in it that is n't powerful enough to do any good anyways . Save your money , folks . This one is a complete dud .
 I used this product a couple of times and was not really impressed . To get good results I guess you would have to use it in a specific area for a good length of time , otherwise not much good .
 Amazon responded immediately but forwarded to the supplier . Do n't waste your money . It 's a hand held wand that may or may not be infrared . Does n't heat up to any degree that will be helpful . Still waiting to hear back from the supplier -LRB- two weeks now -RRB- to return this item . Know someone who has the EXACT same item and paid $ 10 ... . Enough said
 I had another infrared massager before this one that I used for years to help with sore muscles and a nasty TMJ condition . It finally shorted out and I bought this product just a few weeks ago . I had one of the worst headaches of my entire life yesterday and was using this on my jaw when I most unfortunately fell asleep . I guess muscle relaxers and vicodin will do that to you . Anyway , when I woke up , I found that I had rolled over and the infrared massager was underneath my pillow . It completely melted and burned through my sheets and a couple inches into my mattress . I had fallen asleep a few times with my other infrared massager with no consequences so this surprised and dismayed me . This is not a safe product - it either needs to be made of sturdier material than cheap plastic or have a timer on it - I would certainly be willing to pay the extra money to not have to worry about setting fire to my house or burning myself . Sorry - ca n't recommend it .

 I was not even able to use this item because it tore upon putting it together . DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM !
 Maybe my husband is bigger than normal but we had the hardest time getting this on . Once it was on we wanted it off pretty quick . The vibrations were n't very strong and one of the vibes was stuck in the on position so we had to remove batteries to turn it off . I did n't get any benefit from it and I do n't think he got much .
 First of all you have to already have a pretty stiff erection to get this thing on . Secondly , we 've used it twice and the third time we went to use it one of the dolphin heads split apart from the main ring . We 've washed it both times we used it with toy cleaner - nothing harsh . It 's cheaply made and the batteries do not last at all . Once it was on it really did n't do what it is supposed to do - it 's more awkward than anything . Definitely would not recommend .

 I read a previous review that said hers got a run the first time she used them and I figured I 'd just be more careful ... mine got a run the second time I used them ! Unless you 're desperate , do n't bother . I expected better quality for the price I paid !
 I tried these Jobst 15-20 mmHg pantyhose in my search for high quality therapeutic support pantyhose for a severe circulation problem in one of my legs . I did find them a little difficult to put on , but once they were on they stayed in place nicely and provided great support.The only problem I had was , like the other review stated ... they ran the second time I wore them . For as expensive as these pantyhose are , they should last longer than 2 wearings.They are not too sheer , if that is something you are looking for in support hose . They look more like tights when they are on your legs . I did find the beige shade to be a little more like a pale nude shade .
 I have worn Jobst compression hose for a few years now . I havenever had a problem . I was thrilled when I had the option fora sheer pair ... great for summer . The third time I wore one pair , I got a hole in them . I am not even sure how that happened . I figuredI must have done something . I put on my backup pair and the first timeI wore them I developed a hole in them ... the same leg -LRB- right one -RRB- . Nowthat I see these posts I know I will never purchase them again .
 I put them on at the doctor 's office and the first time I had to take them off , sure enough , ran them . Otherwise , liked them very much .
 Having read the previous reviewers ' reports warning about how easily this product could develop runs , I was super careful and tried very much to make my expensive pair last . The first time I had this pantyhose on , I got a bad run that ruined this very expensive pair of hosiery ! Unbelievable !
 This looked like it would be lots of fun but it 's very hard and uncomfortable and doesnt vibrate very well at all . Dont waste your money
 First of all , the wire came out as i was untangling the cord , so it is very fragile . It is too tall . It 's ears are too high above my girl 's clit for her too feel anything . It 's not the greatest thing in the world , and i do not recommend that you buy it . huge disappointment .
 This product looked fun but in reality was very uncomfortable and it vibes only at the middle ! It 's also very large -LRB- long -RRB- and did n't fit very well ! Anyway , in summary , a neat idea , but not a staple or even fun for a one time use !
 These bra inserts are very stiff and tend toslip out of place on your shoulder -- they arerather heavy/bulky and more uncomfortable thanhaving a bra strap dig into you ! I have sincefound lightweight ones that stay in place allday and were $ 1.99 a pair -- -LRB- commonlyfound in the lingerie sections of most dept.stores -RRB- .
 I ordered and paid for an 8 ounce product and received a 4 ounce product . Now the seller wants me to take a picture of the product and the bar code and send it to them before they will make good on it . I 've ordered from them before and there have been issues . Never again ... What a pain .

 The Squiggler fell apart at second use , with no way to put the prongs back into the base . This is a worthless piece of junk ! Do not waste your time on this sub-standard , horribly designed and made product !!!!!

 I guess these would be good if you had foot surgery and wanted to place something lose and protective over bandaging , but not for under a boot cast . I was under the impression these would be tall enough to almost reach my knee . They only go about 4 '' above the ankle . Very wimpy , probably would n't hold up to too many washes .

 I purchased this thermometer because we wanted an accurate thermometer and were tired of the generic drug store thermometers . We definitely need to be provided an accurate on spot temp due to my daughters health issues . I was super excited to receive this thermometer right away !!! Shipping was GREAT ! I opened it , read the manual and then took her temp -LRB- knowing she was hot -RRB- it said 98.8 . I pulled out our old thermometer and it registered 100.4 , THIS IS AN ISSUE ! I thought maybe it was just this one time and tried it again later that evening , knowing she was still running a fever . It read 99.9 , old thermometer read 100.9 . YET AGAIN AN ISSUE !!! I continued to try both thermometers the next day while she still had a temp and STILL had the same large variation in temps . My husband decided to call the company . No answer , no answering service . He called WelchAllyn since we had no response from the Medical Supply Company . They asked if we purchased this thermometer in June ? He said ummm no we just bought it 5 days ago . The associate said well this thermometer is registered as being purchased in June and we are n't sure if this Medical Supply company is a registered seller of these WelchAllyn thermometers . They are having a supervisor call us tomorrow . We called the Medical supply company yet again and finally had someone answer , unfortunately they seem like they could care less about the fact that it is not working and they definitely do not care that this could have been previously owned and returned . They told us there is a 15 % restocking fee for returning it unless WelchAllyn says it was previously owned . WHAT !!! So they do n't know if they are selling items that are previously owned and obviously faulty ? The associate at WelchAllyn said this may have been returned due to being faulty and now is being sold as `` New '' through this company . THIS IS RIDICULOUS CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SALES SERVICE !!!! These thermometers may be PREVIOUSLY OWNED AND USED AND BEING SOLD AS `` NEW '' !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will update this as soon as a I speak with a supervisor tomorrow !

 A friend suggested this herb to me to help with my awful PMS . After taking Vitex for only three days during PMS , I began to feel horrible
 I have been taking two capsules daily for two months and not felt or seen one difference in my health . This has n't been the miracle pill to help cure my PCOS or help my ovulate . In fact , I had a period before I started this pill and not one since .
 this made me really dizzy so I had to stop using it after only one use . I ended up tossing it out .
 I found research that said this possibly may help get your cycles back and so after finishing the bottle the cycle never came . I guess if you keep it up after a few months is what might help , but I decided instead of buying more and hoping it would help to talk to my doctor first .
 I noticed I was very tired and headachy after taking Vitex , but I read that is a common side effect and that it was temporary . After the first week , I only noticed the tiredness increasing . I would feel almost confused at times and just plain strange . When taking it during the day , one time , I completely drove past the shopping center I was going to . I 'd go through these spells where I felt very heady , like I was going to pass out . I was only taking 250mg per day . I had high hopes for this as a treatment for PCOS , but I could n't continue with it . This does n't seem like a common result , but malaise and confusion are listed among vitex 's side effects . Maybe I should have tried vitex fruit which is less potent than vitex extract , but this is something I 'm not messing around with any more ! Back to progesterone cream !

 Since I have ordered for this product and inspite of the company debiting the total amount for the product from my account , I have not recieved the product till date . The company promises to deliver the product in 12 hrs but its approx more than 3 weeks since the amount was debited but till now , the product hasnt reached me . The company doesnt respond to email queries and its toll free number -LRB- the only other point of contact mentioned from their end other than email address -RRB- always sounds busy and goes to voicemail .
 This item broke after a very short time of use . It is not truly waterproof as it stopped working after its first try in the bathtub/shower . The next day it was dead , and water kept leaking from it . So now it 's dead.It is very big , way too big to be really comfortable and it is hard to insert . It is not flexible or pliable , so it is not adjustable to people 's bodies or preferences ! The bullet function actually burns , so it is not pleasant . Also when it is first opened a very very very strong rubber smell comes out , and it definitely does not go away.It 's not high quality , it broke very fast .
 After repeated washings , it still smelled like a toxic plastic and who wants to put toxic plastic inside their body . Also , it did n't do the job . So I wasted my money and had to throw it away .
 The reviews were right about it being VERY large in girth . It was a bit uncomfortable , and I did n't love the bumps on the back -LRB- that you ca n't see in the picture or in the description -RRB- , and the `` head '' of it has quite an edge.When you take it out of the package , it has an overwhelming smell of plastic , so it probably contains those carcinogens that everyone is talking about.The exterior piece is VERY powerful and would be great if it was on another toy . The tickler is also fairly rigid and difficult to place exactly.I would n't recommend it because I think you can do better . And I also think it 's worth it to spend more money on a toy without phthaylenes -LRB- or however you spell it -RRB- .
 This product is NOT intended for a beginner ... i had many toys and this one by far caught me by suprise on how big it is . The shaft is too big and makes it uncomfortable unless used with the right lubrication . Being a smaller/petite woman , it was a little uncomfortable for me b/c of the size ... but other than that , it was very pleasurable .
 I find it hard to believe there are women really using this product ... turns out it 's about the same diameter as the cardboard tube inside paper-towels . Seriously ??? ~ ~ ~
 Hello everybody ! I ordered this product but the first one that i received did n't work , and now i have the second one and it still does n't work . It might sound weird , but i put batteries in it and it does n't start working . What should i do ? Thanks !
 It 's not water proof and it rusts on the inside . The turning head is a nice feature , but I do n't think I really needed it .
 Not what I thought I was getting . I do n't think jell is as enjoyable as the silicone and unfortunately I had to pay to find out .
 WASTE OF MONEY . FIRST TIME BUYING SUCH AND IT NEVER WORKED . MOTOR NEVER TURNED WHEN BATTERY WAS PUT IN . SUCH BLATANT ROBBERY !
 First off I am currently deployed and my wifes fisrt viberator that we bought , to help with the lonely nights , was supposed to be waterproof got some water damage and no longer works . She asked me to order her another so I looked around and found this one , it had many decent reviews so I decided to order it . When it arrived and my wife opened the package only to find that the item I ordered had a much larger cirmcurference , the one she had before was about 5 inches or so . She decided to try to use it because of the fact that there is not a return policy . When she attempted to use the item it did not work , she tried replacing the batteries and that only made the rabbit portion come on . It would be extremely helpful if there were some sizes and lengths to determine what exactly you were buying . So all in all I am extremely disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone .
 This thing smells SO gross , like harsh , toxic chemicals , that I ca n't even use it ! I 've washed it in HOT , super soapy water , cleaned it with alcohol , and even let it `` air out , '' all to no avail . I tried using it and the smell was seriously distracting . I took it out of my drawer , after all the washing , to show it to my boyfriend and while i was still a good four feet away he said , `` Ewww , what 's that smell . '' I found it to be WAY too large , too , and I 've had kids . Sadly , this will be going in the garbage .
 I thought this would be good to try because I love the floating beads in the other rabbit vibes . I am a single gal , solo practitioner so to speak , and found that the steel rotating balls are just not comfortable for me . They are too hard with no give and get quickly uncomfortable especially if you squeeze your muscles . I can usually have one orgasm with this toy but not the multiple orgasms with the more comfortable rabbit vibes with the pearl beads . It 's okay but it just does n't get the job done for me .
 i bought this for my wife to replace her rabbit habbit that broke after a few uses . let me first say that it say 1 1/2 inches no it makes the rabit habit look tiny . its hugeat least 1 3/4 inch around . but its much slower than the other dosent vibrate near as fast . other than the size being more real size she liked the rabit habit better but we just got this one maybe it will get better . just goes to show bigger isnt better always . needs more power
 I 've had a few rabbit-type toys over the years and really love them overall . Thank goodness this was not the first one I ever got or I might not have tried again.What attracted me was that it is waterproof which has been an occasional lifesaver for shower time . I would normally not want the controls on the base though so I really do n't want to even look at this option if I 'm anywhere dry . I find it awkward to have to reach like that when adjustment is needed on intensity/speed . I also notice that the weight of the batteries at the base of the device requires more attention from me to keep the fun where it needs to be . In my other rabbits , having the control and battery pack as a separated portion allows me to easily and naturally deal with any sudden need to change the action in a comfortable position . It also makes the business end easier to handle , prop , maneuver , etc since it does n't have all the extra baggage and weight at the base.The girth is a bit gluttonous for my tastes but it 's not unmanageable . The beads inside look and sound a bit too scary and have not actually felt worthwhile to me . The ability to change direction has no appeal for me either but perhaps if someone is using the tip of the shaft for some foreplay this could be useful . I do n't find it to be soft enough or set for a proper path to make that interesting with this device though . Other rabbits of more modest size have definitely delivered larger return though.The ears are too stiff and sometimes can hurt if not careful . ... and really , how careful can you remain when you are trying to let go and `` enjoy ? '' For me , perhaps it 's a YMMV thing , the ears also do n't naturally land where they should when the other business aspect is where it needs to be . This requires some odd posturing and holding but it can be done to the desired end result . I have to emphasize that even when that result is achieved , my other rabbits give a higher quality reward and often in less time unless I purposely played it to last longer.Out of the package , the smell was really strong and surprised me since I had never noticed this in others I 've gotten . It did not fade quickly in spite of repeated washing and even now it still smells `` industrial . `` I would not buy this model again so hopefully I 'll find a better waterproof rabbit option next time .
 First of all , no matter how much I washed it , it still smelled HORRIBLE ! The `` rabbit ears '' are too long . The part it is supposed to hit is n't that high up . The worst part of all ... the head of the shaft does n't turn . It barely moves , so how am I supposed to feel anything ? It is loud , and has a machine sound because of the `` floating beads '' which do absolutely nothing . Look into something else ... this Rabbit is a piece of junk . I looked at a lot of reviews to make sure I got the right one , and I was mistaken . I do n't know how other people gave this more than 2 stars.The vibrate is descent , though .
 This product would not even turn on once batteries were installed ! It also has a terrible chemical odor which would probably cause most health conscious people not to risk actually using it anyway!Please be aware you can not return so order at your own risk !
 When I ordered this item , I was not aware that it could not be returned if defective . The item arrived very timely , but it would not operate . I later found out that the product is nonreturnable . I was very dissatisfied with this purchase .
 I received this item and it ; s dead!Doesn ' t work and I can not return it . wasted $ 40 bucks . . I 'm so angry , I bought this as a gag gift for my friend for a party and now i 'm out money ... Very disappointing ...
 Put new batteries in - product wont turn on at all - very disappointed !!! Save your money - many others are better - should have read the other reviews and then i would have been warned
 I was so excited to try this item when I ordered it , but when I got it I was so disappointed because it did n't work . It did n't even turn on ! I did n't try to return it because I was under the impression it is a nonreturnable item . I wo n't order this product again but will try ordering from Amazon again .
 Had a very toxic smell and probably will be toxic if used . No matter how much it was cleaned it still had a very strong smell . Scared to use it because of its smell . The ears and shaft are very hard and not flexible at all . It will be tossed in the trash . Another waste of money .
 I did not like this one . It is a bit large and it has a plastic , rubbery smell that never goes away . It 's also slightly loud . I have had similar toys before and I like this one the least .
 Out of the box it did n't even work . Whats worse there is n't an easy way to return it . I 'm having to email amazon and hope for an exchange within a week . ?
 Got this product and used it but it does n't get me to the big O. It 's just to stiff for me and also the rabbit ears do n't reach the right place . All i have to say it 's just was n't for me . I wish i did n't buy it .
 First time buying a toy of this type . Great orgazm but then the buttons stopped working and the devise would not increase in speed or intensity and nor wood it shut off . No wat to return it on Amazon due to policy
 The vibrator worked well for six months or so we had it , but over that time the silicone became discolored -LRB- turned a yellowish color -RRB- inside where the circular beads rotate and it just spread from there towards the base . The entire vibrator turned a yellow tint from where the beads are down to the base . It was one of our favorite toys for a while , until we discovered how cheaply built it was . The battery holder was the problem . It is cheaply made , so the thin contacts in the battery compartment which slides into the device are the most likely thing to break , which we soon discovered . What I learned from this was , you have to put your money where your mouth is when it comes to getting a quality sex toy . If you go cheap , you can go home . Forget this one . It is not a good investment and it will just break on you . In the short term , a couple of months , it will last , but do n't expect it to work much longer than that . We did n't even use it that often and it still broke down . Also , it was only $ 25 when we bought it , now they have gone up on the price . Forget it - NOT worth your money people ! If you want a quality product , try the Lelo vibrators out . Lelo 's products have a lifetime warranty and you never have to buy batteries because they are rechargeable .
 I BOUGHT THIS ITEM AS A GIFT . I PUT BATTERIES IN IT AND IT WORKED FOR THREE MINS AND QUIT . I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET IT TO WORK AGAIN AND ACCORDING TO AMAZON POLICY I CA N'T RETURN IT ! DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY !
 Other reviews state this item is very quiet . Mine makes a very loud grinding noise . If the windows were open , I think the neighbors would hear it . The noise is totally distracting , thus I can not use this product . If it was quiet as stated by others , I think I might be very satisfied with it . Did I get a `` lemon ? ''
 I ordered this after my other rabbit quit working . Thought this one was affordable . Very Very cheaply made and not much power . Smells very bad , so much you could hardly stand to be in the same room as it , let alone use it . If you are going to buy a rabbit do not buy this one . Invest in one a little nicer .
 I just got this today and have been playing with it for a couple of hours and have n't gotten a decent orgasm . This is my first vibrator/toy ever and I do n't think I will be buying any more . Maybe its just me but vibrations do little to nothing for me and the fact that this toys rabbit ears are way too long does n't help . After playing with it for awhile and just being left frustrated I managed to get a weak orgasm not worth anywhere near the 30 dollars i paid for this ! The vibe itself is way too thick and it has a awful chemical smell . I should saved my money ! I will continue to try and play around with it but I am not hopeful . The rotating shaft also does NOTHING for me . .
 It is NOT NOT NOT WATERPROOF ! Loved it , till we tried it in the tub . Worked for 4 seconds , then stopped . VERY DISAPPOINTED ...
 This smells like paint thinner or something . It does NOT go away with washing or airing or anything else , and is so strong my entire ROOM smells like a chemical factory . Aside from the fact that it is a total buzz-kill to have this awful stink , I have no idea if it is save . Who knows what 's in/on this thing and I certainly would n't want to put it in my body ... it could be leaching chemicals . Cancer comes to mind . I had to throw it away . Total waste . Do n't buy it , find another supplier !
 I used it once and have not touched it since , the dolfin wont stay on my clit and the clear stuuf is too soft , Waste of MONEY
 I was really looking forward to using this item . However , upon opening it I was overcome with a strong chemical odor . The packaging says &#34; for novelty only &#34; which means , it 's not safe . I did some research and found out this could actually cause cancer . Of course , I ca n't even return the stupid thing eventhough I never used it . Shame on you people for selling shoddy products that can esentially kill people .
 Purchased online , good description with size included . However , when it arrived it was larger than advertised -LRB- length and circumference -RRB- . It was actually to large and caused some discomfort . It has a very hard plasltic like feeling which did not help with insertion . It seems to be well built if you are looking for the terminator of vibrators !! If you have had a few kids and need something bigger and harded , this is for you ! For us it was a waste of the money spent as we will not be using it again .
 Received as a gift from my wishlist , I added it because of all the positive reviews and because it was waterproof -LRB- also the clear design looked cool -RRB- , but quite honestly this is weaker than my cheapy $ 8 vibrator from a local shop . I have not tried it in water so I ca n't comment on that . It is also too stiff -LRB- rather than being too big -RRB- , but mostly my issue is the very weak vibration , especially lacking in the area that should be stimulated most . The rotation also did nothing for me . With a name like Jackrabbit , I was expecting a lot more oomph . Do n't bother with this product if your preference is not gentle ... I found it annoying .
 It is too thick for me and the material is very hard too uncomfortable I would not recommend it because it did not explained how the product really was and even though is brand new in the box never been used you can not return the product . So I just wasted my money ...
 This product worked for 4-5 times the the rotation stopped working . Batteries run out or lose power after 3-4 uses . I would read reviews before buying another one ... I am looking into the Hitachi wand massager now and I believe I will buy it since is a power operated toy and will never run out of power.Not impressed with this product .
 I tried this product . It broke during my first use . Then I contacted the seller and they told me to give good feedback and said they 'd send a new one . It 's been a month and I have n't received anything . I 'm over this company , Joy Hollywood . Clearly they do not know how to treat customers or sell working products . the product not only broke but it , like other consumers said , smelled like something awful . I would feel safer going to an actual store where they actually test the products to make sure they work . or where they will gladly return something that was a LEMON .
 I have tried rabbit toys in the past and they have all been great , so I was very excited to try this product . I got it in the mail , put batteries in it , and ... it would n't turn on . I wish I had read the reviews on this more carefully before buying this , as I see now that a lot of other people have had this issue . I really hope I can return it . Do n't waste your money - if you want a rabbit , you might as well buy a real good quality one so you do n't waste your money like I did .
 Received it broken but when talking to the customer help chat they refunded me ASAP . 110 % satisfied with their service . . ,
 I purchased this product expecting it to be fun but I am highly disappointed ... Ive had jackrabbits in the past this one was nothing at all close to the quality of others Ive owned I really wish I never purchased this one now . . First there is the STRONG unpleasant odor that it has itself very chemically and gross ! I washed it with 2 different soaps prior to use and it still made my hands and other parts smell like it ! That killed me and my husbands kink for the night . Secondly the levels on the motors that make the metal beads run around arent all that different from first to 3rd its barely noticeable when change it . I basically tossed money down the drain because I cant get over the stink of the thing to use it again and I am pretty sure I wont be buying products from this company again out of fear the rest are like this ! I 've never had a product I was so disappointed in seriously and I 've tried a lot . I certainly wouldnt recommend this product to friends or on the several forums I 'm on that we talk about such things . Sure you cant return a product once its used but someone shouldnt sell a product that isnt good in the first place . I 'm sure they all knew about the smell . I am sure there are testers they use ... Well lesson learned I guess . I do hope this is helpful at least for further designs in the future so others dont have to have this experience .
 I bought this item 6 months ago and was immediately disappointed . Metallic beads are a almost painful on higher rotation speed . And the the metallic rod connecting the top with the bottom broke after 6 months.Do not recommend this item .
 This is TERRIBLE . I have had this for 3 hours and it is already broken . It is absolutely NOT waterproof . Do NOT waste your money .
 I was really excited to receive this product after reading the reviews . A day later I 'm quite disappointed . The bunny ears are razor sharp ! Oucccchhhhhh !!! Definitely save your money and go for something else
 I was excited to try this vibrator at first because of the addition of the beads . I was really disappointed in this product however . It 's awkward to handle , using it and trying to use the buttons at the same time takes away from the focus on the sensations . The beads are far from pleasure enhancing , they felt awkward and sometimes pinch a bit if you change the direction during use . They are also bulky and and uncomfortable . The plastic is smooth on the outside which is n't necessarily a bad thing but I personally prefer some texture , it 's also really thin where the beads are , which I suppose is to allow sensation but considering I did n't like the way the beads felt ... I would 've preferred thicker plastic .
 Piece of crap . All functions did not work when opened and stopped working during first use ... horrible product . California Exotics should be ashamed of selling this junk . do not waste your money or shipping . .
 I only used it a couple of times , a tiny bit of water leaked into the battery compartment and now it is rusted and wo n't turn on .
 What a let down . I was so excited to get this because of the reviews , but when I tried it , it did nothing . First , it is very heavy and hard to hold -LRB- if you are using it by yourself -RRB- . Second , it hurts your clitoris . It is very sharp on the ears , that 's the part that goes on you clit . I 'm almost temped to cut them off . Third and forth , it smells and it is very loud.I 've tried it about 4 times , trying to get used to it . My husband has tried to use it on me too . No luck at all . This is not worth the money .
 This was much bigger then I had anticipated , that being my own fault . But the reason I gave it only 1 star is because the plastic was so hard it hurt ! The bunny for my clit irritated it and was not one bit pleasurable . So my man suggested I turn it around and then my taint became irritated ! Not one bit pleased with this product .
 While I LOVE the jack rabbit feature , the vibrator is overall too big for me to use . I can sort slip it inside but its tight and not very comfortable . Maybe because its too big , I can not feel the beads at all , I do n't think they have any room to move . The vibrator is also quite heavy . It would be perfect if it were more slender . So girls who are not very big down there might not want to buy this product .
 Nothing to to say about it thank u did n't enjoy it so why say something why rate it a waste of money
 Once again I wish I 'd paid closer attention to the more critical reviews ... This product is far too rigid and thick . With the beads and other material in the center , it does not bend at all , and it 's painful to try to use . There are also rigid bumps around the too-large tip -LRB- which is 1.5 inches wide , 5 inches around -RRB- that make it even more painful to insert . I 've used the similar - but far more realistic - Doc Johnson product -LRB- beads and rabbit , but none of those bumps , and a more natural tip and girth -RRB- and hoped it was the same thing , but it is n't . On the upside , it 's as quiet as the Doc Johnson product - and it 'll be even more quiet , unused , in my nightstand . Waste of money .
 I never actually got to use this product , when it arrived the bottom of the battery pack thingy was missing and when I attempted contacted the California Exotics customer service via both email and phone call I never received a response .
 The ears on the rabbit are sharp and the first time I used it I felt like it cut me after wards . If the ears were n't so sharp this toy would be higher on my list of favorites .
 The rotating beads jammed after 2 uses and no longer work . Also the item is non returnable so I ca n't even return it and get a new one . -RRB- :
 This is one of the worst one i ever bought . The price is kind of high so i expected it to have some use . There is no vibrating motion beside the rabbit head . Since this product can not be return , I used it once and went righ in the trash .
 I had high hopes for this product after the Rabbit Habit 's beads froze the first time I used it . I thought the way the beads were set in this product would be better and it was , BUT ... the material is so stiff that the action of the bunny ears actually HURT my clit ! None of the softness and thus realistic tongue like action of the Rabbit Habit . That 's really the point , is n't it ? It just poked me , along with the hard little nose , which also hurt . Cheap , but a waste of money .
 The picture shows several items when you select the purple one and has `` alternate views '' showing these items . And the kicker is that its 10 $ more than the other colors , so it seems like its a package deal , but I only got the one purple vibe . I totally would have gotten the clear one for less money if I knew that was the case because who cares what color it is really . I , for one , am about function over fashion . FALSE ADVERTISING !!
 This thing is awful ! The first time I used it water it filled up with water and shorted out . I 've dried it , replaced the batteries and it still wo n't work . I only used it 2 times . This is a total waste of money !
 I was misguided by the review ratings ... in all honesty , this product is awful . It has a toxic smell to it , and the `` bunny ears '' cause more pain than pleasure . I do n't recommend this product .
 Add me to the list of folks who received a vibrator-shaped paperweight instead of an actual vibrator . I tried two sets of batteries just to make sure , but it was dead . Also , as others have mentioned , the toxic plastic smell was over-powering , so I was a little bit glad it did n't work or I might have been tempted to try it and I may never have gotten that smell out of me . : o -RRB- Amazon , understandably , does n't allow returns on vibrators , but the paperwork for a refund was done in under an hour and I should get it in a few days , so at least that part was easily done .
 I purchased this via Amazon . It was delivered in a regular Amazon box . Inside the box , the vibrator was in a white plastic bag and inside its retail packaging . It takes 3 AA batteries . It has a slight chemical smell . The total length to the base is about 7 inches ; however , only about 5 inches is insertable due to the bunny on the side . It is very pliable and has raised bumps below the head on the opposite side of the bunny . It is approximately 5 inches in circumference . It has three levels of intensity and the head rotates . It does not thrust , it rotates around in a lopsided circle . There are 9 ball bearing in the shaft that go around in a circle . You can change the rotation from clockwise to counter-clockwise . Why change the direction of the rotation ? I do not know.The bunny is approximately 4 1/2 inches in length at its longest point , which is the base of the machine to its ears . On the short side , the bunny is about 2 1/2 inches in length . The bunny ears are pliable and separate , and the bunny has a pointy nose . There is a bullet inside the bunny . The bunny also has three levels of intensity.I like the rotation of the shaft and the thickness . The intensity in not bad , not earth shattering , but not bad . Here 's the down side . I just do n't get the bunny . If the ears are supposed to be the stimulation , the distance between the end of the ears and the end of the shaft are 2 3/4 inches . If I am supposed to use the bunny 's ears to tickle my clitoris , then I can only insert 2 3/4 inches of the shaft . If the nose is supposed to be the stimulation , then I can only insert 3 1/2 inches of the shaft to feel the bunny 's nose . If the bullet is the stimulation , then I have about 2 inches of bunny ears & nose keeping my clitoris away from the bullet . Because the bunny is attached to the shaft at five inches , there is no way that I can insert more than that , but when I do insert 5 inches , the bunny is way above my clitoris and uncomfortable . I read one comment that stated that she cut the ears of the bunny off . That may help , but not I 'm not trying that ... yet.The next concern is the rotation . You have to have a firm grip on the device for the rotation to work . It you insert the vibrator and hold it at the base , the head rotates . However , if you do not hold the vibrator tightly , the base rotates while the head stays fixed . Again , weird workings.I suggest that you look at this in a retail store . When you see it in person , you will understand what I mean about the bunny 's ears & nose being too high up the shaft . If you love the bunny and only want 2 3/4 to 3 1/2 inches of shaft , this may be the toy for you . Unfortunately , I am still looking for Mr. Right Vibrator .
 LOVE the size -- no complaints there . Rabbit ears hit in just the right spot . But , the beads on mine jammed up after a single use .
 It 's way too big for me . I bought it several months ago , and have used it maybe 3 times . It 's uncomfortable . Also , the picture is MISLEADING ! Inspecting it closer now , I see the little nubby on the pink jack rabbit , but it says nothing about there being several rows of hard , plastic nubbies near the head of the toy . Sad I wasted my money on this product .
 I am very hard to please because I like both clitoral stimulation and vaginal penitration ! This item does not work for what I intended it for ! I tried it twice and hated it both times I was so worked up from trying to make it work that I had to switch back to my bullet ! I gave it to my best friend after swabing it down with rubing alcohol ! She loves it she says it does the trick but it is deff not for me !
 Not made for the delicate sized person or in smaller areas of exploration . All features are as described and rabbit is fast on slowest setting . Smaller would be better .
 I gave this product as a `` special '' gift to my wife for Christmas , She just loved it for the first 2 times of use , except we had to make sure the kids were asleep because it is loud . Now it just spins away , but no vibrations . She will still use it on occasions , it can still get the job done , but for the money I payed it did n't last near long enough .
 I was not pleased with this product , the bunny ears does not reach my `` pretty bump '' ... I have n't used it ever since ... I bought another for $ 25 and it got to the work done way better than this ...
 Recieved this item and it was broken . Tried to contact the seller but could not . As per amazon 's return policy this is a non-returnable item . Which makes sense . Unless it is sold in a non-working condition . Was very displeased I could not speak directly with the seller and that amazon was of no help . Had to go through the manufacture to have the product replaced which is still a work in progress . Will not buy non-returnable items from this site again . Leaves too much room to get a defective product like I did and be stuck with it .
 Best Part ? Nice Girth -LRB- unusual for a rabbit -RRB- . Worst ? Length . I find it too short . And the `` off '' button has stopped working -LRB- maybe it wants to keep going and going and going ? * L * -RRB- I have to untwist the bottom pannel and loosen the batteries to turn it off.Overall it 's OK . It does what its supposed to and has worked out OK for the shower , but I 'd like to find something similar -LRB- but a little longer -RRB- for the shower.I also find the head to be a little too stiff , it should be made of something just a little softer .
 I received this product in the mail yesterday , Put in the batteries and the rotating beads do not work . Complete waste of money .
 I have only had this product for three months , and after a month I was having problems with this product . I have given up on this vibe , and I do not recommend buying this product . Spend the extra money on something that will actually last !
 This was my first purchase of a vibrator and was very disappointed . It was shipped very discreetly from Amazon directly , but it did n't work . I put in fresh batteries and it would n't turn on . I even tested the batteries , they were good , but this rabbit was n't . Unfortunately , Amazon does n't take returns on this type of personal product . I simple wo n't buy anything made by California Exotics again . I 'll try one of the other brands next time .
 It was a little big for me , but it worked really well until about two weeks ago . And then it just died . Mind you , this is two months after I bought it . I switched the batteries , made sure the ones I put in were working , but I suppose the motor died . I never even used it in water . I do n't know about most people , but for $ 30 , you 'd think you 'd get more than two months out of a vibrator .
 I do n't know why this has such good reviews . I purchased it because of the reviews but it 's since gone in the trash . It has an awful smell that wo n't go away . Like a burned plastic smell . It is WAY too big . The rotating beads do nothing for me . Even if you put your hand on the shaft , you have to squeeze to feel the rotation . Do n't buy it .
 This product worked for 4-5 times and the rotation stopped working . Batteries run out or lose power after 3-4 uses . I would read reviews before buying another one ... I am looking into the Hitachi wand massager now and I believe I will buy it since is a power operated toy and will never run out of power.Not impressed with this product .
 Beware ! After purchasing this toy , I looked at the website of a local sex toy shop , and noticed an article on sex toy safety . They warn that since this , and other , toys are listed as ` novelty ' items , they are unregulated by the FDA and may contain toxic materials that can cause cancers . One of the warning signs is a strong odor of rubber or plastic , which this toy definitely has , and the identification of the materials as ` jelly . ' I ca n't return this item , but I wish I never bought it .
 I read a previous review that said hers got a run the first time she used them and I figured I 'd just be more careful ... mine got a run the second time I used them ! Unless you 're desperate , do n't bother . I expected better quality for the price I paid !
 I tried these Jobst 15-20 mmHg pantyhose in my search for high quality therapeutic support pantyhose for a severe circulation problem in one of my legs . I did find them a little difficult to put on , but once they were on they stayed in place nicely and provided great support.The only problem I had was , like the other review stated ... they ran the second time I wore them . For as expensive as these pantyhose are , they should last longer than 2 wearings.They are not too sheer , if that is something you are looking for in support hose . They look more like tights when they are on your legs . I did find the beige shade to be a little more like a pale nude shade .
 I have worn Jobst compression hose for a few years now . I havenever had a problem . I was thrilled when I had the option fora sheer pair ... great for summer . The third time I wore one pair , I got a hole in them . I am not even sure how that happened . I figuredI must have done something . I put on my backup pair and the first timeI wore them I developed a hole in them ... the same leg -LRB- right one -RRB- . Nowthat I see these posts I know I will never purchase them again .
 I put them on at the doctor 's office and the first time I had to take them off , sure enough , ran them . Otherwise , liked them very much .
 Having read the previous reviewers ' reports warning about how easily this product could develop runs , I was super careful and tried very much to make my expensive pair last . The first time I had this pantyhose on , I got a bad run that ruined this very expensive pair of hosiery ! Unbelievable !

 I had TWO of these products sent to me and BOTH of them were inoperatable and the packaging on one of them was open ... ughhhh ... VERY disappointed not to mention frustrated !
 While the flexability is nice this uses non standard triple a batteries which is uncommon for most vibrators . Size is actually a little small and no twisting inside , I would recommend this to ladies who like it small or first timers .
 I purchased this chair 4 years ago and am a mechanical engineer.At the 14 month point , -LRB- 2 months after the warranty expired -RRB- the chair stopped working . I took it apart and discovered the upper journal bearing had cracked and failed . This is the bearing which holds the massage mechanism . It bears all of your back weight and it 's spinning is converted into the roller motion . That might sound fancy , but when you look at it , it is a small plastic part.When I contacted support , they would not sell me the bearing or even to upper support assembly . The only option was to buy the whole massage mechanism , motor and all for $ 130 . I was frustrated , but I loved the massage , so I purchased and installed the mechanism.It is a self contained unit , so unplug a few connectors , bolt it down ... an easy replacement .18 months later it broke again and I threw it away.I am a 170lb man who used it maybe twice a week for 30 minutes.In my second deconstruction , I noted it again broke in the upper support area . In my opinion , this is not a well designed chair .
 As a Noni user for many years , when my preferred vendor had some delivery delays ordered this brand of Noni . When it arrived was disappointed to see not PURE Noni juice , but rather adulterated Noni with fruit juice . I use NONI not for the taste , but the health benefits , yes NONI tastes bad , but I want the benefit of the NONI not additives to make it taste better . Ca n't recommend this product .
 THESE CLIPPERS FELL APART WITHEN TWO WEEKS.I 'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH POORLY MADE CLIPPERS.DO NOT BUY.THE PART HOLDING IT ALL TOGETHER FELL OUT WHILE USEING IT .

 After reading all the great reviews on this product on Amazon , I decided to go for this . I do n't typically have good results from diet products , but I figured I 'd give it a shot . I 've been taking these for 3 weeks , as directed , and I might as well have been taking sugar pills for all the more this is doing for me . I felt like my appetite increased , I have n't lost any weight at all - in fact I 've been fluctuating up and down 3 pounds for the past couple of weeks . I gave this two stars because I did n't feel the anxiety or sleeplessness that some people complained about , but I 'm still disappointed . I was hoping I 'd find something that actually worked !
 Well , it arrived on time and in OK condition , but after almost a month of taking it , I have n't noticed any change , except now I have stomach cramps .
 I do not recommend it , I developed a bad break of acne in my body specially by the stomach and back , the second day of using.Still have the scars and they look like I got chicken pox , I totally regret buying this cleanser.After my acne break out , I looked over the internet for reviews and most of them were bad too . -LRB- like people developing hives and ezcema break outs . -RRB-
 Did not use as my G.I. Dr. said that a recent study showed that they do not help .
 The rollator might have been en excellent one , and was keenly waited for.However , 2 days past it 's expected latest arrival time , it had not arrived . The company that was supposed to send it admitted that they had printed the shipping label , notified Amazon and us that it had been shipped , but had not done so.They offered a pink one which was absolutely not suitable for the male user , so I demanded the money back , which they promptly did . I was underwhelmed by the professionalism of that company , and notified Amazon.com about it .
 I read a previous review that said hers got a run the first time she used them and I figured I 'd just be more careful ... mine got a run the second time I used them ! Unless you 're desperate , do n't bother . I expected better quality for the price I paid !
 I tried these Jobst 15-20 mmHg pantyhose in my search for high quality therapeutic support pantyhose for a severe circulation problem in one of my legs . I did find them a little difficult to put on , but once they were on they stayed in place nicely and provided great support.The only problem I had was , like the other review stated ... they ran the second time I wore them . For as expensive as these pantyhose are , they should last longer than 2 wearings.They are not too sheer , if that is something you are looking for in support hose . They look more like tights when they are on your legs . I did find the beige shade to be a little more like a pale nude shade .
 I have worn Jobst compression hose for a few years now . I havenever had a problem . I was thrilled when I had the option fora sheer pair ... great for summer . The third time I wore one pair , I got a hole in them . I am not even sure how that happened . I figuredI must have done something . I put on my backup pair and the first timeI wore them I developed a hole in them ... the same leg -LRB- right one -RRB- . Nowthat I see these posts I know I will never purchase them again .
 I put them on at the doctor 's office and the first time I had to take them off , sure enough , ran them . Otherwise , liked them very much .
 Having read the previous reviewers ' reports warning about how easily this product could develop runs , I was super careful and tried very much to make my expensive pair last . The first time I had this pantyhose on , I got a bad run that ruined this very expensive pair of hosiery ! Unbelievable !

 The band was far too thin and would roll down my leg continuously . I returned all pairs I bought for a refund . Very disappointing for a Jobst product .

 The cushions fell apart - split in half and does not stay on your feet . Do not buy - very poor product .
 I never really write reviews , but after using this product I felt a strong need to do so . I had been researching hoodia for a little while , and decided that I would try this product since it was inexpensive and had free shipping . I have lost weight using this , combined with exercise and a large cutback in caloric intake , but have some issues with this product . Since I have researched more , I have found that hoodia is very expensive , so it seems unlikely that this company would strengthen the concentration of hoodia 20:1 and sell it for ten dollars a box . Most other reputable hoodia brands cost around $ 50 for a nondiluted 100 % hoodia stock , so I have doubts about whether this product contains any hoodia at all . However , this does contain A LOT of caffeine . I typically only drink 1 cup of tea during the day , and found that taking these pills do make me jittery and keep me up at night . Even sleeping pills have not helped me to fall asleep . The box also suggests that if you would like to increase the amount of weight lost , you can take double the amount instructed . I have also tried this , and found that I act as though I am totally high . I am off the wall , feel disconnected , and can not come down for many hours . This combination of single and double doses -LRB- I have stopped taking the double -RRB- have caused me to lose sleep almost the entire time that I have been taking it . The box instructs you not to take these pills in the evening if you can not sleep after taking caffeine , but I can drink coffee right before bed and not have an issue . These pills are a different story . The lastest that I have been taking these pills is 1pm and still not been able to sleep at 10 . I know that this is long , but I wanted other people who may be interested in trying this , to know about my experiences before they spend their money . Since ordering this pack of three , I have done a lot more investigating and have actually purchased a different brand of 100 % south african hoodia that comes with all of the required paperwork for the legit pills . By the way , this product does not include the required c.i.t.e.s. and other documentation stating that it actually comes from south africa , or that it has been tested by an independent lab confirming its contents.In conclusion , I have lost weight with this product , but I think that it may be due to the amount of stimulants , and not the hoodia that I do n't believe is included .
 I bought some pills for myself and some of my friends to try out . They felt fine but I could n't even take two -LRB- out of three -RRB- doses of the pill in one day . This stuff made me feel really nauseas , queezy , and a bit disoriented and restless - which I attribute to the caffeine in this product because I can barely drink one cup of coffee without feeling kind of weird.I never thought diet pills were the solution , and this product just confirms that . I strongly recommend working on the internal issues as to why you ca n't loose the weight instead of searching for shortcuts .

 Nice in theory , but does n't really do the trick . We thought the longer shaft and small profile would make it easy to hold it in the right spot during intercourse to give me the extra zing necessary . The problem is , the surface is difficult to press up against the right spot . If the paddle had a nub on it or it was convex would make it a lot better.I was also disappointed in the speed/strength . In order to turn it on , you have to twist the base . The problem is , it goes from zero to full strength . No gradual increase . The strength is a little much to start off , and usually not enough after a short while . It would be nice if the power were adjustable.Positive
 I am truly surprised to see all the 5 star reviews here for these Zoe 's Chocolate Delight bars . They just do n't taste good at all to me . There is something `` off '' about the taste . The chocolate does n't really taste much like chocolate at all -- I 'm not sure how to describe it . In addition , there is an aftertaste that other people have mentioned they noticed in Zoe bars . Even taking into account that they are designed to be lower in refined sugar and higher in fiber , they are still quite bland and could use more sweetness . In no way do they taste even close to a candy bar like other protein bars can . I am a major connoisseur of the lower-sugar , lower-calorie , higer-fiber protein bars , and I have to say that Zoe 's bars rank last in my opinion . I have had many other bars with the same approximate amount of sugar and number of calories that were all sweeter , more filling , more satisfying , and simply taste way better all around . Three of my favorites that I would recommend
 I try new energy/protein bars for variety and to see if I 'm missing out on something . The Zoe bars are a major disappointment . The roof of my mouth feels like it is coated with a grainy wax when I finish eating the bars . Unless you enjoy wax , spend your money on many good alternative bars and skip the Zoe 's .
 I 've tried all 3 Zoe Bars . -LRB- Are there more . . ? -RRB- My personal favorite is the chocolate-peanut butter one . I 've purchased 4 boxes in the last few months of that flavor and love them as a between meal snack . They are the only thing I 've found that can replace sweets for me and with no guilt after eating.BUT ... The chocolate ones are not good tasting nor is it a good texture . Too dense , too strange , odd chocolate similarity but not really chocolate and bad aftertaste . Even worse , however , are the peanut butter ones . I gave those away . At least I 'll most likely eat these eventually .
 The first thing I noticed about these is they are very dense , with a very waxy but dry and gritty texture . And there really is only a slight chocolate flavor , with a strange aftertaste . They are filling though , but then again so is eating compressed cardboard !

 Just throw them away after 12 hours ? I assume these are plastic . So , folks after 12 hours they are obsolete , and throw them out to create more useless landfill trash that will last 10 millenia ! Yay , hooray !
 I bought 5 of theese for 20.00 dollars . I turned all of them on at 10:10 p.m. . At exactly 10:11 p.m. they shut off and would n't turn back on . They had lost all of their battery and I was forced to throw them away because what is the use of a BROKEN litecube . They JUST HAVE TO make a charger for these . They were cool until they went out .

 I have some acne scars around my face and I was hoping that this product would provide any assistance with it.It in fact did nothing to the appearance and through the weeks that I used it , I started to even break out in acne . I had more acne appearing on my skin than the months preceding this product . Completely disappointed but what can I expect from products in America

 I started this a week ago and within one day of taking it as directed , i developed hives and full body rash . I know the possibility of these side effects was stated , but the degree is more extreme than expected . I stopped taking it on Tuesday and it is now Friday . The incredibility itchy rash continues . Use at your own risk .
 This stuff ... sucks . At first , I was all gung-ho about trying it after reading Jillian Michael 's book , Making the Cut . It 's one of the supplements she recommends for women with an underactive thyroid . I do n't have hypothyroidism , but my numbers are low so I figured I might as well give it a whirl . 10 lbs later , I realized I may be taking more than just `` guggul '' . My doctor thinks there might have even been some type of steroid-like substance in it , because I gained 10 lbs in a month ! I am a healthy eater , and I work out 5-6 days/week because I 'm also a personal trainer . The way I see it . . do n't waste your money , if you think you have a thyroid problem , go to an endocrinologist and get the real drugs , the ones where you know exactly what 's in them .
 Useless , just a junk kit . Do not waste ur time or pennies on this item . If it was free and I had to checkin to sign up to get it , I would refuse it ! Junk !
 This review is for the Sunglass Eyeglass Repair Kit 77pc DELUXE Sold by
 The pic was so small - could n't see that it was exclusively screws - no nuts at all . I did n't lose my screws - I lost a nut on my glasses . How can you send out an eye class repair kit with no nuts ? Please send me some nuts for my eye glasses .
 the keychain is useful and works good , so if you are getting this to tighten up your glasses , its great . but i bought it to replace a cushion on my glasses . the screws are so small you can barely hold them in your fingers let alone secure it in place to try to screw it in , even with someone else helping me . you are better off getting your glasses repaired in a shop . but i do like the keychain .
 The case is pretty much useless . Nothing stays in the small compartments . I really dont know why they exist . The small screwdriver , both flathead & phillips are cheap material . You cant magnetize it in order to hold the screws which would make all the difference considering the size of the screws .
 I was quite surprised to find that about half the screws in this kit were defective in that they did not have any cut in the head for a screwdriver . They looked loke little threaded rivets ? No way to use them without a way to turn the screw . Quality rip off .
 I am a writer and have to work 8 hours straight at a keyboard for clients when on tight deadlines . It was suggested by a specialist that I ice my wrists every night . I thought this would be a neat way to do it . The concept is good but the beads never get cold enough to accomplish the therapy and subsequent relief needed .
 I have this toothpaste and the ADA seal of approval is nowhere to be found on the tube . It does n't whiten either .
 As advertised , the unit is portrayed as an APC OEM replacement cartridge with OEM APC parts . When the unit arrived it was clearly a remanufactured item using batteries from `` ABC '' -LRB- manufactured in Vietnam -RRB- . The advertisement as presented does not mention that the item is a remanufactured part using non-OEM parts . This is my first experience with UnbeatableSale and it will certainly be my last .
 This product smells disgusting , not like plumeria products I have bought . If you like plumeria , do not buy ... ... ... ...
 Was not informed it was going to take a month to received the order . Be careful using amazon .
 These balls are not hard ; it 's cheap plastic one with lots of air in it , which makes it squish . . if you are looking to massage you feet by applying any amount of pressure , do n't get this . I tried it for about 3 minutes and one of them popped and is not useless . time to return it
 This product smells disgusting , not like plumeria products I have bought . If you like plumeria , do not buy ... ... ... ...
 I already returned a book so I could n't see returning this
 I could n't believe my eyes when I saw the amazingly low price for this product . I guess I got what I paid for since these pills did not work at all . The ingredients list the same as Phazyme but offered no relief .
 This product did not work for me . Even though the active ingredients are the same as name brands , the formulation seems to be different . For the price , you might want to try a bottle to see if it will work for you .
 I ordered this Futuro Stabilizing Knee Support because I wanted a beige colored one -LRB- I have a black McDavid knee brace and it did not come in beige -RRB- , but I was a little disappointed with it . I do n't get the support I get with my McDavid one . I will still use the Futuro , but not for walking for a long distance .
 Your inventory of Futuro Knee braces is bad and is being investigated by one of your Customer Service persons . I speak with confidence because I have worn the same brand , style , and size brace for years . The first shipment of 2 braces consisted of one correct package but the other was a `` small '' size clearly marked -LSB- package and product lable -RSB- as `` medium '' . When the exchange shipment arrived , both packages contained `` small '' size braces but the lables and packages were clearly marked `` medium '' . Both shipments have been returned in the last few days . In my mind this is obviously a manufacturers problem . To this day Amazon has been trying to resolve this issue . I am waiting for instructions on how to obtain the proper items .
 Absolutely disguising , I had to hype myself up to swallow it down and it did n't even work for me . If there is a pill form , try those because this was GROSS
 This product was recommended to me by my lactation consultant and was said to be much stronger than drinking the Mother 's Milk tea and more effect than using the More Milk Plus capsules . I followed the directions exactly as followed in terms of not drinking fluids 15 minutes before/after taking this and tried it for a over a week . I barely saw any increases in my milk supply at all . Maybe this just did n't work for me .
 I was getting nervous about not having enough milk to send to the babysitter 's for my daughter . I am only producing 2 bottles of milk a day while I am at work and she takes three at the sitters . I used to be able to get three while I was at work . I started using this product and used it for 3 weeks straigt with no change ! In fact , the only changes that occured was even lower production . I have since stopped taking it and have to supplement at the babysitter 's house with one bottle of formula ... which my daughter hates ! I will say that since I have stopped taking it I feel like my production has gone back up . I do n't know if it 's me just coming to terms with having to supplement with formula or what . I wish it would have worked for me but it did n't ... I should n't have bought 2 bottles before even trying it ; -RRB- I hope this helps and I hope others have more luck than me ! My GYN swears by this stuff ! It just was n't for me .
 This stuff tates horrible smells horrible and does not work . My daughter has actually had less milk production since shes started using it . After weeks of hopeing it would start working she has completely quit using it and has thrown it away . I would not recommend this product to anyone.The company who shipped to me were great !!!! I received the product way before i expected I would .
 I did n't buy this product from Amazon but wanted to share my opinion of it here.This stuff tastes absolutely horrible ! Since I am over 175 lbs I had to take the larger dose . I came close to throwing up when I took it , even if I took a sip of water to wash it down I dry heaved for about 15 minutes after . But I figured it would be worth it . Well a week later and I am still struggling with my milk output and my stomach is in knots all day from this stuff -LRB- I hear it can cause stomach upset -RRB- I was taking Fenugreek before with decent results but needed more so I thought this would help , I think I got better results with Fenugreek now that I think about it . With this , I dont even get the `` maple syrup smell '' that you are supposed to get -LRB- this is how you know you are taking enough and it is active in your system -RRB- . Another review suggested that this product seems to work better for skinny moms below 175 , maybe that is the case , because it did n't work for me either.I will be switching back to Fenugreek today . What a waste of $ 30 !!!! Maybe the health food store I bought it from will allow me to return it ? Who knows .
 Wife did n't have any luck with this product . Much more luck with the fenugreek . She also claimed this tasted like &#34; goat ass . &#34; She has a way with words . The do not drink before and after instructions are a pain . That and the taste of goat ass that you ca n't wash away makes this a lowsy product .
 I 'm not going to go into the effectiveness of Motherlove 's More Milk Plus but want to warn - Careful , this particular formula has grain alcohol . I bought without knowing or realizing it . I have been using the one WITHOUT alcohol and ran out so bought this on Amazon and noted that it tasted different - it burns -LRB- like taking straight shots of vodka -RRB- and tastes bad . Upon checking ingredients it shows 42-52 % grain alcohol!My preference is for the one without alcohol because it tastes sweeter -LRB- actually got so used to it I ended up liking it very much - imagine my distaste when I first put this in my mouth -RRB- . Not only that , it makes me uncomfortable worrying about traces of alcohol in my b-milk . So 2 stars for this but I 'd give the one w/o alcohol 5 stars because it helps with production .
 had twins . bought this when having trouble with one not nursing as well as my milk slowed down . did not really seem to make a difference in the amount of milk . tasted gross , I would take it in a shot of water . contains alcohol from the natural herbs . I think its better to nurse often to get better milk as that made a bigger difference on its own than when I used this in conjunction with more nursing , probablly from the alcohol ?
 I did not see a increase in supply with this product . I did notice that my pumped milk was more fatty after sitting in the fridge though . I was taking a double dose and took it round the clock , never missing a dose . I am past a year of breastfeeding and that may be why I did not see a boost . The alcohol taste is completely disgusting . I felt like my breath reaked of the alcohol afterwards and I just could n't rid the taste from my mouth for several hours . If I try it again with future children , I will definately make sure I get the alcohol free version !
 ugh . when i bought this it was around $ 30.00 , and 4 ounces ai n't much when you are taking it three times a day . i am really not a believer in any sort of `` holistic medicine '' . i draw the line at lavender oil during a massage smelling nice and that somehow helps you to relax , so needless to say i was not convinced this was going to help increase my supply , but out of desperation tried it anyway . i took it 3 times a day , waited to have anything to drink 20 mins before and 20 mins after until the entire bottle was gone . the only effect it had on me was making me smell like i had just spent three hours stocking shelves at an indian grocery store . i have learned so much more about lactation now . what actually works is more nursing , nursing as much as possible , tying you and baby to the couch and offering the nipple all day long . pumping after feeding helped a little , but increasing my nursing helped more . eventually , i finally had to start ordering domperidone online from canada , which is an actual legit medication and that did increase my supply . apparently it works for some of you , but i 'd like to see some actual scientific studies on this stuff . mama 's , give yourself time to build your supply , nurse , nurse , nurse . co-sleep and night nurse , do n't bottle feed when in public - be brave and just do it , nurse ! if all else fails domperidone has been proven scientifically to produce more milk . annnnd do n't get me started on those stupid `` lactation cookies '' recipes that keep floating around . you have enough work with a newborn , keep it simple and keep the baby at the breast .

 I was referred to this product by a lactation consultant who swore by it . I had gone back to work a few weeks prior and my supply was dwindling severly due to the pump not being nearly as efficient as my little man . I began taking far more than the recommended dose of the More Milk Plus , in an effort to really up my supply . The product tasted really nasty , even when mixed with a strong tasting drink and I did not see any major difference in my supply .
 This product obviously works well for most but it made my twins extremely fussy , gassy , and spit up like crazy . Not only did I hate to see them screaming with discomfort , but it was the hardest day I 've had yet as a new mom to twins . Yes , I said `` day . '' I took MMP as directed for only one day . The babies fussed all day and night leaving me no time to pump to even see if there was an increase in supply . I cut out the MMP and went back to plain fenugreek the next day and everyone is happy again . I 'm pretty sure it 's the blessed thistle that caused the issues . I tried previously adding blessed thistle capsules to my supplementation routine and we had similar issues , although not anywhere near the degree as with MMP . I hate leaving a negative review for a product so widely loved and touted , but I did n't find anything about effects similar to my experience so I felt the need to share .
 The batteries are new and the watch TALKS . . but the numbers only partially show up on the display . The watch worked perfectly for the first few days then it started acting up . . I changed the batteries and the problem still exists .
 I tried this brand of oil of oregano when the brand I usually buy only had the huge bottle available and I found that out of my price range.I wish I had splurged , though , because I do n't think this product actually did anything ; I did n't notice a difference in how i was feeling . I think it 's worth it to buy the Gaia brand Oil of Oregano , instead .
 Have tried the more expensive product from North American and it cleared up mine and my husband 's stuffy noses within 24 hrs . Occasionally you would get a slight after burp with that product . With this product , I 've been taking for a week and I still have a stuffy nose and never an after burp . Plus the capsules are huge compared to p73 .
 The watch is in perfect condition but can not set the time and it keeps going dead . I thought it was a new watch but acts like a used watch . I wont order from this vendow again .
 This LOOKS like a less expensive version of the Spinbrush refill , but it is not . With this one , the bottom part does not move . Cheap junk ! I do n't know why they bother making it.Get the better one - it 's worth it .
 It 's not the same as the one the brush comes with . The top spins but you loose the up down motion from the brushes under the spin part . cheap knock off I guess . spend more get the right one . : -LRB-
 I was thrilled to see what a bargain these replacement heads were compared to the store . I ended up throwing them out and going to the store . Do n't waste your money . The top part of the head rotates , but the bottom half does nothing . The `` real '' ones , both parts of the head rotate . I do n't know why this even says CREST on it .
 I have the Bandit product and got another one but wanted something that I can alternate and wear at work without looking like a lost squash player.This did not give me any relief and after adjusting it every which way it just did not cut the mustard . The only time it gave me relief was when it also kept blood flowing to my fingers.I would give it one star but I am going to use it as a fancy - and pricey - cuff guard instead so I do n't get chain grease on my trousers .
 Futuro makes another version that is like a compression sleeve that extends above and below the elbow and has two forearm pressure points . I find it to be much easier to use . This one goes on fine , then slides down frequently . If I try pulling my sleeve up and adjusting it , it slides down again when I try to get the sleeve back down over it . If you might be using this while wearing long sleeves , or you do n't want to have to make adjustments throughout the day , I recommend checking out the other version that just says `` Elbow '' and not this sport version .
 You know those First Aid kits you get from the dollar store ? The ones in the small , white plastic box ? Well , those are better than this . Why ? Well , for $ 8 , I 'll list what you get.-A white plastic box , measuring 5 '' X 4 '' X 1-1/2 '' - Eight plastic bandages , 1 '' X 3-1/4 '' -LRB- bootleg BandAids -RRB- - Four 2 '' X 2 '' gauze pads.-Four BZK towelettes.-Two single-use packs of 1 % hydrocortisone cream.-Two two-tablet packsets of aspirin -LRB- 325mg each tablet -RRB- - Two two-tablet packets of acetaminophen -LRB- 325mg each tablet -RRB- - Roll of breathable tape , 1/2 '' wide by 72 '' long.-Gauze roll , 2-1/2 '' wide by 24 '' long.-Pair of low-quality bandage scissors.This kit is n't compact , is n't cheap , and does n't even have good contents . Buy the dollar store kit , add some extras to it , and you 'll be more prepared for less money than this kit . And it will be smaller .
 I used this product for about a week and a half then decided to stop using it . At first I had the straps adjusted too tight which made my foot and leg hurt from squeezing too much . Then I loosened them and thought it would be better but my foot hurt so much that I would wake up about 3AM in pain and would have to take it off and the sound of velcro peeling away at 3AM also wakes up the person beside you too . When you lay down your foot naturally wants to turn to the side and with this brace on , it put pressure against the side of my foot which was tolarable for a few hours but then it would really start hurting where the strap went around my foot . If I kept my foot pointed straght up then it did not pull but that is n't how my foot is naturally positioned when I sleep . It 's a little pricy for what it actually is .
 Maybe it was my bad to buy a knockoff product that was so cheap . Compared to Gum brand picks , Doctor 's BrushPicks are unusable . The picks have no flexibility or give . Maybe I could use them to clean out tiny metal machine parts .
 I have been taking astragalus supplements for a very long time . I dicided to give Gaia 's liquid gel pill a try , hoping for better absorption . However , only after a couple of days of taking it , I developed a lot of hives all over my body . When I examed the pills , I saw that every pill was only half filled with liquid . This can be indications that the pills were very old that the liquid had been dried up and poor packaging . I stoped taking it and threw out the opened bottle . I kept the unopened one so I can send to a lab for testing later . Will NEVER buy any Gaia product again !
 What a waste . You 'd be just as well off with scotch tape . I threw it away . Yes , it was that bad .
 I also agree that it 's like scotch tape . I tried several strips , peeling from multiple angles , and none of them worked . Instead , I got a swelling eyelid the next day . This product does n't work at all .
 These do not work at all . I have waxed hot and cold wax for years for my own touch ups inbetween salon waxings . This does nothing but pull off some debris if your skin is not spotless . Besides that the price is crazy high considering you will use 4 each time for both upper / lower on both brows .
 I have tried similar products in the past , but was n't very satisfied . After reading the excellent reviews for this one , i gave it a try . I am disappointed . Even though it comes in precut shapes and is cold wax , it did not do a very good job on my eybrows . It left a lot of hairs . The shape of the precut wax strips is n't very good neither - it did n't match my eybrows very well . My conclusion so far from my experience with at home wax products is that nothing does as good of a job as you get in a salon .
 These strips are nothing more than scotch tape in the shape of eyebrow removers . They may take off one or two hairs , but they do n't come close to doing what they are supposed to .
 Hair Off Instant Eyebrow Shapers Cold Wax Strips 18 's did n't really did not work for me so I will not be buying this brand anymore
 They do n't work !!! It pulls the hair , it just does n't take it off ... Maybe it works different for other people , but they did not work for me .
 Buy a roll of scotch tape . Cheaper and same effect . Was a total waste of money . I was so disappointed .
 This product does not live up to all its claim . It does n't work ! It barely takes off the hair from my eyebrows .
 I bought these because I read a bunch of positive reviews but they really suck ! They look like little pieces of tape and they barely remove any hair . I do n't recommend this product to anyone .
 I purchased this product last week and discovered that it was garbage . The strips shape is terrible and it does not remove the hair . Complete waste ... : -LRB-
 This product did n't work as well as I had hoped . It does n't hurt , but it also does n't remove all of the hair . I had to go behind and pluck my eyebrows -LRB- even longer hairs that should have been picked up by the strips -RRB- . Save your money and buy wax instead .
 These were way to expensive and I can not believe that I bought these . You might as well as get a piece of tape and try to use that . It will be just as effective . Which means not at all . go with sally hansens . do not buy from here .
 You might as well wax your eyebrows with duct tape - it is cheaper and will produce the same results as this product . This stuff pulls as much skin off as it does hair , so beware .
 I guess I am guilty of having too high an expectation , or maybe just stubborn hair . Either way I am not impressed . I still have to tweeze after using the strips . I made the initial mistake of trying to use the stipps repeatedly on the same area when the the strips did n't get it all the first time ... big mistake . I 'll use them to do an overall , but tweezing is still necessary.Maybe I just did n't hold my mouth right ...
 Let me just say , these are awful . They do n't take any hair with them , I 've followed all directions properly and tried a whole sheet of them but none of them worked.Don ' t waste your time or money on this product .
 It does not work at all ! Or if I used it wrong ? Anyway I threw away the whole box . Waste of money .
 I bought this in hopes of getting nicely DIY shaped eyebrows and avoiding the hassle of spending $ 20 every 3 weeks to get my eyebrows painfully waxed . I followed the instructions and had an oil/dirt free face when I tested this product . Everything was going great until I pulled the strips off . They did n't work . The strip pulled my hair but did not remove it . I do n't think that they were sticky enough or I did n't press down on them hard enough to stick completely . On the bright side , this was cheap when I purchased it .
 the shape of these is so weird . no eyebrow has that shape . it 's ok at removing hair . it has to be long for it to come completely of , does n't work well on the little hairs
 I bought this product according to the good reviews and its not worth your time and money . The product feels like putting a piece of cheap tape and nothing coming out . Dont buy this product !! Its very cheap !!
 I was so surprised and upset to see polyethylene glycol listed under the ` other ingredients ' . Obviously the type of people that would order this are extremely health conscious and aware individuals . I have already sent this back unopened . I will see if I can find a similar product without the chemicals .
 I had no issues with my initial order . The first box was 100 % useable , so I went ahead and ordered two more . What a waste ! Second box had 4 bad tablets ... ok , not so good but I overlooked it . Last box
 Deodorant control works by gluing you pits shut . Seriously , this stuff was sticky and nasty .
 This was a handy device which worked nicely to trim nose and ear hairs on this aging head . But after one year of not that frequent use it just died . Until it died , I did enjoy it . It 's a bit pricey for 12 months of use .
 This product did not even last two days before it began to fall apart . The black backing separated from the front after two uses . The pumice coating developed bare spots after only four uses . These were normal uses according to the instructions . This may have been a good product in the past , but it is a terrible product now .
 If you are nervous about slipping in the shower or do n't have good balance , do n't get this ! It really needs little suction cups or something to stay in place . You have to step on it with one foot to be able to use it on the other foot and it just left me tipping and almost falling every time . I ended up using in on the carpeted floor , sitting on the couch and even then , it was difficult to file every angle of my heel . Would n't recommend if you want a good file on your feet .
 I had one of these in use for about two years , and everything was fine with it ... recently , I changed it for a new one , and it came apart within a week ... I do n't recommend it anymore ... at all .
 the one i got says `` cleanse '' on the box , I do n't know what it means , but I know that I picked the one that does n't say `` cleanse '' on the box . i 'm all the more angry because that one costs way cheaper . and all the more am i angry because i 'm not going to bother to go through the refund process . plus it took it ages to arrive
 I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about . I followed the directions nothing happened . Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea . On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period - I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened ! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else . Strange .
 I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed . As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen -LRB- my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was -RRB- . Sadly , it was this tea . I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also . It is so gross . I have tried adding honey , drinking it cold , drinking it hot , etc and they all taste horrible . As far as a diet aid , I do n't think so . I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you , possibly . I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen -LRB- and no , I was not on the toilet a lot either -RRB- . All in all , this product was a big thumbs down to me .
 I ordered this product a week ago and I have not recieved it yet . I do n't know where it is . My credit card has been charged and their has been no tea as of yet on my doorstep . I am not happy . I go to the tracking site and it ca n't even tell me where it is . I do n't see a number anywhere to call . I fear I 've been duped .
 though i did not purchase this through amazon , i did get this recently from thw grocery store , and have to admit im really disappointed . i followed the instructions the first evening EXACTLY as instructed with the included paper , and no results . the second day , i brewed just a little longer , still no luck , -LRB- basing this off some other comments from other users here on amazon -RRB- then today i only did 6oz , not 12 as the paper instructs , and even brewed this for 6 minutes . still nothing.i really wanted this to work for me like it has for others , i had heard good things and was so excited , but still no luck . i guess im one of those people this doesnt affect . ill keep trying it daily till i run out , but looks like ill have to try something else.as for taste , its not bad . just tastes like tea leaves , not deliciously fantastic , but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable . good luck to anyone else . hope you have more success with this than i did
 I was so hoping to love this product after reading some of the good reviews , however , these made me so nauseous and sick . i do n't think i can ever drink tea again because of how sick these made me feel . It might have just been a reaction to my system , and my system only ... but i 'm throwing my box away !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! : o -LRB-
 I got the tea fast , and followed the instructions , only drinking 1/2 cup , which had no effect on my system , it taste pretty good though .
 I 'm a large guy , and I just weighed in at DOCTOR at 346 , he said `` Lose weight . '' I got this scale to track my weight , set it up and guess what in less that a week , I 'm 306 , that 's 38 pounds off the doctors scale . UNless these people call me to correct this complaint , I got RIPPED OFF BY DETECTO . What it detects is INNACURASY.VERY UNHAPPY , DO N'T BUY IT !
 It comes with no instructions as to how to set the scale corectly . Nothing . The scale is not accurate I believe because we do n't know how to set it correctly .
 After throwing out an inconsistent digital scale , I opted to spend a little extra money for a beam scale . However , this purchase has been a complete disappointment . The parts are light weight and cheap . Definately not the sort of quality that one would find in a doctor 's office . The beam feels like it is made of aluminum and the fulcrum seems to be plastic . The `` slide '' is also light weight . The light weight parts tend to stick . This scale definately does not have the smooth operation associated with scales found in a physician 's office containing heavier parts.However , the main problem with the scale is its imprecision . Depending on whether the scale is initially set too light or too heavy , my weight can vary by up to 3 or 4 pounds - all without even stepping off the scale . How can I simulateously weigh both 185 lbs and 188.5 lbs ? I do n't know , perhaps Detecto 's quality control department is run by quantum physicists . Regardless , the scale is complete garbage - although it might contain a couple of bucks worth of aluminum if one chose to recycle it.I bought an Escali B180RC 2 weeks ago . Much better scale at a quarter of the price .
 This did not work very well , at all . I ended up throwing it out after a very short period of time . I would go with the Health o meter !
 THE SCREWS WENT IN OKAY , BUT THE HOOK WILL NOT GO ON PROPERLY AND NOW I HAVE TO SEND IT BACK , CALL , OR SPEND MY PERSONAL TIME TO GET IT TO WORK RIGHT . THERE WERE NO INSTRUCTIONS EITHER TO HELP . IT JUST NEEDS TO HOOK ON TO A BAR BUT IT WO N'T REACH . A LOT OF HASSLE . DOES AMAZON OR DETECTO CARE TO CONTACT ME AND MAKE ME A SATISFIED CUSTOMER ? WE 'LL SEE . I AM REQUESTING A PHONE CALL FROM BOTH OR EITHER OF THEM SO THIS PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED , OR PLEASE COME PICK IT UP AT YOUR EXPENSE .
 The scale calibrates but then does not weigh accurately from one weighing to the next . I thought this was supposed to be medical grade ?!?
 The good thing about the shipping was it was fast ... other than that ... The column of the scale was pretty badly mangled when it arrived . The draft rod was bowed and rammed into the assembly of the balance arm . A few of the metal parts of the weighing mechanism seemed at odd angles and pretty torqued . A call to customer service was n't answered so I tried to figure out how to fix it but ended up just horsing on it with pliers until it broke loose . The screw holes did n't quite match up -LRB- before the horsing too -RRB- . I 'm not sure if it could pass a US Standards and Measures inspection right now , but it appears to be functioning with unknown accuracy . I 'll try to email to find out but I 'm not expecting much help . It also had a slip that said it passed inspection by two individuals . I 'm not sure how they inspect their product but it obviously did n't include making sure the balance arm/dectector rod moved freely . I do n't think I would buy anything from this company again since I feel they goofed up the product by packaging . It must have taken lots of pressure to ram the rod into the assembly that deeply .
 I bought this product because I was looking for a good soluble fiber supplement to help with my digestion , but I started finding the tablets never dissolved in my digestive tract . So then I ran an experiment , I poured boiling water over it and put a tablet in a cup to see if it would disolve , nope it did not dissolve - It DID N'T DISSOLVE AT ALL!If you are looking for a good soluble fiber supplement do not buy this cr@p, you should try Heather 's acacia fiber .
 I went to the dermatologist to get what I was told was a wart , frozen off . It had been there for years so the dermatologist said it might be a tough one to treat , so after freezing it she gave me this wart stick , and told me to apply it every other night and cover it with duct tape . What she did n't tell me , and what was NOT listed on the instructions on the box , was that this stuff needs to be applied exactly to only the wart , because if it gets on any of the surrounding skin , it will burn it off . I ca n't tell if the product is working because it is just burning off more skin every time I use it and I do n't think I 'm going to continue using it .
 Just made the wart white , and made the wart smaller , was not impressed . Also this stuff bruses skin so only put on your wart .
 Ok this stuff is terrible . These reviews have to be fake . Like other reviewers have noted , because the wart medicine is mixed into the chapstick like material of this stick , it makes it completely useless . Also its hard to really target just the wart since the stick is so big . You are much better off doing what I did and buying Compound W which is a gel and extremely powerful . I 'm having much better success with it . You get what you pay for .
 I purchased this product based on the overwhelming positive reviews . Maybe my stick was a dud , I do n't know but it did n't do anything . My skin had no reaction to this . I read many of the reviews and based on their instructions , I applied it in two different forms . One was direct contact with the stick -LRB- though this is kinda hard because it 's so big to the area being applied on , creating a smear on healthy skin -RRB- and the second was to use a Qtip and break off one of the soft tips and use the stick portion to gather and carefully cover the wart for a more precise application . I then covered it with a band-aid to ensure it did n't smear off or spread to healthy skin . After 24 hours of having it on , I decided to take off the band-aid and see if any reaction had taken place . I was very skeptical because I did n't feel any sting or burning sensation as with the other products which contain far less acid than this stick advertises to contain . I peeled off the band-aid and it was the same . It was like I had applied chapstick to myself and that 's it . I 'm very disappointed in this product because of the rating here and the advertised higher concentration of acid . I 'll go back to the other known brand that contains far less acid but at least it appears to do something than just lubricate my skin.Save yourself the money and get something else .
 Easy to apply over warts that are bigger than a tiny pad offered by Dr. Scholl 's however it seems that it 's absorbed by your skin without any effect . I had much much better results with a duck type . Save yourself some money and get liquid form not this vaseline texture product .
 The service was great no issues , the product just did not work for me . The package got to me just fine ; so I hate to give a bad review . It was like chapstick and it made the tip sore , but thats it , maybe I used it wrong .
 After using this product for several days on my leg the surrounding skin became incredibly inflamed , almost like a burn . It is extrememly itchy and painful , plus the wart has not gone away the slighest bit .
 After reading all the great reviews I was thinking that this stuff was really strong and going to work . I was expecting to feel a light burning sensation so I could tell that it was working . I tried using this several times and it did nothing . I do n't know if I just got a bad one because it looked like it was somewhat melted when I opened it . Too me , I felt like I was putting chapstick on a wart and hoping it would work .
 I purchased this product due to all the great reviews . I have used this on my daughters leg for several weeks and still nothing . My daughters leg looks to be rubbed raw but there has been no progress with her warts . I am very disapointed with this medicine !!!
 Bought this to remove a wart . Weeks later of apply several times a day ... minimal results.I threw it away . What a joke . I did then buy trichloroacetic acid 50 % and boom ... the wart was gone.More expensive , but cheaper than buying the `` freeze away '' over and over .
 Convenient to use , but does n't work near as well as liquid . Also it 's the size of lip gloss sticks , so hard to confine to smaller area .
 I did not see any noticable change in my warts . This product is much like chap stick and it will wipe off very easily . I found it very hard to keep on for more than a couple of hours at a time . The only good think about it is it was cheep .
 I used this for a year and a half on a wart on the underside of my big toe . All it did was kill all the healthy skin around it .
 this takes too long , you have to apply it all day and that is annoying , get the freeze spray from dr scholes
 The truth is buy regular wart remover . Used this for awhile and did not do anything . Regular wart remover is the best .
 This product must be fake because It did not work at all . Usually with that much salicylic acid , it is supposed to `` damage '' your skin and turn it white , that is how you know it is working . Used this for a couple of days with no results at all .
 I had a bunch of plantars warts on my heel that had been there for a while and just kept multiplying . I was under the impression that they had to be removed by a doctor , until I saw this product . I immediately ordered it and began using it religiously . A couple weeks passed and I did n't see a change in the warts . The skin around them was n't looking so good , but the warts were still thriving . I read online that a lot of people have luck with apple cider vinegar , so I tried that . MUCH better results . Forget this product , just go to the store and get some ACV , cotton balls and duct tape .
 I spent 3 weeks burning both the warts with wart stick . I used it to the point where it nearly started bleeding , still no result , warts still grew back . Used the freezing method , got rid it of it in one application . Much better , cleaner , and surprisingly , less painful .
 This stick is extremely dangerous . I tried it to remove a small wart from the top of my foot , and it created a major chemical burn on the skin surrounding the wart . It is incredibly painful and now I 'll probably need to have the wart surgically removed , which I was trying to avoid . I 'd rate it NO stars if I could .
 This product did not work at all on my son 's warts . I was not satisfied with it at all . I would not recommend it .
 In spite of its impressive 40 % salcylic acid content and the fact that it has no odor , after trying out PediFix Wart Stick for a couple of weeks , I found that it just does not work very well . It did not seem to do anything at all for me , probably because the active ingredient is suspended in a chapstick-like medium and not much of it actually got absorbed into the wart tissue . It is also quite difficult to `` pinpoint-apply '' the substance . Subsequently , I wound up spending a couple of extra bucks and purchased `` Compound W - Gel . '' In contrast to PediFix , it absorbs quickly into the tissue , and , because of the way the tube is designed , pinpoint accuracy of application is no longer a problem . Like PediFix , it also has no odor . Unlike PediFix , it contains only 17 % salcylic acid . Yet , the result was that it actually has substantially -LRB- 85 -90 % so far -RRB- removed the Wart in only a few days.I recommend `` Compound W - Gel '' , which is easy to apply , has no odor , and actually works !
 I bought this because of all the great reviews and I should have been putting chapstick on my wart for all the results it got me . I put this stuff on and would change the bandaid each day , after few days nothing . When I have used wart products in the past a few day in the skin is always white and eventually starts to gewp off . So either I got a dud too or those other reviews are fakes . This stuff did absolutely nothing .
 I ordered it for a wart on my knee . Although I did see it begin to work by turning the wart black , this was a very thin layer . After the thin layer turned black and fell off I began the process again . Again , -LRB- 2 weeks later -RRB- a thin layer turned black . I used this wart stick for almost 2 months before I grew sick of it 's results and went to the doctor to have it frozen off .
 Too strong to use on my dog . After trying it on me , I stopped . Too much acid . Not good . Sorry
 This product is like chapstick . It goes on so easy . It does n't damage nearby skin at all . You do n't have to be careful with it . I have been using it for a few days , that 's all . I would be amazed if it actually does anything . If it does I will come back here and say so . It seems like chapstick . So far , nothing at all .
 It 's safe , easy to use , and does n't do a thing except irritate your healthy skin the tiniest bit . It 's like putting chapstick on a wart . The positive reviewers are probably plants working for the company , based on what I 've seen from this silly product .
 THIS IS A TYPICAL &#34; BS &#34; PRODUCT ! IT DOES NOT DO ANYTHING TO CURE THE WARTS , SO I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS FOR . DO NOT BUY IT
 Does n't seem to do anything . Total waste of money . Wish I could get my money back ! Have found there is something better than this .
 Received this and rubbed it on a few skin-tags twice a day for 8 days - no change to the skin tag . No change to color , texture or size . It did absolutely nothing for my skin tags.I will try it again if I ever get a wart .
 Am giving this product only 2 stars because it did n't seem to have an effect other than irritating my skin .
 This did n't work for me . But then neither did freezing or medicated tape . So it may or may not work for you.Other than that the biggest negative is that this looks too much like chapstick . It should have been designed to look different so that children do n't apply it accidentally .
 A waste of time and money . Did n't do anything for me . Just pay an extra $ 10 and get dr. Scholls wart freezer
 I was excited to get this product but it fell short for me . It did not work on any of the treated problems .
 I have used this product for two weeks and wasted so many band aids . There is so little improvement that it is not worth buying this product . BEWARE
 I wish I could give this product no stars.I bought this stuff from a local health store and used it as directed . The product boasts a higher content of salicylic acid than other products . When I applied the product I was expecting it to burn . However , I never felt a thing . It 's does n't go on very smooth either -LRB- it 's not like lip balm -RRB- and seems to cake up . I used it for 2 months and the wart actually got a little bigger . I saw no noticeable change other than that . It was a waste of money for me . When I went back to the health store to tell the guy about the product , they had already stopped selling it because of complaints of it not working . Oh well .
 This had no impact whatsoever on my warts . I was concerned that one of my children would think it was lip balm and accidentally use it on their lips ... this did n't happen but I even if it had it certainly would n't have hurt as it seemed like wax .
 THIS PRODUCT IS CONVENIENT BUT ITS ALSO THE SAME AS ANY OTHER PRODUCT I HAVE USED . EVEN THOUGH EVERYBODY 'S BODY ACTS DIFFERENT , THIS WORKS THE SAME AS THE LIQUID FOR ME .
 I got the wart stick for my grand daughter -LRB- 11 yrs old -RRB- she has a wart on her hand and foot ! but i was afraid to give it to her or my daughter because it looks just like chap stick ! and my Grand daughter has a lot of little friends.so the stick is at the dump.there for i do n't know if it works or not .
 Make sure you read the description carefully before ordering so you 're getting what you really want . This particular pillow can not be used with heat , unlike the sinus pillow which works both hot or cold .
 I have used Bragg 's Liquid Aminos -LRB- BLA -RRB- for a couple decades now , but I 'm not so sure anymore . I have read the comments at http://www.welikeitraw.com/rawfood/2005/06/bragg_liquid_am.html -LRB- if the link is deleted , do a search for Brag Liquid Aminos at the welikeitraw dot com web site -RRB- . Glutamic Acid and MSG do naturally occur in foods , so their presence is not an indication that the product is harmful . Claims that the soybeans are broken down with hydrochloric acid and then the acid is neutralized with a base substance , like baking soda . However , BLA does not contain much sodium . So , as an experiment , I am laying off the Bragg 's for a while and using natural herbal seasonings like powdered cayenne , garlic , onion , kelp , etc. , just to see what happens .

 Just did not work for me . The ease of application is great , but it ends there . You might as well not have applied it .
 This item did not work and it just irritates your skin . You think it works because you see your skin being irritated and think that it 's the product doing its job but it does n't work . Not only was this way more expensive than the other corn sticks but it also was a waste of my money .
 It feels good after washing with it , but it has no effect on my fungi-nail at all !!! But it do feels good using it to wash .
 They claim the product `` helps relieve the discomfort of itching and dryness associated with athlete 's foot while it cleans and refreshes skin . '' I have athlete 's foot and this product has not relieved the discomfort and itching , nor has it even come close to refreshing the skin . Even though there are dozens of good reviews the product is weak and does not help . Do n't be fooled !
 This stuff does n't do anything . It 's a waste of money . Do n't be fooled like I was by the positive reviews.It 's too watery and it smells bad . It 's just bubbly tea tree oil scented soap .
 This product did nothing . You are better off with regular soap and just drying off well . Use a hair dryer if you must .
 I used this religiously until I finished the bottle . It did not help with my versicolor at all . All it really did is dry out my skin a lot .
 This soap made me break out in a rash everywhere I used it . I do not have insurance and I thought I would try to get around going to the dermatologist , but in the end it cost me more because I had to go to the doctor for the rash this soap caused and the original problem . It was $ 96 for an office visit -LRB- the dr. actually gave me a discount believe it or not -RRB- and I got 3 different kinds of meds that cost me $ 76 total . Just be careful if you use this stuff . Not sure what I had the reaction to because there 's alot of stuff in it .
 This stuff is a ripoff . I found some at a local store and bought it just to see if it amounted to anything . It does not . Go to the store and buy a 24oz bottle of cheap body wash and a 2oz vial of tea tree oil . Empty 2oz from body wash and then pour tea tree oil in . Shake well . Same thing only MUCH stronger and a fraction of the cost .
 This product made me break out really bad . Lots of people said it has a great smell to it , it smells pretty weird . . I notice no difference with using the product except that made me break out . Do n't waste ur money on it . .
 Maybe for a mild case of athlete 's foot . This does not work for severe or chronic tinea versicolor . The tee tree content is pretty high , but it 's not enough .
 My skin is extremely prone to fungal infections . As a result , I almost always have an active fungal infection . I am treating my current infection with an anti-fungal powder in combination with FungaSoap in the shower . I had really hoped that the FungaSoap would be effective in helping to eliminate my current problem as well as helping to keep future infections away . Reading all of the glowing reviews on this page led me to believe that this was a reasonable expectation , but unfortunately I am not having that experience . So far , after three weeks of use , all this product has done for me is cause a rash in a place where there was no skin problem before . At this point , I think I am going to stop using this product . I wish I had n't wasted my money on two bottles of this stuff that I will not be using again .
 Do n't waste your money.I tried this for my ringworm . Did not work at all . It could have actually made it worse.Pros : None.Cons : a -RRB- This product will dry your skinb -RRB- You may break out if you 're allergic to any of the ingredients , which may have happened to mec -RRB- It burns and stings for a quite a while after applicationd -RRB- It is watery and comes out faste -RRB- It is expensive for what you getI 'd suggest an ant-fungal topical ointment before this . Do n't be fooled by the great and perfect reviews . It is not great at all .
 I do n't like it simply because did n't help with my issue with tinea , not even a little . Was hoping it would of made some sort of difference , but after 3 months of using this , it did n't help with my issue .
 I purchased this product a year ago ; looking back , however , I believe I fell victim to such great reviews ... a little too great . Some posts goes from one month to the next . Others are posted a day apart with similar titles such as `` relief ! '' or `` immediate relief ! '' Ugh . I should have been more suspicious . Oh , and the product did nothing for my Tinea Versicolor . : -LRB-
 Be prudent . It is a dangerous concoction . The fumes can give a soar throat , swollen glands , and you might not get the smell out of your nose for a few days . It needs warning labels , and testing .
 Bought this product to help with hives and some foot issues however this stuff smell horrible kinda like something a hospital would use I could barely use it once , as for as effectiveness nothing has changed however I only used it once .
 I developed white spots on my legs after using a tanning bed . This product had GREAT reviews eliminating the appearance of these white spots . Unfortunately it did nothing for me .
 I ordered this attempting to replace a clomitrazole and betamethasone diproportionate cream I use by prescription for a rash on my leg . While enjoyable to use , it was ineffective at preventing my rash.Following this , I triedClotrimazole Anti Fungal Creamand have seen good results . It seems the betamethasone is n't necessary to keep my rash under control .
 This is a great product that works exactly as advertised . My issue here is with the seller . They list the item as 11.2 oz. , but the actual size is just 6 oz . You can get this cheaper from other vendors on Amazon .
 I bought this product after conduct research on how to help cure my mothers condition . I can say with confidence that it did not work . Maybe I need to research a different item .
 It is not antifungal . For a new , fresh , clean scentto feet , eh maybe try massage oil or a scented moisturizing powderrather than this product .
 After reading all the good reviews , I bought this product hoping it would work for me . I used it religiously for 3 months and unfortunately there was no change in my condition . I hate to give it one star because it seemed to work for so many other people , but I have to because it did n't perform as expected :-LRB- .
 This is a nice soap , nice smell . But it had absolutely no effect on toenail fungus and foot itching . I really do not understand where all the extremely positive reviews come from ...
 I have to say this one has little treatment for my Tinea Versicolor on stomach . I have used two bottles for 6 months , but it just very slightly goes better . I also used other tree oils , but still no effect . maybe it 's because mine is a little bit severe since it 's already there for like 4 yeas before I decided to treat it . But it 's no excuse . it 's should be used to treat this kind of gray skin . I 'm disappointed .
 Make sure you read the description carefully before ordering so you 're getting what you really want . This particular pillow can not be used with heat , unlike the sinus pillow which works both hot or cold .
 The product is totally inferior to what I was expecting and advertised . I returned the item and asked for a refund . Hard to find someone to communicate with satisfactorily . When finally I got the money , it was substantially less than the money I paid for ! Nobody cared to give me the explanation . All my emails went unanswered ! I am terribly dissatisfied with this product , the company , and the service .

 I was looking for an everyday body oil but this is too thick for everyday use , but o.k. for massages .
 I have been using this for months and a few days ago I have realized that my liver has been seriously damaged . Apparently this dosage is dangerously high . It 's 5 times higher than recommended dosage.I hope my pregnant wife will not have problems with the baby is born as she was using it too . Regardless I will probably sue this company and perhaps Amazon if they do n't reach out to me before that .
 PVC is a porous material , first of all . You 'll never get it disinfected or sanitized . Secondly , that paint will come off over time . Where do you think it 's going ? Third , this type of material contains phthalates , which are potentially dangerous and can cause allergic reactions in some people , phthalates have also been shown to cause cancer . Please choose something else that is NOT PVC , Jelly , Rubber , Vinyl .
 The smell was overwhelming and the color on the product was coming off after one use . I threw it away and felt like a made a mistake purchasing it . I should have listened to the other reviews .
 I wrote all of this in the &#34; packaging question &#34; but it should have been here I suppose . I need instructions . I ordered a mop from Quickie Mfg because I had a quickie mop for 5 or more years and loved it . Unfortunately , it rusted and broke . The mop I had could be rung out by pulling it through a circular ringer . This new mop looks like it should be able to do something like that , but I have n't figured out how . I 'm not very technically astute . Now , I can only use it by hand ringing it or just plopping a bunch of water on the floor . Does it have a ringer mechanism and how does it work ? If you read this , please answer me at pj654321@aol.com .
 Did not work well . Could not keep it on at night . Not too comfortable . Ca n't walk with it if need to get up in the night .
 The product is good , but it dd not work for me . No changes or improvements on my feet .
 well , I have two of these and they end up waking me up at night for discomfort . maybe its the stress on the toe be forced to a different position , but I ca n't sacrifice sleep at this expense . it is not designed to walk in .
 This product does n't really suit my narrow foot and keep slipping down . Otherwise I think it might work pretty well .
 At the beginning all was well . You can feel it helping and i would put it on every night . I didnt get it for pain or anything of the sort ... just to help minimize my bunion . Unfortunately after 2 weeks of daily use I noticed that the velcro part that tightens or loosens the regulator is beginning to come apart at the seams ... Now there are a lot of tiny strings everywhere . I wish it would have lasted longer .
 PediFix Nighttime Bunion Regulator , Left , MediumI have what one would consider a ` moderate ' type bunion . My toe is not out of alignment that much and the ` bump ' is noticeable -LRB- 5 on a scale of 1-10 -RRB- . I bought this product b/c the pain has increased to the point it will sometimes hurt to walk . -LRB- I 'm already wearing shoes with a wide toebox and have for 20 + years -RRB- . This splint seemed to work well the first couple nights but shortly thereafter it would n't stay on comfortably . The plastic separator began to uncomfortably dig into the area between my toes.If the point is to leave it on overnight to get good results , the item needs to be comfortable . This was not and I have since thrown it away .
 I was hopeful that this would be the affordable answer to the bunion problem -LRB- as opposed to surgery -RRB- , but this product made my foot more painful than it was already . I stopped using it after about a month and have had better success -LRB- or at least less pain -RRB- by wearing only comfy shoes -LRB- no heels -RRB- and swimming/bike riding instead of walking for exercise . I do n't recommend it .
 This is a TERRIBLY painful device . I 've had it for about 2 and half months . It provides good relief for bunions , as advised . In this regard , the pressuure on the bone of the big toe is light and provides pleasant relief but the pressure applied on the nail of the big toe is simply so terrible that it has caused ingrown toenails and aggravated cuticles . Putting something soft between the device and my toenail seemed to help enough to last the night but 1 . it should n't be necessary and 2 . I have n't found anything permanent to use yet without having to make another purchase for the fix . The idea behind this is great but poorly executed ; I 've only been able to stand the pain an entire night once with aid . I am currently looking into another model by Bunion Aid that will seemingly put less stress on my nail and can be worn all day thanks to a hinge . I think it could be a lot more effective though equally expensive , if so , well worth the money . I 'll review that once I 've had it a while . Hope this helps .
 As a wheelchair user , I am always looking for a bag or pouch that I can use on the sides of my chair so when I saw these , they looked like they might work . On the plus side , they attach easily over the chair arms with velcro fasteners and are sturdily made from denim . On the minus side , the pocket is not deep enough and the bag tends to hang over the wheels , getting in the way when I 'm trying to push myself around . The product description says they can be used for wheelchairs , walkers and bedrails . I think these pouches would work best on walkers . On bedrails , because of the shallow depth of the pouch , when the bed is raised to a sitting position , the contents of the pouch might fall out . It 's a good idea but I think it needs a redesign . I would recommend them only for walkers .
 I ordered a item which was clearly marked as a box of 10 , ordered 4 boxes , and only received 4 items total . Waste of time , go with a another seller who actually reads their item descriptions.Scotch-Brite 7446 Gray Stainless Pads - Box of 10
 I gave this product one star because I have n't use it yet . Hopefully , it will clean as well as it claims .
 I still have not receivied what I ordered and paid for . They claim the first shippemnt was damaged and have yet to ship a replacement . Three phone calls were not returned from them . The vendor is very slow to resolve the problem . They said it would be here last week , now it is this week . I have no confidence that they will ever deliver the product .
 I could n't find this locally and thought it was pretty pricey if ordered through Amazon . So I just followed another commenter 's suggestion and used two tablespoons of Cascade powder dishwasher detergent . It worked great . My percolator is bright and shiny .
 The contents of all the boxes were molded together ; it was impossible to pour as a powder These boxes must have sat in a warehouse for years before being shipped . I went out and purchased the same product from a local grocery store and it was perfect . The powder poured from the box like water .
 Profoot Toes Beds were n't what I expected . Could n't get them to stay on . They kept off in my shoe . They did n't protect my toes at all .
 Toe beds are too narrow for most peoples ' feet , and also too thin . Metatarsal pads are OK , but toe bed should be much thicker to cushion toes .
 I received this fountain as a gift . It worked wonderfully but the pump is so loud it overwhelms the sound of the falling water and the pre-programmed ambient tones . It developed a biofilm over all surfaces in contact with water despite weekly cleanings that were none to easy , too many small nooks and crannies for bacteria to hide .
 I bought this to replace a broken Brookstone sound machine . First off it is bigger than I anticipated and it uses water . The information presented does not state it needs water . I would n't have bought it had it said `` you must add water '' . There is no way to turn off the water part -LRB- which means you need water for the electronic sounds -RRB- It needs to be cleaned all the time -LRB- even using distilled water -RRB- . The electronic sounds do not seem as real to me as the Brookstone one did . Wave cycles too fast , etc. . For the cost of RAM these days you would think they could have a sound loop longer than a second or so . The Brookstone one was about 7 seconds for a sound loop and you had to listen carefully to hear the replete . Not bad considering I purchased the Brookstone unit in 1996 . No so with this unit .
 Absolute garbage . Pump is too loud sound is very distorted .
 I bought this after looking at the description hoping that this will be the answer for ease my neck pain . Unfortunately , It did not . I tried both Hot & cold therapy using this . Neither is effective . First , the collar does not fit properly around your neck -LRB- for an average sized person -RRB- . Second , Even after you strap the collar you can not feel the Heat/Cold that much . Then i found out that the collar is not touching the skin on the sides of the neck . Also , the heat or cold lasts only very few minutes -LRB- Max . 5 -RRB- . Overall , I 'm very disappointed . Definitely , not worth the money . My Drugstore Cold pack was much more effective .
 I 'd been taking NOW Foods Calcium Magnesium for about a year . About 6 mos ago , I started having dizzy spells , almost debilitating joint pain , rash after rash , fatigue , etc. . Not a fun way to spend your time . They thought I had Lupus at one point . The one thing that baffled all of my doctors was that my Vitamin D levels were testing pretty high ; apparently rare.Then I finally get a notification of a recall of certain lots -LRB- which I 'd been taking from -RRB- that had 30,000 - 40,000 IU 's of D3 rather than the 600 IU 's on the label . They chalk it up to a `` formula error . '' that 's a pretty huge error - check out quality control !! After a little research , my symptoms were totally consistent with Vit D toxicity . Shame on you NOW Foods , the only reason they even found this was investigating a complaint from someone who put 2 and 2 together . Wo n't trust my health to NOW Foods anymore !!
 I ordered this looking for a calcium supplement . This came with Magnesium , Zinc , Copper , and some other crap . First of all , I already take magnesium so now I CAN NOT take this or I will be super loading on magnesium . BUT the bigger issue is the inclusion of zinc . Zinc , when taken with Calcium , is NOT absorbed . This is a waste of zinc .
 I wo n't ever buy it again . I was looking for pure grade and easy to digest , but with citrate . Big mistake !
 I was so excited to get this and try it ! I am pregnant and had gone and had my legs waxed so I would n't have to contort my body to get to my legs . Then I read all the reviews and decided I could save money if I just bought this instead of waxing . Well , it did n't really work for me . I have light , thin hair on my legs and it just seemed to break them off . The ones that it actually pulled out left little dot bruises on my legs so I had to wear long pants anyhow . The hair all grew back within a few days -LRB- no better than shaving -RRB- and it left my legs really , really , really dry . I was n't any more impressed with the results of waxing , so I think I 'll just be sticking with a razor . The size is great , it did n't hurt much -LRB- but it just broke off the hairs ! -RRB- , and seemed like a great little gizmo , but it just is n't for me .
 It was not wat I was expecting ! My friend has a different model of Santinelle Norelco that I tried and loved it , but this one breaks more hair than it pluncks , the massager is useless and you have to go many times over the same area to remove all the hair .
 I am pretty old and have used Gillette blades for over 60 years , so I am a fan.I do n't know this for a fact , but it appears to me that Gillette might be lowering the quality of the Mach3 . I have used these since they first came out and they have been great . The last few times I have bought new blades they have been dull and uncomfortable to use . It seemed to get a little worse each time I bought new blades . Previously , I used to get about 15 shaves on a blade before changing . It dropped to 10 and maybe a little lower . With the latest batch , they feel dull right from the start and after 3 shaves , I could n't take any more . I tried 5 or 6 blades and they were the same.I switched to the Gillette Power Fusion blade and it is Fantastic . I could n't even feel the blade the first couple of shaves . It lasted about 15 shaves and still felt better than the Mach3 that I was talking about . I hope the Fusion blades continue to be as good as the first couple have been.I communicated with the seller and he was great . He apologized and I told him it was not his fault . He credited me with half the purchase price anyway , so he was more than helpful .
 Unfortuantely , these mediocre and overpriced blades are probably the best shave that most people will get from the mass produced blades and shaver systems . It gives a better shave than most 2 blade razors I 've tried -LRB- Excel , etc. -RRB- , and 3 blades is about the most blades that I can use on a razor and be able to get to all the nooks and crannies on my face - thus I do n't recommend the Fusion or any other razor with more than 3 blades . Here are a few other points :1 -RRB- For thicker beards , these blades will rarely last more than a few shaves before you feel the tug and pull leading to razor bumps .2 -RRB- I do give these blades credit for the flow through design allowing hair and residue to be rinsed through the blades without clogging them ; but , then again , why do you need 3 blades in a razor ? With an exceptional blade , you should only need one to cut your facial hair .3 -RRB- Another design flaw with this razor -LRB- as well as most razors -RRB- is that the `` fins '' or whatever they are called , on the bottom portion of the razor head -LRB- that supposedly `` prep '' your beard -RRB- actually scoops away the shaving cream before the blades have a chance to touch that portion of your face - so now you have 3 blades being pulled across inadaquately lubricated skin . Trust me , you need the shaving cream there when the blade scrapes across .4 -RRB- I would recommend getting a classic double edge razor . My wife has noticed a huge difference in my face and neck - no more razor burn ! I can shave everyday now . I prefer a Merkur double edge razor which can be found on Amazon or you can do a google search for `` classic shaving '' to find them for cheaper . The blades will usually run about $ 5 for a ten pack , and one of these super sharp blades last about a week for most people . Think of the cost savings and the benefit to your skin if you only gave up purchasing the ever increasingly expensive and insane multiple blade cartridges .
 I purchased the razor and blades as the double-bladed sensor was out of stock . This is the worst design Gillette has yet put forth . The 3-blade design is much too wide and clumsy . The only shaving done with this razor system was my first layer of skin .
 Very poor quality , blade feels blunt and scrapes rather than cuts . . I used a whole pack of 8 in 1 week , each blade was only good for 1 shave . Dont waste your money
 It took 12 days for the cartridges to arrive . I have been using a Mach3 since they were released . These blades look like Mach3 blades and come in a box for Mach3 replacement blades , but they must be counterfeit . I had to put my old blade back on my razor until I can go buy replacements at the local drugstore . Save your money , a single blade razor is far better than what is being peddled here
 I unfortunately bought a bunch of these as well , and even though they are packed in Gillette packaging -LRB- foil printing and all ! -RRB- ... they are not the real deal.As a longtime Mach 3 user and head shaver ... I can tell you without a doubt that these are discards or bootlegs.The `` gel strip '' is fake or poorly done and the blades are not very sharp , which resulted in me , unhappy and bleeding.I sent a pack to Gillette , waiting for their reply . Contacted seller ... no response.buyer beware .
 i accidently ordered twice and could n't cancel one of the orders . now i have 720 pills that will no longer be fresh after one year . very upset about the service !!!
 After taking Thera Tears Omega-3 supplements for 3 months straight along with the Thera Tears eye drops , there has been absolutely no change in my eye dryness or redness . I purchased after reading overwhelmingly positive reviews on multiple sites , but considering that this is nothing more than 1.2 g of fat and after noticing no effect myself , I believe this product is just another snake oil/placebo . Do n't waste your money.As far as an omega-3 supplement , you can get about the same amount of omega-3 in Now 's supplement for half the price and twice the quantity .
 Well , I 'm on my second day and I do n't think I can tolerate the fish taste , so will have to just get regular flax oil to help with my lasik induced dry eyes .
 This product was recommended by my eye doctor . Within one long uncomfortable week I discovered I can not take fish oil , that fish oil is fish oil , it 's not the quality as my doctor suggested , it 's personal intolerance to the product that contributes to fish burps , followed by intestinal distress , head aches and finally nose bleeds . Many people can tolerate fish oil products , but those of us who can not , beware !
 While I bought these given their nutritional superiority in comparison to other fish oil supplements , the odour that they emit makes them unbearable , both to the person taking the supplement as well as those unfortunate enough to be seated around the person taking the supplement for forty hours per week . After two days of taking the recommended daily dose of three pills , I smelled like what I imagine the seafood section of a grocery store would smell like if the refrigeration units were to lose power for a few days -- and as my sense of smell is pretty terrible , the fact that I could smell myself says quite a lot . I tried reducing the dosage to two pills per day for a couple more days , but no luck in stopping the stench and no seal of approval from my work neighbours . Two days after stopping use , I 'm back to my normal-smelling self , even after going back to taking Schiff MegaRed krill oil instead . While that product gives not even remotely as much bang for the buck in terms of nutrition per dose , it 's also odour-free , so no more disgusted coworkers and no more Thera Tears . Yuck .
 I purchased TheraTears for my eye discomfort from contact lense wear . I was taking 3 pills in the morning , just as directed on the label . I noticed I was getting migraines from taking the pills after the second day or so . I began to get headaches every day . After about the 5th or 6th day , I thought it could be from the TheraTears . I stopped taking them and the next day or two my headaches were gone . I have since discontinued use altogether . Unfortunately , due to the side effects , I was n't able to use the product very long to assess if it helped with my dry eye . During the short period of time I did use it , I did not see a difference . By the way , this product is not FDA approved .
 Although my Lasik procedure was a success , the experience left visibly red veins across the whites of my eyes which have not faded even after a year 's time . Based on the other reviews here I began taking this supplement at the recommended dose of 3/day hoping that it would reduce the redness in my eyes . Prior to this I had been taking a single fish oil pill/day . While the redness of my eyes did appear visibly reduced over time , I began to experience a baffling side effect where , with my mouth wide open in mid-yawn , my jaw would suddenly and unpredictably `` lock '' open . I had to push and prod the side of my jaw for minutes at a time before things would pop back into realignment and I could close my mouth . For a couple of weeks I had no idea what was happening and was about to go see a doctor before I put two and two together . I immediately ceased taking the supplement and it has n't happened since.Probably not a typical reaction bit I 'll stick to regular -LRB- low dosage -RRB- fish oil for now .
 I bought this because of the men 's health endorsement . My wife and I used it a few times and then desisted . It 's ok for intercourse but not other activities .
 This product after reading several reviews posted gave the impression that Pjur was an exceptional product . From what I have found when using Pjur is that the product dries out to soon and does not last long in the area applied . My spouse and I have used Pure Romance `` Just Like Me '' for years . Pure Romance product stays alot longer after comparing , also has more slip and wetness about it .
 We did not like this lube . It was not slick enough for our purposes and was very watery . There are much better lubes out there for the money . It also stung per my wife , so we will not try this again .
 I tried several different products . Actually , this is not good comparing to others.It 's sticky . I wo n't buy it any more .
 Hi , this is a bad product in my opinion . The best way to do this is to use a glycolic acid product like Glytone 29.5 % Ultra Heel and Elbow Cream . This will remove the unwanted dead callused skin much easier and with a better result . Just need to use some care with it 's use like everything else but it does a great job much easier .
 Based on the first week of use , I have to say I 'm disappointed . There are 2 problem areas - first , the adjustment screw for the flame does n't work right ; second , the valve for refilling the lighter with butane seems to leak badly . Maybe I 'm just not doing it right , but I 've tried to figure out a way to refill & just seem to keep getting leaks . Also , I ca n't tell how much butane is getting in - probably not much since the lighter does n't keep the flame for long .
 Based on the price , I thought I was getting 180-count . Actually received only 90-count . Re-Reviewed the order site and NO COUNT WAS MENTIONED !!!! VERY MISLEADING . WILL NEVER ORDER HERE AGAIN !
 I was really impressed with the reviews I had read and decided to give it a try . Note
 Seriously , I do n't know how anyone can use this thing . I have had tatoos , waxing , and dental fillings , and I would rather have any and all of those before I ever try this product again . It feels like an electric shock and continuous pulling of duct tape on your skin . Just awful . In the products defense , I do n't think there is a way to make this device easy to use and leg friendly -LRB- God forbid you try it anywhere else , ladies !! -RRB- . I was able to remove the hair from about 2 inches of my leg and I gave into the pain and went back to shaving . Yikes .
 I am very disappointed with this product . It barely pulled hairs on my legs . I have been using an epilady for years , so I did n't have much hair to pull . Even when it was `` on its last leg '' it pulled more hairs then the Satinelle Epilator . I sent this product back .
 This was a terrible product . I got little sores everywhere I used it . believe me , I will only use it once . Wish I had my money back .
 I bought this for my son , who has bad asthma at times . I thought I could use it to listen to his lungs , but the quality is very bad.The diaphragm is plastic , and I really have to strain my ears to hear normal breath sounds , let alone crackles or wheezing.Upon recieving it , I found that one of the tubes was bent from sitting in the box for too long . It is irreversible.Although the stethoscope looks all right and works realtively well , I do n't recommed buying it just because it 's cheap .
 First up , it 's not as big as I expected and iv not had it long but it does n't seem too durable , the slide in 's are a little too short to hold an average pen and subsequently the Velcro flap doesnt close too well over the top.It may prove its worth but I think I 'm going to end up getting something a little bigger and can hold a few pens trauma sheers alcowipes , pen light l , maybe a few meds etc.Bottom line
 The razor works just fine , as expected . The problem I had was with the seller . I was asked to rate my experience with the seller -LRB- not a product review -RRB- . I gave them one star only , because I felt the $ 11.95 USPS shipping charge for a product weighing about one pound was excessive . It was like I kicked a hornet 's nest . I received two telephone calls from the seller demanding I retract my poor review . They also sent me two e-mails instructing me how to make the retraction.This part may be hard to believe
 THIS ITEM ARRIVED USELESS . I ASKED THE SALERS TO INDICATE WHAT CAN I DO TO GET IT FIXED , BUT NEVER RECEIVED AN ANSWER .
 The screens on this product wore out very quickly and are $ 20 to replace which is almost the cost of the entire product at $ 35 . Everything else seems fine .
 This product may work well , but I 'll never know . Ours arrived with a bent shaft . The gears would grind and it would not rotate . Never even got to try it . But since you ca n't return sex toys , it was just a $ 50 loss .
 Not what I expected . Not much vibration when in use . Not worth the money . Used a few times and now found a lovely home in the city dump .
 Everyone has raved about this product however , when I inserted 3 brand new batteries in and adjusted the intensity up , it BARLEY moved at all and the rabbit ears might just as well been non-exsistent . When the product was inserted it stopped ALL together , nothing , nada , zilch !!! I am LIVID that I just threw away 50.00 on something that does not work and can not be returned and certainely wont be replaced.What a rip off.Perhaps this certian item was a `` lemon '' but I wont be throwing any more money away just to find out . Buyer Beware

 At first I thought they were comfortable -LRB- I got one for each foot -RRB- but after wearing them all day the part under my toes start to press into the bottom of my big toe and bottom of my foot . They also did not keep the top of my toe from getting red . After wearing them a few days I decided it my toes feel better without them .
 Buying this will be the worst use of your cash . This was a big mistake . does not shave well . The $ 10 battery opreated braun i had was better even though it was so old . I was too late to send it back . but I only realized how bad it was after a couple of months .
 I bought this shaver because it was cheap . I figured even if it does n't shave very well , I could at least use it as a trimmer for beard and sideburns . I was wrong . This thing does not cut hair . At all . I honestly ca n't fathom how it made it to market ; it fails completely , and I mean totally and fully , 100 % , at its intended primary function.Avoid at all costs . Do yourself a favor , spend a few more bucks , and get a rotary Norelco .
 I bought this thinking it might help with friction-based discomfort . Since coming off of birth control , I 've had dryness issues and painful sex . This product was not helpful . The feel is silky , yes , but not slick . It took a LOT of the product to get any kind of benefit , and even then it just felt weird . Afterward , it was very difficult to clean off , and left an `` after '' feel about which neither of us were pleased . I ca n't imagine wanting to be covered in it for a `` massage , '' either . I do n't see the point of this product in any respect .
 Product not as pictured . Ordered the Silicone Personal Lubricant as shown but received the Gel.The original stays slippery for a long time , enhancing the wife 's pleasure.Gel gets sticky and is a turn-off for her .
 This product was no different that Eros Original , with which we were unsatisfied . There are beter silicone-based lubes to be had . Highly recommend Wet Platinum instead . It 's superior in all regards and is of the quality I was expecting Pjur Eros Origiinal to be . The interesting thing is that a small sample of Wet Platinum arrived with the Pjur Eros order , or I would never have known about it . Wet Platinum can be found at staywetlonger dot com , among other places .
 even though is not oil , it feels like it . that might be good to an extent , but if you ca n't wash it off with water , i do n't think you want it inside you .
 I loved the feel of this lub but it left me itchy and sore after using it twice . I have used other silicone products but have never hurt afterward . Must be something new in this one .
 The toe grip , which appeared to be silicone in the ad , was actually made of hard foam . It defeated the purpose of the purchase & was n't worth the effort of returning .
 I honestly would n't recommend this product . I got no more relief from it than I would have if I bought a ball of foot cushion . The loop was too large for my toe so the cushion never stayed in place . A waste of money .
 I had high hopes for this item , but it just did n't measure up . It does not stay in place , and it feels like you are walking with a foreign object under the ball of your foot .
 I have been a loyal Beanpod customer for years . I absolutely LOVE the pomegranate scent and Earthly Embrace scent . I have purchased my pomegranate scent from 2 different places and received 2 different scents . Even though they are properly labeled , colored and the exact same size - they smell nothing of the same . I contacted Beanpod Candles and they assured me they have not changed the scent formula , but the proof is in the wax . Buyer beware . Smell your candles before you burn them and find out the return policy . I do n't know who is responsible for this but it seems no one knows what is going on and what the reason is for 2 different scents . Very disappointing . Beanpod did n't even offer to make amends for this in any way . The distributor offered to take back the ones I have not burned , as long as I pay for shipping . 4-5 25 oz candles can get pretty heavy / $ $ $ $ . Does n't make any sense to bother returning . I 'd probably get about 3 % of my money back in the end .
 The lemon citrus scent is weak compared to the other scents out there . On a brighter note , the candle itself is long-lasting .
 We love Beanpod candles and have ordered from many different companies and the last 4 do notburn like they are suppose to . The wax still remains about 1 inch around the inside of the glassand does not melt or give off the lemon smell . Are these old ? Beanpod candles are the best and we have never had a problem with these candles ? Will probably not order from this company again .
 I 've been searching high and low for a green-tea scented candle . I have found a lot of `` green tea/citrus '' and scents like that , but not just simply `` green tea '' . So when I found this one , I bought it right away . None of the other reviews I read , even negative ones , seemed to mention Beanpod candles smelling gross . So I bought it . Candles cost too much as it is , but when I spend 20 bucks and then get something like this , I 'm very disappointed.It did not smell like green tea in the slightest . The best I can come up with to describe the smell -LRB- which I could smell before even opening my package when it came in the mail -RRB- , was some cross between AXE Body Spray and campground latrine disinfectant . It stung the nostrils . Just awful . I do n't know how anyone could find this scent enjoyable , let alone claim that it smells anything like green tea .
 I purchased the Beanpod Patchouli scented candle and I am very disappointed . It has been burning for hours and there is absolutely NO fragrance emanating from it at all . Also , it seems to be burning only in the middle . I have purchased these Beanpod candles years ago from a store and always loved them , especially the Patchouli scent . The store in our area stopped selling them , I found this on-line and made the purchase . I WILL NOT be buying another Beanpod candle again . I could have gone to a discount store for a crappy candle and spent a lot less money .
 I bought this candle after I was told that these were the best smelling and stronger than yankee candles . I have to say , I can barely smell this candle at all . I am VERY disappointed in this purchase . I got the Pumpkin Pie scented one .
 This was my initial Beanpod candle purchase . The mixed reviews caused me concern , but the positive ones swayed my decision to purchase this expensive candle.I ordered the Honeysuckle scented candle . When it arrived I was immediately concerned as there was no fragrance surrounding it even though it was 75 degrees Fahrenheit.The scent of this candle is a cross between dog urine and cat urine - not ANYWHERE NEAR the sweet nectar scent of honeysuckle!Planned ` obsolescence ' is built into these candles as the wax remains circumferentially 1/2-inch on the glass . It does not melt . I will not order any Beanpod items again . I am VERY disappointed in this purchase . I agree with another reviewer , the Beanpod candles smell gross . The candles are pricey and the scent is horrid . I too burned the candle for hours thinking that the wax on the sides would melt and that maybe as it went deeper into the candle that the scent would improve , but it did not improve .
 I tried several different products . Actually , this is not good comparing to others.It 's sticky . I wo n't buy it any more .
 I bought this because of the men 's health endorsement . My wife and I used it a few times and then desisted . It 's ok for intercourse but not other activities .
 This product after reading several reviews posted gave the impression that Pjur was an exceptional product . From what I have found when using Pjur is that the product dries out to soon and does not last long in the area applied . My spouse and I have used Pure Romance `` Just Like Me '' for years . Pure Romance product stays alot longer after comparing , also has more slip and wetness about it .
 We did not like this lube . It was not slick enough for our purposes and was very watery . There are much better lubes out there for the money . It also stung per my wife , so we will not try this again .
 this razor did not work right from the time i received it . it wont cut right , leaves hair , leaves rough spots . if i would of kept the box , i would of sent it back . bad choice for me .
 The short
 It seemed like a good deal ... at the time . The main reason I got this was because the DA-307 's trimmer tends to break where the pins are , allowing the trimmer to pop out of the unit . I have two older units with the same problem , so thought a relatively inexpensive replacement would be a good try . However , after six months of use the battery pack went dead . I was able to swap the battery pack from a much older unit and my version of &#34; reconditioning &#34; now works great . One has to ask
 I ordered this item on July 27 with Amazon Prime 2 day shipping ... it is now AUg 18 and Amazon is telling me shipment will take place about Sept. 22 . Amazon ... don `` t advertise items you do not have -LRB- surely this can be tracked with a computer -RRB- and have me pay for your great prime shipping service when you don `` t have the items to begin with !
 Do n't know if I received a bad batch , but my Solaray Betaine HCl capsules have a sharp unpleasant odor . The NOW Foods Betaine HCl capsules I 've tried are odorless ; I 'm going back to those .
 I had to return my bottle , because the 1st thing I noticed when I opened it was the odor , and the capsules literally looked like they had been put in an oven and toasted ! They had a burned smell . I had been trying to take them for my digestive problems , but these were actually making me worse ! Very defective bottle . I will not be ordering them again from Vitamin Shoppe if this is what you get . I have been taking Betaine Hydrochloride for several months , and this is the first time I 've ever had a problem . I had been buying them from the local health food store , but was trying to save money getting them on Amazon .
 I have used this in the past , but they changed the formula or -LRB- country making it ? -RRB- and the gelatin capsules now smell like rancid pig hooves . I threw it away .

 this was the 2nd remington shaver -LRB- not refurbished , but brand new -RRB- we got for my husband and it 's the 2nd one to stop holding a charge before 1.5 years -LRB- warranty is 2 years - and what a pain it is to arrange to get it serviced -RRB- . we will NOT be buying a remington ever again .
 This is a great idea but they 've got it wired backwards in my opinion . Your hands have to stay under the detector for a few seconds for it to click on but if you so much as spread your fingers it detects the loss of your hands and shuts off instantly . This product would be a 5-star product if it worked the opposite where it would instantly start when your hands went under it but would take a few seconds to shut off afterwards or when it detects the hands are no longer there . That way it does n't shut off when you move your hands away for half a second . Great idea , done wrong . Had to remove mine as it 's useless the way it 's currently programmed .
 Vibratex supposedly makes the best stuff , well there must have been a miscommunication on the factory floor . The motor on this is far too weak for its intended purpose and the motor will start to burn up during use . My wife was not too happy . Very dangerous . I am sending this back to Vibratex , this needs to be pulled off the market or the correct type/strength of electric motor needs to be used .
 This product was twice the price I paid for my last vibrator and is half as effective . I would n't buy another one .
 I used NSP 5W with one of my babies and I am sure it helped with labor and delivery immensely . Our daughter was born about two weeks early , after only being on the 5W for two weeks . My midwife suggested I begin it 4 weeks before the due date . My water broke at 11 pm and she was born around 5 am . I do wish I would have thought of the fact she was born 2 weeks early where my previous children were born late , including twins born 1 day before their due date.Our next baby I also used the NSP 5W . We had been going through major stresses of one of our children having 2 open heart surgeries . I did not realize that my blood pressure was high . One of the ingredients in 5W is Black Cohosh which should not be taken with high blood pressure . Dong Quai Root can also raise BP . I did not realize how high it was . I began taking the 5W and within days I was having more `` Braxton Hicks '' so I thought . Long story short , thankfully I was in a doctor 's office when I suddenly had a placenta abruption - hemorrhaging blood everywhere . On the day I am writing this , is the birthday & deathday of our daughter who was stillborn because of the placenta abruption . I nearly died myself . An emergency c-section saved my life . Had I been at home - and not in the doctor 's waiting office right next to the hospital , I would have also died.This being said , I highly encourage any woman thinking of taking 5W to search the risks of each ingredient . I believe that you will find , as I did , that especially with the Dong Quai Root and Black Cohosh , these should not be used until you want labor to START or to get it going more . To start it weeks before is a risk . Also , absolutely know your blood pressure . Keep monitoring it.From my personal experience and knowing several other moms who have had reactions to it within days , I personally do not recommend this product or would never use again .
 Product name is misleading twice - it is not high precision because one has to get really close to the skin , even then and the hair will not be cut close to the skin . Trimming is difficult with it because hair is not captured in the nozzle and knife in a swift way as with previous tools I used .
 I wish I had my money back . This device lacks the ability to effectively trim the unsightly facial hairs I purchase it to trim .
 Even though it is described as `` large '' , it is not that big I feel . Besides , the scratchy string that linking beads is not bearable .
 Yes , I did not know you could cut yourself with an electric razor ... yes , it did happen and you have been warned .
 It 's just like any other product of its kind . I have heard their quality gone worse ever since they started manufacturing outside Japan . Looks like its true .
 looks good only !!! :-RRB- you guys have to think twice or more before buy . make sure and odor and very dry
 I 've never had any kind of allergic reaction to condoms before , but these were highly problematic . It took a couple months for , er , things to be back to normal .
 Unfortunately these can be sold by a variety of retailers and fulfilled by Amazon . I just bought some sold by ASBKC_Group , and unfortunately , these are the `` bad '' ones made in Taiwan . There goes my $ 10 gamble .
 I am not a very large individual but I would say 10-20 % of the condoms rip . That is a major concern . Be careful if you are even slightly around average sized.Also mine did not come as a variety package . It was one type of the condom in a lose envelope -LRB- which was fine with me -RRB- .
 Yes , they are super thin . However , we found them way too small . They were uncomfortable for my husband to wear and spoiled all the fun . Stay away from these if you consider yourself `` bigger . '' We 've read great reviews about these and were really dissapointed . So ... two stars .
 Yeah . That 's right ... these condoms feel A-OK as far as condoms go . And they are cheap cheap cheap ! Wonder why ? Because they break and you get pregnant . I ought to sue Crown for child support , b/c babies ai n't cheap ! -LRB- Yes , i kept the resulting baby ! -RRB- My husband and I will NEVER BUY THESE AGAIN ...
 Do n't get me wrong , these condoms make it feel as if you 're not wearing anything if there 's enough lubricant . The problem is , the second you start getting a little rough and start deep thrusting , these things break easily . I 've had them break on me three times . They are also a little tight . I threw mine away . I 'll be sticking with Trojan .
 The price of these condoms combined with the speed of the shipping are the only reasons this product received two stars . The reviews stating that these condoms feel like nothing are overexagerating . These condoms fit too snugly and feel like a raincoat . Additionally , the condoms are lightly lubricated so that if you last more than 5 minutes you have to stop and apply more lubrication . This can ruin the atmosphere and sometimes the mood . Anyways I will be keeping the last six of these condoms for emergencies and my gf and I will keep searching for the perfect condom .
 This condom has no -LRB- or too little -RRB- lubrication . The resulting friction is too high . It 's difficult to move and causes pain and potential injury .
 These were definitely too small -LRB- in terms of girth -RRB- and neither my boyfriend or I could feel a thing . They were n't lubricated very much either . I 'm really disappointed , even more so since my order was delivered 5 days late . All that time wasted for nothing .
 I ordered this product Nov. 17 and as of Dec. 10 it still has not arrived . Is this acceptable ? Not in my book .
 I made the mistake of purchasing a large quantity of these on sale instead of trying a few to see if we liked them first . Now , I 'm stuck with 97 condoms that are all but useless . Maybe we 'll have a balloon party.First of all , the packages can be difficult to gain access to . I was n't intoxicated while using these , but they are more difficult to open than our usual durex and sometimes magnums.The fit on these is tight , specifically the girth . While the material is very thin , I can feel the restriction and it is distracting . The length is average and adequate.Worst of all , these lost all lubrications in 5-10 minutes . Twice I had to apply extra lubrication -LRB- think baby powder dry -RRB- and the most recent time I just gave up and called it a night.Shipping was fairly prompt from the seller , but the questionable packaging , small fit -LRB- must have done their product testing in Asia -RRB- and extreme lack of lubrication make these the worst condom I have ever used .
 These condoms are no good . The first one I put on felt too tight and ripped while I was trying to put it on . The length is fine but not good if you have normal or above average girth .
 As has been said , they may be thin , but unless your average or smaller , they do not fit . Anyone want to buy like 245 condoms ? lol
 this condoms is a nice a chip option , but they are small to use in a person Or toy 's whit a large and width penis.For the average its ok , the material so thin and can be broke easy , take a note in that .
 This product promised a lot . Though it is very thin . . the lack of lubrication kills the advantage.Sex is all about the feel and while i understand it has less lub . . i didnt expect it to have Zero lube.It is not comfortable for the partner as well.So i wud still stick to Durex that got from Amazon - The deal is good so is the satisfaction
 I ordered same product a few years ago.However I can not order the same product anymore.As someone mentioned , they is not available anymore.The factory is moved to thailand from Japan.Then , the quality becomes worse.My wife and I can not feel anymore.Please try another one if you can .
 When i put in my order it was described as made in japan . I got my package and it is made in thailand .
 this condom gets dry very quickly . One needs extra lubricant . People who give favorable review on this condom have not tried better condoms .
 I bought these because they have been called awesome by so many people . The problem is that they are small . DO NOT get these if you have a large penis .
 Awful experience with the seller `` Green Web Inc. '' . I placed an order on Nov. 14 but never received my item . I contacted the seller on November 19 . I got a response on November 21 . They informed me that there was an `` unexpected '' delay . I contacted them again to say that I would not cancel my order if they were 100 % sure I could get my item by December 3 , almost 3 weeks after I placed the order -LRB- I am patient -RRB- . They said ok . Then , on November 28 , I received an email from Amazon confirming the item had shipped . On December 4 , as I had not received anything I contacted the seller again . They answered on Dec. 5 and explained that the item would leave their facility the same day -LRB- Dec. 5 -RRB- . What ??? They told Amazon they had shipped my item on November 28 ! Would they be liars ?? Probably . Why ? Well so you do n't cancel your order.I filed a claim w / Amazon on Dec. 5 . This seller does n't have -LRB- all ? -RRB- his products in stock and does n't communicate honestly . They lie so you do n't cancel your order . They mess around & play w / buyers . Bad ! Bad ! Very poor customer service ! They do n't contact you if you do n't contact them first ! The price is good but not worth the awful experience and all the seller 's lies . This is the reason why I gave 1 star . Please , be aware that I am not rating the product . I am rating the service and the seller -LRB- Green Web Inc. -RRB- . Find another seller if you want your items in a reasonable amount of time .
 I have ordered 20 of 12 okamoto crown condoms , the total price for the comdoms is a little over 30 dollors , but they charge me overm 90 for the shipping !! It is much more expensive than the pirce I can buy in the retails stores ! They charge the pircie as 20 different shippment but they ship me as one package -LRB- very light and small -RRB- . I thought that was one order , but they charge me as 20 orders . I guess the shipment only cost them less than 10 dollors -LRB- grand shipping by post office -RRB- , what a rib off !!
 the seller accepted payment and was n't able to deliver to APO address in UK - it 's the first time such things has happened to me - if a seller does n't deliver to APO address then they do not accept money
 My girlfriend was gon na put one on me and cut her finger with the wrapper . Blood fell on my night stick.Killed the mood man.THANKS ALOT CROWN CONDOMSquantity and price is great.used the other 59 condoms within 2 weeks : -RRB-
 Recently I bought Crown condoms . I thought this could cheep and works well but when I use with my girl friend it tore , I was really shocked because this is the first time I am seeing that condoms also tore . I suggest do n't ever try to buy this kind if cheep and useless condoms , be safe and secure yourself .
 We 've had these condoms for over a year now ... That should tell you enough about how much my wife and I like them . They really do n't help with keeping the `` sensations '' . My wife hates them and I really have to work to finish at times -LRB- and really - I 'm not typically a marthon runner when it comes to sex -RRB- . Some reviews claim these are knock offs ... I 'm lead to believe them since I 've heard great things about this brand elsewhere .
 be careful , when using this . This is super thin . It will break if your gf is not wet enough.warning !
 These condoms worked all right but the last one we used ripped around the base area , not sure if it was already broken or not but it was an unpleasant discovery . Thank god I 'm on birth control .
 I 've bought these before on Amazon through a different 3rd party seller and all 100 were perfect - normal sized , thin , and slightly lubricated . This box of them that I just bought through the `` ChubbyDickEmporium '' however , are way too short , too constricting , and not lubricated . I can not use them . Now I have to search for a new condom .
 2 out of the first 10 used broke , and I 'm not even close to well endowed . Thanks for an unreliable product and unneeded stress ...
 This condom is just average . The thin Durex offer more sensation . I am very disappointed and would likely not use the product .
 I stopped using these condoms after using about ten of them . Although they are great when they work , of the ten that I used three of them broke . I have never had another condom break on me .
 i was enthralled with this when i first got it but the ice does not last that long and the rectangles are prone to breaking . great idea but not sturdy at all .
 I got these tweezers because I was very happy with my previous tweezerman for many years -LRB- but I lost it -RRB- . When this one arrived it looked just great until I tryed doing my eyebrows . Instead of pulling the hair out , the edges are so sharp that they just pinch the hair off . It has been a great annoyance !!! Only 1 out of every three hairs actually comes out , the rest get pinched off and stay in leaving a short black stump . To even try to pull out the stump again you have to wait till it grows out a bit . Very disapointed !!!!
 The reviews were great on this products , that is why I bought it.But when received mine in the mail and tried it out , It was completely useless , I think the worst 10 Dollars I have ever spent.It would not grip any hair of mine , the quality felt very poor , I had better experiences with tweezers from Walmart.Really disappointed .
 The tweezer heads did n't align and could n't grip anything . Will probably think twice about buying tweezers before I can make sure they close correctly .
 Usually I feel safe buying Tweezerman brand . These feel like some generic knock off - they do n't work well and are super stiff to use . I had to go buy a new pair at the beauty supply !
 I do not like the slant Tweezers , they do not grip little hairs properly . Much prefer the straight tip and also the scissors type , which appear to be unobtainable at present . Not a happy chappy !
 I only had a few uses out of it and already weak ? Not worth buying . Get the original @ the store
 This tool comes wtih it 's own plastic case , which helps for carrying in purses . However , it does n't work very well . Many times it misses hairs , especially the lighter , thinner ones and it 's also not nearly as comfortable to use as a regular-sized pair of tweezers .
 It cuts or breaks hairs making them impossible to remove . I 've used the full size model for years and have been very satisfied with it . I guess that I should stick with a known winner .
 I bought these tweezers based on the awesome reviews . When I tried them , I found that they were so heavy , and the edge so sharp that it cut every eyebrow hair at the base , instead of pulling them out by the root . Make sure to pluck veryyyyy slowly , if you slip and grab a bit of you skin , you will get cut for sure . I had to run to the store to buy different tweezers .
 I was very disappointed in the product . This was a product I used for years and my last three cans were terrible . it no longer mixes well and it has a very gritty consistency . The taste too has changed , I will no long be buying Peaceful Planet Soy Protein Powder again .
 Martek Labs supposedly processes the algae with the toxic , petro-chemical based hexane . Because no residue is left , they do n't have to list it , but it 's nasty stuff . Read the Cornucopia Institute 's report on soy and see the reference to algae-based DHA . I 'm trying to find other brands that do n't use hexane .
 What amazon is showing is what it used to be and what my son used to like . Before it was very clear capsule w / 5 other ingredients you can readily identify . -LRB- sunflower oil , gelatin , glycerin , water , vita C , and vita E. I used to order 1 bottle every 2 months for my son and he used to like simple seaweed flavor . Now it has modified corn starch , glycerin , high oleic sunflower oil , purified water , CARRAGEENAN , sorbitol , ascorbyl palmitate , tocopherols , natural flavor , sunflower lecithin , and caramel . Now it has stronger odor , smaller but thicker shell , and dark brown in color from its original clear orange color . My son wo n't touch this thing anymore . I guess they changed the formula to decrease the volume and lower the cost . Time to look for another brand .
 I was disappointed with this product . It does not heat up like it says it does , and the `` massage '' was just an annoying vibration . I meant to send it back , but never got to the post office . It is still sitting in the box to return in my laundry room . I 'm not sure what I 'm going to do with it now .
 It took me longer to shave with this razor than it does to shave with a blade . I always had razor burn after using this . If you want a good shave get a safety razor .
 This shaver was defective and had to be returned to seller . I did receive full refund -LRB- minus shipping -RRB- .
 This required very minor assembly . The legs and arms needed to be attached and adjusted . The attaching was easy . Adjusting was surprising difficult . The legs did not slid easily up and down and required a lot of muscle to move . I was not only concerned that I could n't do this without help , I also worried that forcing them would break them . After achieving the assembly , I began using in the shower and found that , for me , the arms are too low . I need more of a `` push up '' to get to an upright position and this was very awkward . For someone with the ability to get upright easily this should n't be a concern . Now , however , after just a few weeks of use , one of the front legs regularly slips out of it 's adjustment and collapses.This causes the chair to pitch forward and fall over . Just great . It would be bad for an able bodied person . It 's a nightmare for anyone with weakness or impaired movement.I 'm very lucky that I was n't seriously injured . I was bruised and had to untangle myself from this thing and crawl out of the shower . Thought that , perhaps , I had failed to secure it properly . Redid the thing and tried again . Same problem . I gave it 2 stars because I felt that , if it had worked properly , it could be helpful for someone with a different physical problem . Personally , I hate it . Ended up using a cheap , stackable patio chair and it works fine .
 I bought this product thinking that , since it 's such a small amount of magnesium and there 's no calcium filler and it 's a tablet , the pills would be small . In actuality they 're huge - thin enough , but really long , so if they turn in your throat you 're in trouble . Guess I wo n't be ordering pills from Amazon anymore , at least not until they start showing pill size .
 The sizing on these does not compare to Depend . My daughter wears a small adult Depend . Ordered and ca n't use . Useless !
 The zombie flavor is just gross . The chap stuck its selfs is smooth and nice but I could n't get over the smell of this flavor .
 It does n't taste or smell like Grand Marnier I was very disappointed . I would rather have my chapstick in cherry flavor . Atleast It has a taste .
 Batteries did n't last even a 1/2 hour in my portable cd player . Package of 4 lasted me less then 1 hour playing time .
 I did not receive the Kodak batteries pictured on Amazon . Instead , I got Varta Photo Alkaline batteries made in Germany . Oh well , at least it has an expiration of June 2011 .
 The splitter does a great job at splitting the pill . However the cover of this super sharp cutter does not snap close securely . I work in home health and if I put my hand into my bag looking for something and the cap happens to be open , I could get a really nasty cut . Its not safe . A cap with a razor that sharp should be able to close and snap shut securely.Also the pill crusher part does not crush the pill to a fine powder . After screwing it on on all the way , its still not tight enough to really crush the pill to a consistency fine enough not to clog a Gtube . So I do not use that function . This device has potential to be improved into something much better .
 I originally bought this pill crusher/splitter because I needed a splitter and I thought the other features crusher/cup/storage might come in handy . Well , the splitter did n't cut my pills cleanly ... the pill crumbled horribly when cut . Also the blade was very exposed which worried me a bit since I had to hold the pill still when I started cutting . The various pieces merely snapped together -LRB- except for the crusher which screws on at the bottom -RRB- , so I would not have put a pill in the storage compartment and put the whole thing in my pocketbook for fear of it opening . I started to give it a bad review after a few unsatisfactory uses , but decided to purchase another splitter first and see if it was any better -LRB- I thought my pill was perhaps , simply `` unsplittable '' -RRB- . I purchased theApex Ultra Pill Splitter . The Apex was awesome !!! My pill is definitely `` splittable '' . Furthermore , the Apex held my pill still so I did n't have to worry about cutting my fingers because I was holding the pill still . The Apex has a safety shield over the blade when the splitter is open , and it is very easy to push the pill into the storage compartment once cut -LRB- this was not so easy with the splitter you are reviewing -RRB- . The storage compartment on the Apex only snaps closed , so you would n't leave the pill in it and through it in your purse . But overall the Apex was awesome and this one was not .
 Very sticky . Do n't buy . I 'm picky so this might work for others , but trust me there are better lubricants available .

 It is way too hard to get this stuff off after use ! If you happen to touch anything but your body , it is on there for good . The bottle itself develops a super greasy feel immediately after the first use . Go with the ID Glide water based lube instead . Millennium costs twice as much , is a total mess , and does n't feel nearly as good . My GF hates this stuff too so it was a total loss !
 Title says it all . It gets sticky fast . I would recommend Wet Platinum over this product .
 First , please realize that any review of a personal lubricant is going to be subjective because everyone has different expectations of a product like this . With that said , I do not recommend this product . I am working my way through all of the top brands of silicone-based lube in order to find the one I prefer . So far I 've tried 4 of them
 When I ordered this I was expecting B6 + B vitamins . Instead I just got B vitamins . So Im pretty unsatisfied with my purchase .
 after taking the product for 2 months , I can report absolutely no effect , either good or bad . Waste of my money .

 For the PRICE ! Needless to say that I was much disappointed about the product when I realized that the scrapper is nothing more than an embedded simple razor blade in a plastic handle . I wish manufacture of these stove would tell you that you can use one to scrape burn remaining on glass top . The pad is useless , much smaller than it looks on the packaging at amazon while a regular non-scratch scrub sponge less than $ 1 would suffice .
 This item was rusty when I got it . I got it as a gift , but obviously could n't give a rusty hammer as a gift .
 Magnesium is associated with prostate cancer , diabetics and muscle cramps . It is unlikely to get too much magnesium from food alone , but can get too much magnesium from supplements . I have an extremely healthy diet but still after few blood tests it seems that I need to increase my magnesium to avoid muscle cramp when surfing and doing other sports . I do not take any other pills or medicine for any condition at all . So ; 1 . I consume magnesium citrate not oxide . Magnesium citrate is more easily absorbed and for that reason priced higher than magnesium oxide . Magnesium citrate can be chelated , which means attached to an organic acid , such as citrate and considered more absorbable than non-chelated varieties .2 . I only purchase 100 % magnesium citrate in powder form to avoid all additives from soy to maltodextrin to artificial ingredients in producing any form of pill and identified as vegetarian additives . No need to consume vegetables in pills . Furthermore enteric coating -LRB- the outer layer of a tablet or capsule that allows it to pass through the stomach and be dissolved in the small intestine -RRB- of a magnesium compound can decrease bio-availability . Now Foods and Swanson 100 % powders are priced the same for the same amount of magnesium citrate ,3 . Fat blocks magnesium so it works fine for me since I am on a low fat , no salt diet so Instead of 400 + mg or so recommended , I only consume less than 200 mg a day with a healthy diet of sardines , sprats , salmon , avocado , almonds , nuts , sesame-flax seed , beans etc. high in magnesium and all other minerals . Almonds are the highest in magnesium and one ounce offers me 22 % of my daily requirement . I place few almonds in a cup of water every night for the next day consumption , the best snack on biking trails ,4 . Magnesium which 50 % are stored in my bones , acts as laxative and calcium increases constipation . Oxide is what is used in laxatives not citrate . Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines . Magnesium is excreted through the kidneys . So I only take it few hours after a full meal since that way it goes to muscles instead of joints ,5 . Limited amount , powder form without additives , few hours , after a full meal will insure the possibility of increasing my magnesium levels with the least amount of damage to my kidneys . Taking with food goes to the bones . Few hours after meal goes to the muscles . I take calcium powder the same time too once in a while . I never take it on regular basis and never more than one day a week since it can be addictive to the bowl movement .
 I ordered the softgel form of this pill because I can not easily swallow the regular capsules . I was horrified when I opened the bottle . They are 3 times the size of any normal pill and the daily serving size is 3 pills per day to get the 400mg dose . I will not be taking these horse pills .
 The price is good , the delivery service is good but the product should really be in capsule . The tablets are much too big to swallow and you have to take about 6 a day to feel the benefits . I have resorted to melting them in cool beverages , but image the taste !!!
 I have been taking other brands of Magnesium and they work pretty good . This one stinks . Doesnt do a thing for me . Would request a refund but takes to long .
 The description given for this product is erroneous and doesnt state the primary use of this supplement which is as a remedy for constipation.As per wikipedia -LRB- and many other sources -RRB- ; Magnesium citrate , a magnesium salt of citric acid , is a chemical agent used medicinally as a saline laxative and to completely empty the bowel prior to a major surgery or colonoscopy . It is available without a prescription , both as a generic or under the brand name Citromag or Citroma . It is also used as a magnesium supplement in pills . The magnesium content of magnesium citrate corresponds to about 11 % by mass.It is always important to correctly follow the prescribed doses ; extreme magnesium overdose can result in serious complication such as slow heart beat , low blood pressure , nausea , drowsiness , etc. . If severe enough , an overdose can even result in coma or death.However , a moderate overdose will be excreted through the kidneys , unless one suffers from serious kidney problems . - wikipediaThis product is used to clean stool from the intestines before surgery or certain bowel procedures -LRB- e.g. , colonoscopy , radiography -RRB- , usually with other products . It may also be used for relief of constipation . However , milder products -LRB- e.g. , stool softeners , bulk-forming laxatives -RRB- should be used whenever possible for constipation . -- www -LRB- dot -RRB- medicinenet -LRB- dot -RRB- com
 I expected the product to cover my ankles , but instead it was long enough to go to my knees . It was extremely stiff , uncomfortable , dificult to fasten , and my feet got wet each time I used it . I wanted a refund , e-mailed the company , but they did not bother to respond at all . So do n't expect to be treated like a person after they have gotten your money . What made matters worse , was that the elastic broke the 2nd week . I will never do business with this company again , and suggest the no one does.I needed this item so badly that I bought 2 . What a waste.They will ignore you after they have gotten your money.The product was bad , and the vendor 's Customer Service was non existant.Very unhappy NEVER to use again past customer , B CookPS . DON `` T BUY IT ! ! ! ! You will regret it.Amazon did n't help me either . Shame on them to .
 I did n't recommend this product . Its too expensive and does n't serve the purpose . I was waiting for this product for two weeks to arrive at my house , to use it after my bonion surgery and I was very disappointed it broke the first day and my both feet get wet and I end up throwing in the garbage and insteadI used garbage bags to cover my feet in the shower . I truly believe that this product should be removed from the market and I deserve my money back .
 I did not find that it helped remove toxins which is what I was hoping it would do . It did loosen the bowel .
 This is an ineffective , filler-packed , cheap substitute for Oxy-powder -LRB- sold right here on amazon -RRB- . I love oxy-powder and decided to try MagO because it was SO MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE ... BUT that 's because it 's junk -LRB- literally - mostly starch -RRB- ! Save yourself the time and hassle of having to return this -LRB- like I had to do -RRB- , and go straight for what works . And for those of you concerned about some of the poor reviews of oxy-powder , here 's more info
 I took these for a week and they did n't work for me . . I went to the bathroom ... but it was n't like what I thought it was . . jus a lil came out . .
 This tea tastes pleasant for your first 2 or 3 sips . Then it starts tasting pretty foul . I hate , hate , hate how they put Stevia into it . If I want my tea sweeter , allow me to put my own sweetener in it . Not only do they assume how sweet you want your tea , but they use Stevia which leaves an AWFUL after-taste as well as giving anything that contains it a weird , not yummy , sweet taste . I prefer my tea unsweetened as it is , but if I do choose to sweeten anything I drink , I use conventional sugars that do n't taste terrible.It does give a bit of a relaxing feel , but the Stevia really ruins it . I wish I could just take it out !
 I would not buy this particular Yogi Tea again because I hate the taste of licorice/anise . The flavor of the licorice and fennel seed is very dominant , making it a sort of sickly sweet flavor which was n't what I was hoping for with my burning throat . I think a better blend would be something with more `` heat '' like ginger , which is why I usually drink Yogi 's Cold Season instead , for the same purpose.With a sore throat , its reasonable to suffer through a yucky flavor if it makes a discernible difference but this tea did n't do that .
 After reading many reviews , I thought this would be a product worth trying , boy was I wrong . Not only did it taste disgusting and required a pinching of the nose for every sip , it did n't bring me any feelings of relaxation or stress relief . I even tried two tea bags and nothing . I followed all steeping and heating instructions and still nothing . It was gross and I would n't recommend it to anyone else .
 On an empty stomach , in a controlled environment , with plenty of water , I felt no physical change to stress levels , at least not the way that you feel an immediate sense of relaxation from Xanax . Like homeopathic medicince -LRB- highly diluted -RRB- , this product is bunk.But it tastes good , and maybe it could have a little placebo effect .
 I had been having problems sleeping , and i saw this particular tea advertised in a magazine , ordered it right away online from the supplier , good price and fast shipping . No problem with the supplier at all . The tea does make one sleepy , but the overwhelming taste of licorice makes it hard to drink , and in reading the ingredients i see that licorice root is the first ingredient .
 I tried this tea because I am an insomniac , and wanted something to help put me to sleep . Unfortunately , I can barely palette this tea because of its wretched last note and after-taste of Stevia . I have never tasted Stevia before , but after reading the other reviews I instantly knew that was the issue . It goes into my throat and just tastes disgustingly sweet . Not in a good way , either.I do n't usually put sugar or milk in any of my tea -- I am one of those people who drinks strong black chais straight up . So this is a complete killer for me . If you like super sweet teas , this may be for you , but I do n't understand why they would put a sweetener in their tea . If they 're going to do that , perhaps they should make a separate version without the Stevia.I wo n't be purchasing this again , and I continue my hunt for very strong sleepytime teas that are n't sweet , fruity , or minty .
 Tea helps relaxation when not boiled , try boiling water and putting two iced cubes in water before steeping . Otherwise , the kavalactones are killed by the heat.This tea has awful stevia sweetener . Maybe I 'm not just not used to it , but I do n't like it . I do n't want the tea maker deciding how sweet my tea should be , especially with this trash stevia .
 I dont really know how good they work because they expire in only a month !!! I wasnt going to use theese untill later on this summer ! How can a product like this expirse only in 2 months !!
 These were way too strong for my teeth . I used them as directed and towards the end less than directed . They gave me long term pain in my teeth -LRB- about a years worth -RRB- .
 If you have crooked teeth like me - be alert - it really does n't work because the strips wo n't stay on the whole 1/2 hour .
 I had high hopes for these , but after using them I could n't see the slightest difference and neither could my husband . : -LRB-
 I was very excited to try this product . After just 1 day I had terrible pain but as the directions say to do , I stuck with it . For about 2 weeks afterwards I still had a tremendous amount of pain . And the product did n't work . I called the manufacturer to get my money back and found out that they no longer make this product and that it was actually expired . Thanks Amazon .
 I bought this product because I 'm a coffee drinker and I wanted to get rid of some minor staining . I have never had sensitive teeth in my life , so I was n't worried about the warning of possible sensitivity . At first I tried wearing the upper and lower strips at the same time , but it was difficult . They do n't stay in place very well so it made me afraid to swallow , as they kept sliding around , but the whitening solution made me salivate so I had to keep a napkin nearby to dab at the drool . I then went to using the upper and lower strips separately , which was more comfortable -LRB- and no drool -RRB- but time-consuming . It meant an hour at a time of whitening , twice a day . After a few days I developed sensitivity in my teeth that I had never previously known , ever . Just breathing with my mouth open made me wince . I started using it only once every few days , instead of twice a day . In the end I stopped using it because it caused me too much discomfort . It did , however , whiten my teeth a couple shades and I did n't finish the box -LRB- probably used 2/3 of the strips -RRB- . I would not recommend using this product , however , unless you are willing to undergo considerable pain in your teeth for a whiter smile . Like most whitening products it will cause temporary stripes or even slight transparency in your teeth for a week or so .
 This product is so different than the tv says . The strips are really hard to put on , and they only cover a 8 teeth , when 10 teeth show when you smile . So unless you put the excess stips on the rest , you have some white , and some yellow teeth when you smile . The strips are hard to keep on for 20 minutes , and the product tastes gross.I paid 40 bucks for these , and half are still in the box . I went out and bought the 20 dollar Rembrant set with the gel and trays and it works so much better . The gel stays on the teeth and tastes like a pleasant toothpaste . It whitens and the trays are easy to keep in . I will throw-out the Crest strips , if I ca n't give them away ... do not use them !
 I 'm 19 and tried Crest Whitestrips Premium expecting great results . After finishing one box and using it correctly , my teeth were maybe half a shade whiter . Since Crest will send a free box to anyone who is unhappy with their results -LRB- awesome offer -RRB- , I requested a box and it arrived within three weeks . I used the second box and it whitened my teeth maybe another half a shade . Overall my teeth are basically the same shade . I was hoping that the Whitestrips would actually whiten my teeth , but they are still yellow ! They are also a little hard to keep on , but it gets easier with each use .
 Ca n't really judge how well they work becuase they keep sliding around on my teeth . Within a few miinutes on putting them on they 're sliding and I have n't been able to keep them on my teeth more than about 10 minutes .
 I used the white strips once , but did n't even finish the package because they 're such a hassle . I found that after a while the strips simply stop adhering to my teeth and I literally ca n't keep them in place inside my mouth for the recommended time - they end up wadding up like plastic wrap . Since I had braces , my teeth are very straight , so I switched to Aquafresh white trays , which worked out much better for me as they are VERY easy to keep in place .
 not all that , i somewhat think that i saw a change in my teeth but i think it was my imagination lol . it was annoying trying to adjust them & whatnot . its best to do the upgrade . well at least i like the taste lol .
 This product may be very effective when used correctly , but I can not recommend it simply because it is nearly impossible to use correctly . I had previously used a generic store brand and had hoped to achieve better results with these . After the first day , I can tell that the whitening effect is stronger ; however , the overall result is probably diminished by the difficulty of usage.Some tips I learned the hard way : - Do n't believe that you can just throw them on and do something else . I spent the entire time they were on in front of the mirror adjusting and dealing with saliva . Paper towel is almost a necessity . I ca n't help but think that those who just quickly apply them and do other things will end up with uneven results.-Don ' t rip the pouches open , use scissors . Ripping them will pull on the backing , and wrinkle up the strips before you can use them.-Immediately after placing the strip , wipe your fingers off before adjusting the strips . Adjusting could take a while , and your fingertips will turn white from the gel.I really think Crest could do a better job of making these strips easy to use . Some rigidity to the strips would do wonders . The backing should be a different material and the strips should be precut , something more like bandages would be nice . Also , why not make the lower strips as wide as the top ? The material is there , they just cut a smaller strip out ... I may end up with whiter teeth , but next time I 'm using the old-fashioned tray and gel .
 these strips do n't whiten your teeth AT ALL , even if they did the bottom strip only covers 6 teeth so you would look stupid with both white and yellow teeth when you smile . You should use trays and gel , it gives you great results and dose n't cost half as much as these strips ... stay away !!!!
 I 'm a coffee/tea drinker ; I bought the stripes to try to combat some yellowness from that . I was n't expecting supermodel teeth -- just a noticeable improvement . The bottom line is that they did n't work . I can think of a million things I wish I 'd bought with the money instead.I also experienced the tooth sensitivity that other reviewers have described . It has been 3 days since I stopped using them , and my gums still do not feel right . I can not believe this is truly a safe product for repeated use.In addition , I am a small person with small teeth . The stripes barely covered enough teeth for me .
 I opened up the crest strips to `` NO AVAIL '' it was completly empty with the instructions I am asking for a refund I will let you know what happens . . It can be an honest mistake lets see when they refund me
 These do NOT whiten teeth . I 've tried them and the commercials are deceiving . You will NOT get the results they show on the commercials . I was very disappointed in this product.Save the money from these and go to the dentist and have a professional zoom whitening . There is no way you are going to whiten your teeth at home using these . The peroxide is n't strong enough . The dentist uses over twice the strength of these . I do n't care how many packages of these you use , it will not work.Also ... The bottom strips are too small to cover your teeth and they float off in your saliva . You 're basically ingesting peroxide from them . I do n't know how safe that could be , but it 's not very promising to me . The dentist will cost more , but it will be what you are really expecting . Save your money .
 These white strips did n't do a darn thing for me , not even a tiny bit whiter . What really galls me is the `` guarantee or your money back '' . I sent in my receipt along with the bar code , just as instructed , and never received anything back - this was 5 months ago .
 After the first application I felt a little soreness on the area where I applied the strips . This morning I did the second application and now my teeth are in terrible , distracting pain . I would not recommend this product for anyone with sensitive teeth .
 These things are way too tight . They did n't tear when I put them on , so they 're pretty durable . Too bad I could n't keep it on long enough to give it a proper test.I 'm sticking with the Helmet XLs from now on . Too bad Amazon does n't carry them .
 I am an amputee and rely on crutches to move around . My old crutches were broken and were dangerous for me to use when I ordered these . When I got the crutches I found them broken . The part that goes under your arms was not connected on either crutch . When I attempted to use them the tops would come off and I would loose my balance . Out of necessity I was forced to glue them on until I can find a new set of crutches . I am very dissatisfied with this product and would not buy this item in the future.Item
 It warms like it says it will but between applying it and such , the warmth caused it to not be as slick as I needed it to be .
 It 's a $ 17 pair of tweezers , so what makes them so special?THEY 'RE STAINLESS STEEL !!! oooh wow , im so ordering this .
 In the literature it always states that it is extremely rare for people to experience side effects . However , I do NOT think this is the case if you are very sensitive to medications . If you are , you will want to take a much lower dose of this potent herb . The recommended dose threw me into a detox that was utterly miserable and lasted for weeks . It took me a while to put two and two together as I just thought I was sick . The same day I stopped taking this product , my symptoms went away .
 After first time worn it turned color . It is too thick and cumbersome to wear as a toe ring . Very poor deign .
 gold colour came off within 3 days , then silver colour in a couple more days which then left the copper . this then turned finger black all within a week.New Spiral Twister Magnetic Band Fits Ring Size 7 & up
 If you read the description closely of the Gillette Fusion product as put out by Gillette , you will see that Gillette does n't actually claim that you get a closer or even better shave . They very cleverly use terms like `` a better way to shave '' or `` 30 % closer blades '' , and there is a reason for this . The reality is that very little -LRB- if any -RRB- improvement in the actual shave itself has been made since the 3-blade systems . And Gillette knows this through their own internal research . Their studies show that customers ca n't discern the difference between 3-blade and Fusion systems . It is all just perception . However , Gillette with these newer hyped blade systems is able to charge a lot more for the replacement blades and reap higher profit margins than the older blade systems . The reason I know is that I have a cousin high up in one of these companies.Here is another interesting tidbit you probably did n't know about all of this . Have you ever wondered why the original blade that came on the actual razor you purchased seemed to last much longer than any of the replacements . Well there is a reason for this too . The blades that go with the razor packages actually come from a different stock , which are made much sharper to give a better shave and last much longer . Gillette does n't want folks to get a bad first impression . As you probably know , they do n't make money on the razors . The real money is with the replacement blades . And the blade stock used on the replacement blades is inferior and much duller to get folks to replace them faster.With the significant price difference between the older 3-blade systems and newer ones like Fusion , folks really are better off saving their money and sticking with the older systems .
 Last year I received a free Fusion handle and blade in the mail from Gillette . Tried it and got the smoothest shave I 've ever had . I immediately decided to switch from an older system that I had been using for years.That sample Fusion blade lasted about 3 months -LRB- I kid you not -RRB- and I do have a heavy beard . Wow , I thought . These blades are expensive , but if I did n't have to change them as often , it would actually cost less than I was paying for the Sensor refills . The great shaves I got from the Fusion really sold me on the product.I purchased my first 4 pack locally and replaced the sample blade after it finally wore out . What the heck ? After about a week the replacement blade was dull . I went through the 4 pack in about a month and bought a second pack at another retailer . Same thing . One week = 1 blade.Gillette must really think we 're stupid . Give the suckers a free sample that 's great and make them pay for crummy blades after they 've committed to the system . Never again , Gillette ... I just ordered a Braun cordless from Amazon so you can just go pick someones else 's pocket.Edited
 The comapny claims these cartiriges are brand new in original box . However , my experience shows the following :1 . The cartirges arrived in an opened package which had labels , probably from a retail store , removed from its back . It was obvious that this `` original box '' was previously used2 . After using the first blade it felt like I am shaving with sand paper . It was a counterfeit . The top blue layer with soothing gel felt like rubber .3 . I went to Target and bought true original blades to compare . The experience with the original blades was smooth and nice shaving .
 I bought these blades and was overcharged on shipping by $ 28.00 US If you check the fraud pictures posted on the internet these fall under the fake category.I bought these for friends and family and i get responses that these blades do not stay sharp . The blue glide strip does not wear like normal ones . No serial numbers , Indent on outside of cartridge that signifies fake blade the metal clip holders not bent down to hold blades secure to cartridge again are being sold as fake.Just not the same shave as authentic blades should be.Not happy with purchase
 These blades are not genuine Gillette blades . Comparing these blades to actual Gillette brand ones I bought at the store , these blades have a fake `` indicator strip . '' Blades wear out long before genuine Gillette ones do . The plastic molding of the blade is different than the real thing . The packaging is much cheaper than actual Gillette packaging . I would not recommend these unless you 're looking for a fake gillette version blade .
 This razor gives a good shave , but , it is really not that much better than the M3 or even the the Sensor . It certainly is not worth the outrageous price Gillette is charging for refill blades . Twice as much as M3 and 3 times as much as Sensor . $ 28.00 for 8 blades ? Ridiculous !!
 I ordered these replacement cartridges and the blades were dull . The first shave was like a blade that I should have discarded . I tried another one , same thing . The price was right , but the shave would have been better with a dull steak knife ...
 The replacement blades , which cost big money , definitely last very little time before they become dull . I thought I was the only one who noticed this and switched to a Braun electric razor but if you read the other reviews you 'll see that other men have done this as well.I got the Braun Series 7 - 790cc -LRB- 9595 -RRB- Pulsonic Shaver for $ 199.99 about a year ago , and periodically -LRB- right now for example -RRB- you can get $ 50.00 in gift certificates with the purchase of any Braun electric razor that is over $ 130.00 . So I got an amazing razor , the best they make for $ 150.00 since I 'm def going to be using the gift certificates for stuff I need . I no longer have to buy a new pack of blades every 4 weeks -LRB- only have to replace the blade set once a year now for $ 25.00 -RRB- and no shave cream -LRB- have to buy a few cleaning and lubrication packs though for about $ 40.00 for a years worth -RRB- and I never get irritated skin anymore.So now I spent $ 150.00 + $ 25.00 + $ 50.00 = $ 225.00 for the first year and a half I 've used this razor instead of $ 25.00 x 18 months -LRB- what I had been paying every 4 weeks for blades -RRB- + $ 100.00 -LRB- 18 months of shave cream -RRB- + $ 15 for stupid razor handle-thing = $ 565.00 So Gillette Fusion , or comparable manual razors , cost roughly 2.5 times what it cost me to operate the best Braun electric razor . Most men might not change their blades as often as I did but the things got dull so quick I do n't see how it could be avoided .
 The good news with this razor is that the single blade on the reverse makes a neat job of sideburns and mustache area for men . Unfortunately , this is the only improvement over the Mach3 . It also delivers an inferior shave compared to its predecessors.Despite the introduction of the Phantom version , which gives men a more palatable black over the original orange , the shave it gives is still an inferior one .
 I first tried the fusion power razor , I thought it was great ! But hold on I purchased the replacement blades and WOW ! They were terrible !!! they seemed really dull BEFORE I used them . I do n't know if Gillette is using the ole bait n switch or what , But my first blade lasted about 3 months and gave a great shave . The replacements are garbage , do n't waste your money . Just my opinion .
 I 've used fusion blades for quite awhile , but these definitely were not as smooth/sharp as usual . They 're mostly usable , but not as comfortable as normal . -LRB- I threw one away immediately . -RRB- I emailed the seller inquiring , but they did not reply .
 Hey guys , I originally bought a Fusion power when it came out and used it for a week - I decided I did n't like it as much as my M3 Power and put it aside . The blades felt like they were scraping too closely against my skin and I found it to be an overall fairly uncomfortable shaving experience , without getting noticeably closer than the M3 Power.A year or so later , my M3 Power stopped working , so I ran out to the store and picked up some normal Fusion replacement cartridges -LRB- not Fusion Power ! -RRB- instead of buying a new razor altogether . The experience was completely different from what I remembered ! The razor just glided over my skin , I never felt like I had to go back over areas , it was incredibly comfortable , and , most importantly , an extremely close shave!Surprised , I wondered what it could be , and realized that it might be the blades making the difference . I picked up some Fusion Power replacements and tried them side by side and it confirmed for me - the Fusion Power blades are markedly worse than the regular Fusion blades.Don ' t believe me ? Give it a shot yourself , I think you 'll find that the best combo is to buy a Fusion Power razor and regular Fusion blades.Good luck !
 I BUY THESE BLADES FOR MY HUSBAND ABOUT ONCE A MONTH . WE HAVE NEVER HAD AN ISSUE BEFORE . I SEARCHED AND FOUND SOME THAT WERE CHEAPER ON AMAZON THOUGH A WHOLESALER , ALL THE TIME WHOLESALE . THEY WERE 17.99 +4.59 SHIPPING . HE GOT THEM A WEEK LATER . THE FIST TIME HE USED THEM HE HAD CUTS ALL OVER HIS FACE , HE STILL HAD SHORT HAIRS THAT HAD NOT BEEN SHAVED OFF AS THE BLADE WAS VERY DULL , AND HIS FACE WAS BURNING . ON THE BACK OF THE BLADE THE ORANGE STRIP HAD BEEN WORN OFF JUST FROM ONE SHAVE . THESE ARE DEFINATLY KNOCK OFFS . WE COMPARED THEM FROM ONES WE ORDERED BEFORE AND THEY DO NOT LOOK THE SAME . I USED ONE OF THE BLADES TO SEE IF MY HUSBAND WAS RIGHT , AND IT WAS HORRIBLE . I GOT RASOR BURN AND STILL HAD LITTLE HAIRS THAT WERE NOT REMOVED AS THE BLADE WAS SO DULL . WE WILL NEVER PURCHASE BLADES FROM ALL THE TIME WHOLE SALE AGAIN , OR EVEN AMAZON IF THEY CONTINUE DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM .
 The love of my life has always used this brand of shaver and when this newer model came out we bought it for an upgrade . While it does shave close , for the first time ever my loves skin is ripped and cut up every single time . So you need to think hard before this upgrade . The model just before this new one worked very well .
 Three months ago , I bought 48 Gillette Fusion Power refills -LRB- quite an investment -RRB- , and placed them on my bathroom drawer , and to my surprise , last week I went to replace a cartridge , and found that ALL , literally all , were completely rusted ! It 's a a shock , and all Mach 3 I had there for longer than that were just like new.How can P&G ; can explain that ??
 They kept me waiting all this time saying the that they were out of stock and now they cancelled my order . It was false advertising and I would never buy from them again .
 This product looked good for the price . Too good infact , think it was a knockoff . Do n't waste your money .
 This razor system does not give a close enough shave for me . The single blade on the back that is for sideburns and under the nose area does not seem to work at all . They may advertise the Fusion as having the closest shave you can get , but this was certainly not the case for me and I do n't think its the case for most people . Also , when I used it my skin became more irritated than it normally does with shaving . I now use the Norelco 8150XL electric shaver exclusively and it works like a charm every time .
 I ordered this on 09/23/2009 and it is now almost the end of october ... I have been had.I love how they take your money and never give you what you pay for . If this is fair then I dont know what fair is . DONT ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE EVER !!! THIS IS THE ONLY TIME I HAVE EVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH AMAZON.COM . They do a great job and it 's sad that this happened.I am not doing business with AMAZON again .
 I purchased blades from Amazon before but these blades seem to.be very old and scratch the faceI will not purchase again
 Just opened and tried the first blade . I have been using Fusion Blades since they have been on the market and my face told me with the first stroke that the blades were counterfeit . A convenience store cheapo throw-away blade is a lot sharper . A few years ago I was given a web page that I could buy this type blade at a discount price . They too were counterfeit . I realise that you have to be skeptical when buying on the internet , but I trusted Amazon to have checked their vendors out . What is most aggravating is there was no deal in the price . I could have went to the nearest Walmart and bought for the same price when adding the cost of fuel for the round trip ...
 I bought the Fusion Power because I am a huge Federer fan and he endorsed this product so I thought why the heck not !! I have a pretty sensitive skin and I thought that this product would work out great for me . I was right . I absolutely loved the product which is why I ordered this replacement cartridges pack from amazon . For some reason though , these blades feel different , and not in a good way . Compared to the blade that came with the razor , these blades are really bad . I still found a way to make these blades work slightly better for me , but I was and am really disappointed . Maybe I got the bad ones or something , but do not buy this pack expecting it to work the same way as the one that came with the razor ...
 I had lost my Mach 3 Turbo , so I decided upgrading to new Gillette Fusion Power with 5 blades . I got thick and hard hairs . These five blades are too close to each other creating a very rough experience like ripping out my hairs and shaving my skin . Tried few times , but kept regretting . Finally , ended by buy Mach 3 Turbo .
 I am currently talking to the people over at Gillette over the concern that this product listed on Amazon may be counterfeit . The razors are not shaving smoothly , they are very very rough and tear up my face . Now when I have purchased this same product from places like cvs , walmart and target ; they shave so smoothly and gently . Also the packaging looks off . I will not be buying again from Amazon if they are allowing counterfeit goods on their site .
 The product was received on time but the Gillete blades are not real . They are fake . I am not able to use them , they hurt so much . the blades are not sharp and not aligned properly . they do n't have the serial number as the real Gillette blades have . I 'll never buy anything from this retailer .
 Wow 5 blades instead of three ? Who would have thought of that ? I smell noble price here!Don ' t let the great cosmetic design fool you . It turned out to be the same thing but with more blades.I was really excited waiting for my brand new Fusion Power razor to arrive , I am allergic to shaving so this was a big issue for me . After the first shave my hopes were destroyed . It turned out to be about the same thing . They even mentioned the blades being closer as an improvement , when in fact , I think they were forced to do it that way because if not they would have ended up with a huge cartridge that would not fit the contours of the face . The only obvious new feature is the trimmer , which is only that , a feature , and not a real technical advance.I hope that someday these companies start to invest a part of the income they get from the overpriced cartridges in research and development , instead of investing it in marketing.By the way , my power handle came broken , so I could n't test this feature , although I have had power handles in the past with other blades and the difference was minimal.What will be next , let me guess , 7 blades ? I guess that these guys should really start working in something new because the `` adding more blades '' thing is getting exhausted .
 These are the best blades you can buy . I usually get two months of shaves out of one blade ! Bought some here from Hotdealz and went through 8 blades in 5 weeks . After reading some of Hotdealz responses to negative reviews , I saw they get a little touchy when someone cries `` counterfeit '' . I 'll refrain from that here . You decide
 After trying to save money on blades by buying them off of Amazon and getting obvious counterfeits ... going to war with the reseller ... getting slapped around and retaliated against by the reseller , buyers should know you are running a likely risk buying razor blades from anywhere besides a retail store . I contacted Proctor and Gamble about the counterfeits I received and here is their response.Richard , We appreciate your bringing this to our attention . P&G ; does n't distribute our products through Amazon . If you have questions about the authenticity of the product you purchased , please contact Amazon . In the meantime , I 'm sharing your message with our Security Team.The safest , most reliable way to purchase our products is through retail stores . -LSB- ... -RSB- Judging by the mixed reviews , some people may get real blades and some may not . In any case , if you get fake ones you have to pay the postage to return them to get your refund so you will lose time and money if you come up with the counterfeits . Also consider that you may get reasonably good counterfeits -LRB- though doubtful -RRB- which still is n't giving you the actual product 's quality experience . Because I had to return the blades to the reseller I was unable to send them to Proctor and Gamble for their security team to research . All I 'm saying is , it 's a gamble to save a few dollars . I will never buy blades again from an online seller .
 These are not the real ones you buy at the store . I bought the exact same package from walgreens and the blades felt completely different .
 the blades are only copies i had a terrible time trying to shave with them
 A rep-off !!! you pay a lot of money to get a bad quality blades . I have tried all the products Gillette produces and unfortunately they all are bad quality so expensive blades . Eventually , I went old school , safety razors are the best you 'll every get . try it and you 'll say GOD how did n't know about these razors !
 This pack of cartridges must have been laying around in the back yard for sometime . Used all eight in two day 's trying to find a good one , cut my face each time I tried a different cartridge . I guess this is one item you do n't buy from an online retailer .
 I could n't even bring myself to give this gift it was so pathetically junky . It should have been $ 5 .
 if u read the supplement carefully , u will find that 500mg means 2 pills , which means 1 pill only contain 250mg L-carnitine . It is not worth it , not that `` cheap '' , just use the topic to cheat u to buy it
 My bottle of L-Carnitine 500 just arrived . 90 capsules . Here is the statement on daily dosage
 I saw no results from this product.I dont really like trying to take something an hour before a meal . Busy people dont have time to watch the clock before eating .
 Saw this product advertised as a useful weightloss aid , supported by a report on the Dr Oz TV show . However , after two weeks of using this product , I found no benefit whatsoever . I will continue until the capsules have all been taken , although I think it 's just another scam in the mega-million dollar ` weightloss ' industry . I would suggest you do not waste your money on this product -LRB- although it was inexpensive -RRB- .
 This seemed to give little or no benefit . I switched to NOW brand Acetyl-L Carnitine . I really did notice a difference . I would suggest doing a Google search .
 I regret ordering these as a box in the Gillette container was only a few bucks more . From normal packaging I get 30-45 shaves before the razor begins to scratch my face . These...2-3 shaves . Yeah . The lubricating strip at the top disappears after 2-3 shaves too . Really , sorry I bought these . I 'll switch back to buying the razors in the Gillette packaging for next time . 8 razors from Gillette has in the past lasted me close to a year , not 12 weeks .
 Please be aware that these blades are not official Gillette blades and that they will only last for one week each before they are blunt . Overall , since the official Gillette blades last for a month , we are all better off financially bying the official ones in a standard shop . My 2 cents .
 I am not sure what it is , but these blades seem to wear out faster than the ones I buy from grocery stores . I thought I 'd get some genuinely good blades since they were in these ` factory packs ' , but I guess they are not . I will going back to buying from the store and when someone does come with a better blade , I will drop Gilette altogether
 Razor blades are expensive enough as it is , and the trend of `` more is better '' has reached almost ludicrous points in the industry . What 's that ? Five blades , you say ? Why , it must be better than four ! Meh.I have fine stubble which grows in at varying angles across my neck . The good news is that , while other razors have always been unable to remove all of my stubble on the first try , this blade does , in fact , take care of the problem . In addition to this , it aggravated the skin quite a bit -LRB- this might have as much to do with the vibrating action as with the five blades -RRB- . The precious soothing-aloe strip had little to no effect on my skin -LRB- particularly in the neck area -RRB- . If you have sensitive skin at all , this might not be the razor for you.Contrary to the experience of others , however , the extra `` trimming '' blade worked well for me when getting the spots along the edge of my mouth , under my nose , and when shaping my vast hedge-like sideburns.However , the five blades on the other side dulled remarkably fast . Considering my rather fine hairs , I 'm used to exchanging blades once every week or so . Now I 'm exchanging them twice a week . Seeing as how this product is already so much more expensive than competitors ' products , and seeing as how it is designed to work exclusively with the Fusion razor -LRB- and vice versa -RRB- , and seeing as how its lavish wealth of cutting action has clawed at my skin , I find it hard to recommend .
 Amazon used to carry good deals on these 12-packs . No more . It is now less expensive to buy these at Walmart . Also , I would echo the concerns voiced by others that the quality of these blades are n't up to snuff with the store-boughts .
 I bought the Fusion manual razor and after using the two included cartridges and then seeing the cost of replacement cartridges , I have tossed my Fusion . Replacement Fusion cartridges are much too expensive and the shave one gets from them simply does not justify this kind of expense . I think the pricing of Fusion cartridges is like that of gasoline
 I am not sure these blades that get sold in Amazon -LRB- or Walmart and Safeway for that matter -RRB- are authentic . Or they are a inferior quality . I have found the same blades at Kroger to be great or ones that come packaged with a promotional body wash etc -LRB- those are likely authentic -RRB- . I am not sure what the deal is , but there is something fishy !
 Did not received the product , so I can not provide a review ! Can not rate the item either , but had to select something ?
 This situation goes back to September 2010 !! THIS PURCHASE DEMANDS A SUBZERO PRODUCT RATING.The 12 Gillette Fusion Blades were copies not made by Gillette . DULL AS A HOE !! When I contacted Amazon I was told that the money that I paid would be refunded and a new cartridge of GILLETTE blades would be sent . -LRB- Email Documentation is available . . -RRB- As of this date none of the promises has been met.Be careful about your purchases !!! I 'm through with Amazon . -- Don --
 These razors are entirely too much money to be this bad . They are dull and scratch the skin ... all of them did . The Mach III 's I got from Costco were way better . Not going to buy these again .
 uSED THE MACH 3 FOR YEARS , SWITCH UP THE M5 BLADE ... WORST MISTAKE . . OVER ENGINEERED THE BLADEDS CLOG UP ... DO NOT BUY
 They are constantly looking for new ways to increase the cost of shaving . All they can do is add more blades . From one to two to three to four to five blades . What is next ? I would imagine a 6 or 7 blade shaver . Then 10 or 12 . It is utterly absurd . Save your money . You can get a nice close shave using a one blade , cheap disposable shaver . Just take your time and be careful . You 'll save hundreds of dollars , though .
 I had a Fusion handle and blade sent to me by the Gillette company to try . I have to say that I am thankful I did n't pay the premium cost they are asking for this product . It was the most uncomfortable shave I 've ever had next to dry-shaving . The idea of the single blade on the reverse side for `` precision '' is only useful because the five blade side is so bulky it ca n't be manipulated well enough to give a clean line for sideburns or under the nose.Immediately after my shave I had a five o'clock shadow , which was promptly cleaned up by shaving AGAIN with my Mach 3 . What 's next from Gillette ? 20 blades to remove the first layer of skin and gouge out the hair folicle ? Perhaps reshape your jaw bone to give you that `` Executive Look '' ?
 They came in a package that was not sealed . I find this unacceptable and dangerous . I am not even going to try them
 These Razors must be factory seconds . It was painful to use the blades . They were course and hurt my face . I did not get a clean Gillette Shave . Felt like old blades I would have thrown out , but they did have new green ruber indicator strips . I ended up throwing them away . Not the usual Fusion Experience . I tried to order these online because I thought I could save a few bucks . I might still try ordering them from amazon , but never again from these guys .
 I bought theses with the hopes of saving some cash and for my surprise it turned out that these razors are cheap Chinese knock off brands.These blades will cut your face and only last about a week - if you are lucky . Even with a new blade you can feel the difference and after you have shaved , take a good look at your face and you will see and feel the pain.Stay away !!!! All those 5 stars reviews are probably Chinese working for the knock off company .
 I tried this but it was not working out for me , and had lot of issues . I was getting cuts and burns . The Fusion Proglide Power was ideal for me once I changed . No burns/cuts with Proglide power . -LRB- Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge 8 Count
 I do n't understand why this Gillette Fusion 12 count manual razor was shipped to me because i do n't believe I ever ordered it . Regardless i did not want it . This item is currently available from Costco
 They cancelled the order for no other reason than they did n't like the price they advertised .
 These are , hands-down , undeniably , without a doubt , counterfeit blades.The construction on each blade is cheap , so much that the individual detailing blade does not exist . It is simply a hard edge of the blade housing.Upon using a fresh , clean , new cartridge , it feels like running a rusty can across your skin
 AFTER CONVERSATION WITH GILLETTE , I GOT INFORMATION , THAT NON OF PRODUCT SOLD WITH GILLETTE NAME A LEGAL . GILLETTE NOT AUTORIZED TO SELL ANYONE AND DO N'T HAVE ANY ONLINE STORES TO SELL THEY PRODUCT.ALL THOSE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD FROM GILLETE MADE IN CHINA AND BEING A BAD COPY / FAKE PRODUCT.BE WARE AND JUST CHECK BEFORE YOU BUY
 Being a long time Gillette razor user , I 've come to find out that blades can last either five shaves or as little as three before it starts jerking your whiskers out and leaving me with razor burn . All I can suggest is find a better blade and try using a Schick Titanium blade . I 've had as many as 50 shaves from one blade or as little as 30 shaves which is saying a lot because I have one very heavy beard.Gillette ; do your homework and come back with a better bullet the put in my razor or get out of the business !
 I had been using Gillette razors for last 15 years . Every time they came up with better product until this one . The blade life is so short for fusion and that made me try to use Schick Quattro . I have been using the first blade of Quattro for last 4-5 months and blades stay healthy . Quattro is only just a little less comfortable compared to new fusion but stays fresh for much long . I am not switching back to Gillette .
 There have been a lot of fake blades going around on the internet from what I understand . I 'm not sure if these were or not but I can say that they were not good . The blade was shaky and buzzed when I turned on my razor . -LRB- I have the vibrating style -RRB- And the blades seemed like they were not in the right place as they felt like they were jagged and cutting me.I ca n't recommend this product and will go back to buying my razors in Duane Reade or CVS .
 The blades appear are either defective or bootleg ; meaning that they are knock off brands . Possibly made in china somewhere . These are not the real thing , and I want my money back .
 Buyer beware . I do NOT believe these are by Gillette . I bought these and they absolutely do not work as well as the real thing . The first thing I noticed was a broken seal on the package . The first cartridge broke in half when removing from the holder . The worst part is that the shaves are terrible . It feels like shaving with a tweezers . It is my opinion that anyone buying these will get ripped off . This is my first rip off when buying through Amazon so I will continue to use them.Note
 Not sure what 's up . I have used Fusion blades for several years now ; they have been great . Bought 2 packs of 8 from this dealer and they all felt very dull . Gillette replaced 8 of the 16 .
 I 've been a faithful user of Gillette razor blades and replacement cartridges for many years ! But , these replacement cartridges are the worst Gillettes I 've ever used ! The blades are dull big time , some cartridges have missing blade strips , the lubricating strip is green all the way -LRB- not green and white underneath -RRB- , the orange color of the metallic part surrounding the trimmer is a darker than on my usual Gillette Fusion cartridges ! I am pretty sure -LRB- 200 % -RRB- that these are copies , bad copies probably made in China ! This is unacceptable ! I got them from AllTheTimeWholesale through Amazon ; I will no more buy my Gillette Fusion replacement cartridges from them ! What a scam !
 I recently purchased the gillette fusion power cartriages on amazon although they were sent by a private source to my home . These blades were not or near store bought quality , after trying several blades i gave up it was like shaving with sandpaper . the product was pachaged properly , and sealed and did not appear to be knockoffs , i dont know what the problem was but they were not the same as sore bought.I have e-mailed procter and gamble and they acknowleged my e-mail and will get back to me
 I wish I could give a negative rating . The replacement cartridges were complete fakes . It only takes 2 seconds to figure out they are n't real Fusion blades . It 's like shaving with broken glass . The seller immediately refunded my money though which was nice .
 These blades are counterfeit ! I alternated daily between these blades and the identical blades purchased from Walgreens . It took only 3 shaves for the blue strip on these to be worn off , versus 9 shaves with the same blade from Walgreens . Shaves were all in the shower at the same time of day with the same shaving cream . They are just plain fakes . I tried this test with 4 of these blades , and the same result happened every time . They are just plain fake !
 Either Gillette puts in their best blades into the the handle package , or these are fakes , but they do not work half as well as the original blade I got with the handle .
 Be very careful - I ordered it and I am sure I got counterfiet . Amazon was nice and refunded but if you suspect something wrong report to Amazon .
 I have been using gillette products for 40 years . These Fusion blades do not klast 5 shaves the green strip turns white and the blades are not that sharp . You get about 5 good shaves and then forget it.I am moving to an electric shaver because these blades do n't last like previous blades from 2 years ago that Gillette made.They are expensive and they do not give yu many shaves .
 These are fakes . They make look like them but they are not . If you go to your local store you will get blades that do n't rip apart your face !
 I know these razors work great but they just never came . Got my refund though nice and easy . Seller was n't sure what happened either . Guess the mail ate it or something .
 I began using Gillette 's Mach 3 razor when it first came on the market , and was very happy with it -LRB- until recently ... -RRB- The original Mach 3 would give consistently good , smooth shaves , and worked well for about six or seven times until it dulled and began to give rough shaves . That was an excellent product . However , with the introduction of the new Fusion razor , the Mach 3 suddenly became much less effective and the shaves I was getting were much rougher.I had heard about the Fusion and decided to try it instead , figuring may that Gillette was trying to `` migrate '' its users towards the Fusion by downgrading their reliable old product , putting all their new design juice behind the newer model . I was shocked by what a shoddy , difficult product the Fusion razor turned out to be . I went from getting several good shaves per razor to , well ... none . I 'm lucky with the Fusion to get two decent shaves per cartridge -- usually it roughs my skin up on the very first pass , and it does n't cut my beard back right to the skin the way the Mach 3 used to.What 's the deal ? Did Gillette decide they no longer wanted to provide a quality product ? That they 'd rather have customers have to buy a new razor right away , rather than have us use the same cartridge a few times before needing to buy another one ? If so , that marks a huge change in their corporate policy , from giving us a quality product to basically shoving customers around and trying to rip us off . I know they * can * make a great razor -- they used to -- but if Gillette has decided to stop doing a good job , then forget it . So much for my customer loyalty . I 'll either switch brands or stop shaving until there 's another razor on the market that provides comparable quality to the old Mach 3 .
 There seem to be a lot of concerns that these may be factory seconds or knock-offs -- I found 8-packs direct from Gillette on their shop.gillette.com website for about $ 3/each , guaranteed to be factory originals . I 'd be wary of buying these bulk razors from Amazon ...
 not as sharp as the one you buy from duane reade ... these will give you cuts and burn . . will not buy again
 These blades shave me well , but only last me 6 shaves at the most.After one year 's use , this would cost me about $ 180 . I have therefore bought a high end electric shaver for the same price.I only shave with these for special occasions.Easy !
 The product did not show up on time . I tried to email the seller but they never got back to me . I still have no idea if they are going to give me the product . It is just bad business and I am shopping elsewhere .
 I bought two packs from Save-a-lot . I 'm sorry to say but these were the worst blades I 've ever seen.The clip broke on over half of them and the blades were dull . It was like they pulled the hair out instead of cutting . I will NEVER order blades on-line again .
 These blades are fakes . You will know instantly as soon as you try to use one . OUCH!The real blades are awesome , but I have n't found any real ones online . What kind of world are we living in today ?
 I have been using this razor for about 3 months now . First off , the single blade is absolutely useless , it cuts nothing , it 's just a gimmick . This however isnt that bad of an issue because in 90 % of the replacement blades , I have gone to change the blade to find all this goop -LRB- presumably glue -RRB- all over the blade , with the single blade missing ! Factor this in with the previously mentioned problems , as well as the fact that the green lubricant or whatever it is simply rinses right off of the blade head under the faucet , and it becomes pretty clear Gillette is selling this product based on gimmickry rather than quality . I feel I have given this product ample time to make sure the problems werent a fluke , but after going through literally 20 or so replacement blades , I think it 's time to call a spade a spade . I shave my head and my face both , and have more frequent problems with nicks and cuts than other razors , and even with a fresh blade , many times it feels as though I 'm shaving my face/head with a sharp rock . needless to say this will be the last gillette product I purchase .
 I had previously been very satisfied with this product , but my first , and only , 4-count package from Amazon had defective `` Lubrastrips '' that curled , leaving sharp edges that could cut facial skin -- and did . The strip was still mostly green , indicating that it should have been good for additional shaves . The strips on all four blades in the package curled and one fell off . Perhaps there is a manufacturing difference in the blades sold here versus in stores , or perhaps it was just a bad lot . I would 've given the blades I purchased in stores five stars for sharpness and longevity.See the user loaded photo of a blade with a curled strip -LRB- if Amazon has n't removed it , again -RRB- .
 Gillette Fusion Cartridges shave like they are used and not newI tried several of these from a 24 count purchase and they all feel like just before I toss them for a new one , like they have been used ??
 Not by Gillete . Do not work as the originals . I have been using Fusion for a long time and I 'm sure these blades are not the same that I have used before .
 Do not trust this vendor , these blades are pure junk . I bought these in September , and finally got around to using them today -LRB- I buy these in bulk and these finally got into the rotation -RRB- . These blades are dull , and do not lubricate the face when used . I suspect these are fake Gillette blades due to extreme poor quality . Since I bought these a few months ago , I have no way of returning these for a refund . So I lost my money on these junk blades . When a deal is too good to be true , it is.DO NOT BUY THESE BLADES , THEY ARE FAKES AND WILL RIP YOUR FACE OFF WHEN YOU USE THEM .
 The blades that were provided were poor . They seemed like they were refurbished and felt like shaving with a toothed sawblade . Terrible and of course they are now not returnable since I opened to try them . Tried three blades and all were poor quality . I have used Fusion blades from other stores and they have been fine but not these !!
 Last year I got a gift of Gillette razor and two 5-blade cartridges . They were superb in performance gliding easy on my skin . They lasted for almost 12 months ; yes , one full year . Encouraged from this experience I ordered these cartridges -LSB- ASIN : B004B8AZH0 Gillette Fusion Manual Cartridges , 12-Count -RSB- from Amazon . In fact , I subscribed to receive a supply every six months . These new blades do not shave the way the ealier ones did . There is no comparison . These ones do not glide smoothly , I need to pull the razor and it makes scraping sound ! As if I am sharpening a razor on a leather belt ! The quality of shave is not at all close and clean and it irritates the skin . I was so much impressed with earlier Gillette experience that I did not contact Amazon immediately and kept trying different blades ... . even after 3 or 4 different cartridges still no luck.The mineral oil is missing in the strip . Very poor experience ... and I have now decided to return the unused cattridges and cancel my subsciption for future supply.Update
 These Gillette blades are substandard They pull your beard and are too painfull to use . Comparing these blades with the same Gillette blades purchased locally I find the following differences
 These blades ripped up my face . The blades very rough and hard to use even with lots of shaving gel and prep . These are absolutely worthless . Try something else .
 These are knock-offs . They HURT ! The blades are n't well aligned and look different from those in locally bought cartridges .
 The blades I received were fake . No serial numbers on blades and the construction was shoddy . Felt like rubbing sandpaper over your face , very painful and very poor shave .
 If I could rate this product less than one star I would . For the price , they are a complete rip-off . I have used this product before and have purchased it from Amazon previously . The color strips on these are orange , when previously they were blue . Even the first shave from these cartridges is uncomfortable . Subsequent shaves are much worse . Do not waste your money . If you like the Gillette brand , spend a little more and buy them from your local store . These are obviously reject products and Amazon should not be selling them .
 I 've read some reviews questioning if these are genuine Gillette Fusion razors , and I have to admit I am also leary . The packaging looks legitimate , and was sealed . The razors themselves looked cheaply made , and the blades were not very well aligned . Some protrude further from others , and this was definitely noticeable when shaving with them . I 've also read reports from anonymous Gillette factory employees hinting that the refill razors are of lower quality than the blades included in the complete razor package . I guess the goal it to impress you with the starter pack with a comfortable shave and blades that last weeks , then make the money off you with the pricey refills of lower quality that require more frequent replacement . I do n't know whether this is evidence of that theory , or if these blades are not authentic.Either way , I was not impressed with these blades . The pull the hair out of my face and leave painful irritation and red bumps . Up until this point I have been picking up the $ 4 Pro Glide razors with 2 blades included . I had no problems getting a comfortable shave with the Pro Glide package , but have n't tried the Pro Glide refills either.My suggestion is to avoid these alltogether , and perhaps try the Pro Glide refills . Or skip all the chance , and continue stocking up on $ 4 Pro Glide razors when they go on sale here at Amazon every couple months .
 But I must have read the description wrong as I thought I was getting the Fusion Pro-Glide blades . I will use them till they are gone but they are not the same as the Pro-Glide blades nor as comfortable on my skin .
 This is not the same quality i buy from the store , somehow it looks differrent in packing . i tried to save some money but i guess it was not right decision . i should not recomend to buy online
 Gillette got me . I love the shave of the fusion but the cost of the blades is absolutely RIDICULOUS . It 's way out of hand to be paying this much for shaving necessities . DONT get hooked like i did . Stay with your razor .
 This Gillette Fusion -LRB- manual -RRB- cartridge currently appears in search results for Gillette Fusion Proglide -LRB- manual -RRB- cartridge.While it indeed * is * a Gillette product , it 's sub par when compared to the Fusion ProGlide manual cartridge .
 Just the top part vibrates ; the bottom part of the brush does nothing . Also it just vibrates not rotate or spin . I feel like it does nothing more then give a nice hand massage . It is just like a normal toothbrush , but heavier and eats battery . Not worth even this cheap price .
 This razor , in my opinion , is okay . Not great but not horrible . When it works the way I want to , the blades cut pretty well , and close . However , the main and largest problem is the 5-blade design . With the blades so close together , hair easily gets clogged between them , requiring more work to take out and clean . And clean you must , since it 's hard to continue shaving when there 's hair worsening the blades ' gliding/cutting performance . As for the other users who love this razor , maybe its for some people and not for others -LRB- like me -RRB- , or maybe my hair is too thick . Whatever the case , I recommend you to try this 5-blade razor out before you commit to buying the extra blades .
 This razor was a huge disappointment for me . Ironically , the Fusion is particularly bad at the two things it is advertised as being particularly good at
 I usually use a Gillette Sensor with 2 blades -LRB- although my latest pack has 3 blades -RRB- and I 'm generally happy with it . I visited my friend couple of days ago and I had to borrow his razor , which was the Fusion . The problem with this blade -LRB- and also the Quattro , and also to some degree the 3 bladed razors -RRB- is that because the blades are so close together , the cut hair gets stuck between the blades more easilly . This requires more time rinsing between strokes , so it overall does n't save you time shaving.And these cartridges are rather expensive , so I try to use it as long as possible - which means that it 's important to get the hair out of the blades before it dries onto it.I think that the overall increase in size of the blades -LRB- compared to the 2 blade Sensor Excel -RRB- helps in shaving large parts of skin , like legs or whatever . But when it 's your face with its nooks and crannys , I prefer the smaller blade that can get close to crevasses without exerting too much effort . The 6th blade feature was OK , but did n't feel like it was worth it.Remember , that with any NEW blade , you will get an awesome shave . People that wrote reviews for this product could have only just recently got it , because it actually came out only a week or so ago - so they 're reviewing what is essentially a NEW blade.edit -- Recently got this as a gift . Same problems as listed before . I 'll just use it until I run out of blades .
 I began using Gillette 's Mach 3 razor when it first came on the market , and was very happy with it -LRB- until recently ... -RRB- The original Mach 3 would give consistently good , smooth shaves , and worked well for about six or seven times until it dulled and began to give rough shaves .

I 'll either switch brands or stop shaving until there 's another razor on the market that provides comparable quality to the old Mach 3 .
 This razor ranks on par with single blade disposable bic shavers.It is positively awful . Right out of the box it caught my beard and felt like it had been used to strip varnish off the furniture . I thought it was something with the first one and tried a second . Same deal.I wondered if maybe I was doing something different so after trying it once and finding it unsuitable , I used a one week old , used several times , two blade generic disposable razor . It was far and away much better , much smoother shaving and less painful than this razor.I have tried this razor using gel , foam and shaving in the shower . Nothing can redeem it . Well . . one thing.I noticed that after I shaved with another razor , this razor glides over the skin quite smoothly .
 Love the razor but the price of the blades is hard to believe . Four blaeds for $ 17.00 they do n't last any longer than any other blade . I had a $ 2.00 coupon & still could n't get myself to buy them .
 Based on all the hype I decided to give this a try . I have very sensitive skin with a tough beard that sems not to grow in any particular grain . OK , so it has 5 blades ; truth is it does n't shave any better than the model with 3 but the blades are hideously expensive . I also have the 3 blade power model which is another bad joke unto itself . I still have to go over and over the same area , shave from different angles over the same space and it takes just as long and gives no better shave . True it was a nice touch to add the precision trimmer blade to the top side but I 'm not sure that justifies the cost either . I will probably use the 2 blades that came with it and then put it in the goodwill bag . Oh yes , by the way , it is very pretty , if that makes a difference when you are shaving .
 Gillette has a quality control problem with the blades . This is a recent problem , but it nonetheless has caused me to swithch to Schick disposable razors . The Gillette problem has to do with the blue strip on the razor face . The blue strip degrades after only a few shaves , and then it actually leaves a blue residue on your face .
 Oh Fusion Razor , Fusion Razor , Gleaming long and bright.Bring to the growth upon my faceYour buzzing , five-blade might!Your contours sleek and overformed , Your gripping action steady.Your shaving power manifold , T'would make a weak mind heady.What thoughtfulness lies ` neath your shine?You gleam like spaceship rubble!And with your `` Future Now '' design , You lay waste to my stubble!Too bad you lay waste also toThe skin beneath the hair.Now I bemoan the scabby strokesThat mar my visage fair.Purring like a happy tigerThat stalks its helpless prey , With your five and shining claws , My face you swiftly flay.Our first few dates were sweet as silk , Your touch was oh-so-gentle . But by date three you bit and chewed , You 've proven tempermental.Oh , Fusion Razor , Fusion Razor , Why have you done me wrong?Although you 're mighty , it 's too badMy skin is not as strong.Why do I keep on giving youA chance to find redemption?What razor god hath granted theeSuch epiderm exemption?Oh , no more , no , my razor friend , Your doom is clearly writtenBy tributaries crimson redThat on my cheeks you 've smitten.I wondered when I purchased you , Just what the `` fusion '' meant.Now I think it marks the meld ` Twixt shaves and punishment . `` The leading edge of science ! '' `` The future is today ! '' `` The greatest shave technology ! `` Your advertisements say.Technology 's not always good.Although it 's what life 's built on , It also causes wars and monsters -LRB- much like Paris Hilton -RRB- . I need no buzzing , layered meshOf steel that swiftly flails.I think I 'd rather shave myselfWith dull Lee Press-on-Nails . So , adieu , my Fusion Razor , Do n't leave in dour depression.Take comfort in that tho ' your banned , You still left an impression .
 Do not buy this product . I found that I got more nicks and cuts from using it . My skin would hurt from the extra friction . Stick with the MACH III . The MACH III does a great job . The Gillette Fusion is not worth the price . I used it for about a month - Now I 'm back to the MACH III .
 I found this razor as the same as the other ones . Do n't let them lie to you when you heard that this is the best one . The only cool part about it is that it has a small razor in the back that help the delicate areas like under the nose , etc
 The blades are so numerous and close together that if you have a couple of days of stubble , it becomes a nightmare to keep the thing rinsed out.So , what you end up with is a blob of your beard jammed in between the blades and you spend more time trying to wash the thing out than you do shaving .
 I 'm a girl but got a free one of these in the mail . Omg it sucks so bad , which is weird because usually mens razors are superior to womens . The blades are extremely dull and I could n't shave anything with it , the head is also small and cheap and does n't contour to curves . I had to grab my months old Venus razor to finish the job because this razor just did n't shave well at all .
 I have a Mach 3 and an electric . I 'm not entirely happy with either of them . Electric sometimes does n't cut sufficiently or else chafes off skin as well , leaving it flaky and the Mach 3 occasionally cuts me . Bought this Fusion a while ago and just got around to trying it . First impressions is that it 's terrible . I 'm glad I did n't buy any replacement cartridges . Cut my face all over the place . If manuals have a tendency to snag on your hairs at all , it 's five time worse with this -LRB- since there 's five blades to snag -RRB- . Additionally , there 's more space between the blade guards so it 's easier to cut yourself - that is , I found it hard to shave along the curve of my face/neck etc. . It kept snagging and cutting me , despite the fancy vibration . I may give it another try without the battery on to see if it works any better , but so far less than impressed . The only positive feature is that the vibration makes it easier to rinse out hair than the Mach 3 .
 I ended up buying this only because I could n't find Mach3 cartridges and was desparate for a new blade . The first couple days using the Fusion were okay , but I immeadiately noticed I could n't get as close a shave as with the Mach3 . A lot of this is that the Fusion has a large surface area , so it 's hard to do a lot of detail work , sort of like painting with a roller brush . The single blade on the back is supposed to compensate for this , but except for doing a mediocre job of cleaning up strays under my nose , the single blade was useless . The first Fusion cartridge gave up on me after about a week and left my face barely looked different before and after the shave . Even after replacing the cartridge , my face seemed to get used to the Fusion quickly and stubbornly refused to give me a good looking shave , no matter how many times I scraped those Fusion blades over my mug . I also found myself working harder to get the shaving gel and water off the Fusion between strokes , which is annoying.I should say that my face is a little weird in that the hairs grow very slowly but are very tough . I used to shave against the grain -LRB- up the face -RRB- for this reason but found I could get away with shaving with the grain using a Mach3 regularly . So , for people with softer facial hair , the story might be different.The one advantage I 'd give the Fusion is that it does tend to work best when you only use one stroke down an area , so for people who get easily irritated by multiple blade strokes over the same area , this could help.I switched back to a Mach3 blade this morning though , and could n't be happier . I have a lot more control over the shave , it 's cheaper to buy the cartridges , and in general it 's just a better experience . It will be a sad day when/if Gillette drops their Mach3 line , probably in favor of some 9-bladed shaving monstrosity .
 Not a significant improvement over the Mach 3 in terms of closeness of shave or less nicks/irritation . Underneath my unfortunately tough & wiry facial hair is very soft & sensitive skin prone to redness , nicks and the whole gamut of after-shave horrors . For my money -LRB- excuse me if I choke up here -RRB- the Mach 3 gives the best results all around of an unavoidable daily experience .
 Apparently I 'm not the quickest person as it took me a few months to realize why my face was so irritated . Razor burn and acne like i was in high school again was what this razor did for me . It also hurt , and a clean shave looked 8 hrs old . 5 blades cutting at my face was just to much for me . I 've actually reverted back 60 years to a 1950s model Gillette Safety Razor , Badger brush , and mug of shaving cream . The shave is 10x better . It 's closer , non irritating , and is an enjoyable experience . If your having skin problems , they may be from these new super duper shavers !
 I gave it a try for pretty much the last year until I ran out of blades that I had pre-purchased . I 'm done with this razor and already went back to the M3 Turbo , which in my opinion is the best of all of the gimmicky razors.Two main problems with this razor , it does not feel sharp and just drags along your skin and hair almost pulling them out making it pretty painful to shave . Secondly it does not even shave that close meaning you have to endure that torture more often.I can also add that this thing is way too big to be able to actually shave any contours or other `` detail '' parts of your face comfortably , even with the little mini razor on the front . It just does n't work.Also of worthy note is that the blades do not last nearly as long as the previous blades on the M3 , in my opinion these are almost single use blades as it gets increasingly more uncomfortable to use after even the first use .
 This is an upgrade ? This razor is terrible . I usually let my facial hair go for a few days and then shave . The system worked great with the Mach 3 but I decided to ... upgrade . Big mistake , this thing is like shaving with a dull saw . Back to the Mach 3 for me .
 For those that find the Fusion a good razor ... I will sell you my blades for 90 % off because I will be throwing them out . Its the worst razor by gillette ever ! It causes razor bumps where no other gillette razor ever did this . I got hairs growing in about 5 hrs into the day where other razors kept me smooth all day . Mach 3 is the best gillette razor ever made . My girlfriend who shaves her legs with my razors refuses to use them again . They are that bad !
 NOT HAPPY AT ALL with the Fusion ! I thought it would be the best razor ever -LRB- based on the quality and reputation of the Gillette brand and all that advertising -RRB- . Did not give me a close shave at all and found the razor catridges to be duller than previous models -LRB- like the MACH5 and Turbo -RRB- . The ONLY good feature was the single blade on the reverse side - great for evening out side-burns , but other than that I do NOT reccommend . I switced back to the MACH5 !!!
 Let 's get this straight from the beginning
 Look . I already got three freakin blades on my razor , this is just two more . Eff it , you know ? Just eff it . Call me up when you invent SEVEN blades and see if I care THEN . I hate Gillette .
 I was a very , very happy Mach 3 -LRB- and Mach 3 Turbo -RRB- owner for a decade . Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO , SO glad I did n't waste the money buying it in-store ! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft -LRB- or lack there-of -RRB- it had . I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3 's were made of metal and this of plastic . . something many companies are doing , so I guess its understandable -LRB- though not as environmentally-friendly -RRB- . I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved ! I got 4 nicks the first time ! In all my years of using the Mach 3 , I 've had maybe 5 nicks -- IN A DECADE ! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers ! I mistakenly thought that an ` upgrade ' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast , shaving machine . How sad that this is not so . I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter , but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke ; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use ! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower . It looks like it has rubber hand grips , but in reality it does not . Your fingers grip slippery , wet , plastic ; a big no-no when you 're handling a shaver . Ever time I use it , ` What were they thinking ?! ' crosses my mind . I 've discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill . Sigh.In all honesty , I gave this a good , fair run -LRB- used 6-7x -RRB- , but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3 . I really expected more from them .
 It 's a shame how Gillette keeps trying to grab more money from its loyal clientele especially with this piece of garbage . I got a free Fusion razor in the mail and hated it from the first day . The blade and the so called `` lubricating strip '' were literally worn out by day 3 . With the cost of replacement blades , even purchased in bulk , what it costs to use this thing would require most people to get a second job ! Stick to Sensor or Sensor Excel , does a better job and is MUCH cheaper .
 Four words , over priced , over hyped . When compared with my old razor , the differences between shaving experiences were minimal at best.For one week , I shaved one side of my face and head with the Fusion , and the other side with my regular razor , the Schick Xtreme 3 . I am black , with tough beard hair , a shaved head , and a fumanchu moustache . I shave in the shower and wash my face before shaving.If you shave your face and head , I recommend you skip this razor . For shaving the back of the head , the balance of the razor is awkward at best . For shaving the rest of the head , it was no better then any other good blade.For shaving the face , the balance was good , but that was about it . There was no difference in irritation between the two blades . The lubricating strip faded to white after about four shaves , meaning you are no longer getting what Gillette calls an `` optimal shaving experience . `` I tried to trim the chin area between my fumanchu moustache . It did a horrible job , no matter how careful I was and the area was left feeling extremely irritated.Consider the Mach 3 over this razor . If you must try this razor , keep the packaging and the receipt .
 This is not a good product -LRB- Gillette Fusion Razor -RRB- especially if you have a beard . The blade head is cumbersome and mine -LRB- I do not know if it is defective or not -RRB- squeaks . So for me new is not always better . I say DO NOT buy .
 I normally use a Sensor Excel two-blade , so I thought I would step out of the stone age and give this a try . Big mistake . This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps . The is probably because even after five or six strokes , the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke . So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades , it 's no wonder the fusion was more irritating . The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose . The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer , which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze . Alas , it was worthless . I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June . Hopefully it does n't bump sensors off the shelves . Just in case , I 'm going to calculate the number of shaves I 'll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me .
 I have to shave every day . This is not a good shave . It is very uncomfortable on the skin . The Mach 3 is a much better shave . I tested both for several months , each one for a week or so . Each one is the power handle which definitely helps . The fusion is rough on the skin , I even received nicks on my skin . I do n't know why this is . Do n't waist your money and time . I tested them for several months because I thought more blades would be better but are not in this case .
 I bought this razor because I had run out of Mach3 blades and remember this being advertised on television . I know that Gillette has made great razors in the past so I bought it . The design , I would give it 5 stars however , the single blade trimmer is not all that effective and like many of the reviews above it is very difficult to clean . The five blades however did not run as smoothly across my face . Yes it gave me an incredibly close shave the first couple of tries but on the third day i felt that I was sawing at my face and having to do multiple strokes in areas just to cut the whiskers .
 It gives more irritation than the Mach 3 Turbo , and does n't shave as close .
 I thought I would try a new razor and saw the fushion . I am totally disappointed and actually threw out the razor and refills before I used them all . I have never cut my face so much with a razor and by five shaves the blade was done . This is the worst system gillette has ever released - my mach three is far superior . I tried the Schick hydo 5 and it is a pleasure and leaps and bounds better .
 I typing this with 9 fingers , having nicely cut the 10th while mishandling this massive , unwieldy razor , which I received as a gift . My face has nicks on it for the second day running - corners of the mouth , where it 's hard to maneuver this brick . I shave my head as well as my face and frankly this razor scares the heck out of me , it 's an unnecessarily complex and overdone gadget brought to you by the company that in the 1960s -LRB- and this is a quote from Wikipedia about a well-known fact -RRB- `` was accused of exploiting customers by forcing them to buy rust-prone -LSB- carbon steel blades -RSB- '' because it `` held a patent on stainless blades but had not acted on it '' . Thanks Gillette , for putting profit before product and customers . I never had a problem with the Mach 3 . Hopefully my finger will heal in a week or so but this razor is going in the trash today .
 I just bought and used the gillette Fusion razor . Halfway through I said the heck with this , and got my trusty mach 3 turbo out.The razor is just too big . It feels like your shaving with a butcher knife or something . I 'm returning it to Target today after work . Seriously , do n't waste your time or money . It 's not worth it .

 I wanted to lose 15 lbs so i used this shake with 1 scoop of the herbalife protein , and 3 weeks later , still no weight loss . I would not recommend this product for weight loss , but rather breakfast . It filled me up when i drank it , but I decided to go back to eating chicken twice a day for weight loss and yogurt for b ` fast . This definitely works . I just wanted something simpler , but this product is definitely not it for me . I was even doing cardio while using herbalife and it did n't work . I will not be repurchasing this product .
 HOW COME IS IT POSSIBLE?I bought this things and cafelatte taste , cell activator , personal protein x3 ... I do n't recommend this seller definitely , , I assert seller should learn how to treat the buyer!I paid money about 172 $ ... . products price was about 133 $ ... -LRB- includes taxes -RRB- I did n't agree with my refund , but they just do that ... . OMG ... W.WI was n't at home , no body ca n't get the packages , but I request reshipping , they said , they ca n't reship before reorder , so we has processed your refundis it resasonable ? NO NO NO NO NO No !!!!!!!!!!! I do n't think so . I am so exploded ... I LOST MY MONEY ABOUT 70 $ ... IF I WERE YOU , I AM NOT GON NA BUY STUFFS FROM THIS SELLER.In the other hand , my other seller said , '' we will reship your package when i get your package '' no adding shipping feehow different both sellers ~

 When I first starting using this product , I was excited . The taste is n't bad at all and I actually felt full and satisfied after drinking it . However , not long after I started using it , it started making me really sick . As soon as I finish it , my head throbs , I feel dizzy and sick to my stomach . It makes me weak and puts a horrible taste in my mouth . I did n't find any other reviews like this so I 'm not sure what to make of it . I stopped using it for a few weeks , then tried it again today and I feel awful !
 I 'm not sure whats wrong with this particular shake mix but it tastes real bad . I 've never tasted it like this before . Something differnt about it .
 My first 1.5 weeks on Herbalife went well . The weight was coming off . Perhaps not at the dramatic speeds you hear about in commercials or reviews , but faster than I was managing on my own ; I was pleased with my progress . Enough that I ordered two more canisters from the same seller . For both orders , the packages arrived sooner than predicted , so I have no complaints regarding the seller.That 's when things started to go wrong.I decided to take a couple of days off from the program to celebrate my birthday . Some celebration - I ended up with a terrible resurgence of my GERD . It was a nightmare , I had to up my Nexium dosage and start taking a tummy-coating medicine just to make the pain stop . When I tried to add Herbalife back in , it got worse , so I gave up . And now it 's looking like I might have developed gallstones as well , which since I no longer have a gall bladder , is pretty interesting . The only change I made to my diet in recent memory is Herbalife , so ... what gives?Needless to say , I 'm hesitant to go back on it . Here I am with 2.25 canisters left , and I 'm afraid to use it . Sure , I want to lose weight , but not at the cost of my health ! And I was using the allergen-free version , so it ca n't be a reaction to soy or gluten , and I was using it with lactose-free milk!I 'd like to give it a good review ; I think it probably would 've helped me along my weight loss journey . But if it can do this to me in less than a month ... I shudder to think what might 've happened if I 'd kept on .
 I have contacted the seller and he argued with me about what I ordered . I ordered and paid for Protein powder drink mix but got personalized protein powder . The seller argued with me about what I ordered , even though the picture , the price and the description said drink mix . I did not return my order because I did n't feel I could trust the seller after our communications .
 It had a good taste but I got sick from drinking it Doctor told me it must have something in there that do n'tagree with me. , sorry .
 It was suppose to be vanilla and I received plain and it tastes horrible !!!! Now I have to throw it away and lose all that money !
 This taste horrible . What a waste of time waiting for the package and money . I will be going back to drinking slim fast which taste 100x better and is way cheaper .
 I am not reviewing herbalife product here coz i love them . i lost 20 pounds in 5 months ... But i have problem with the seller ... they took ages to ship this product . i was almost run out of my shake mix.i m not going to order from here again but rather order from some other sites .
 I 've recently stopped by the store that sells these shakes because I 've heard good and bad things about the shakes . I know that they actually do help you lose weight but they are MEAL REPLACERS MEANING THAT THEY WANT YOU TO STOP EATING NORMAL FOOD AND HAVE A SHAKE INSTEAD . People say you get energy and feel so great and lose a lot but at the same time they taste terrible.The flavors are disgusting and since all it is is powder and aloe I could feel the powder in my mouth and throat for a while and also ended up feeling sick . The woman who lost so much weight for these said the only meal she has is dinner.They work but have a terrible taste .
 article not received yet , not know the causes , but i will be grateful if you send any information about that .
 I love Herbalife ShapeWorks shakes but I do n't recommend this flavor at all , try anything else but not this .
 I do n't know what it is , but taking this product makes me feel horrible . My mouth dries out , my chest feels like I 've drank concrete , and my joints and muscles pang with soreness . This is the third meal replacement I 've tried and I 've not experienced anything like this before . Other MRs leave me feeling great . This one makes me feel like crap . Even hours after drinking half a shake , I still feel a dry dull pain in my chest , neck , abdomen , and legs . This is the second day trying this product and I do n't plan to do a third . Unfortunately I 've already shelled out for this container.Also the advertising statements are wrong . This container does not provide 60 servings but only 30 . The advertising statement says `` 30 Day Supply For Weight Loss -LRB- twice a day -RRB- , 60 Day Supply For Weight Maintenance -LRB- once a day -RRB- . '' That 's completely false . One shake is two scoops -LRB- 25g -RRB- , the container is 750g , that 's 30 shakes , not 60 ! Also the other MRs I 've tried do not require you to add other foods to provide full nutrition . It 's certainly not a very convenient option if I need to keep going to the store and refrigerate fruit to make a full meal . Other MRs provide you with full nutrition and do n't need you to go prepare something else with it . That defeats a big purpose of meal replacement -- convenience.Finally , the shake tastes the worst of those I 've tried ; it has a chalky , gritty , dusty consistency and aftertaste that never goes away . I ca n't imagine the other flavors are any better . You ca n't cover up a cruddy sludgy taste like this .
 First time I have used this vendor . Never had a problem with an Amazon vendor . Order has been sitting for 4 days now . I would never use this vendor again !!
 Ok ... I seldom write reviews so here it goes.I have never been on a wheight-loss shake diet and was very skeptical about this product . It is true that after eating it you feel satisfied and the taste is not that bad when you blend it with fresh fruits , but beware ! if you leave the shake sitting for too long it tastes gross ! I made too much once and had to put the remainder in the fridge to drink later . When I went back to my shake it tasted really bad ! I 'm going to finish up this container and then switch to Kirkland brand wight-loss shakes -LRB- the chocolate one is delicious by the way -RRB- . I hope it really works out for other people , but sadly this product just was n't for me .
 This is not a real product from Herbalife , that 's why its cheap . It 's fake and wo n't buy it again . I recommend to purchase Herbalife products only from reliable distributors not online . Most products that are sold online already expired . I will report this to Herbalife !
 A friend recommended this product to my sister and I . She is a 24 year old female and I am a 27 year old female . We were both excited to use this products because my friend loves it . My sister and I are both workout and try and stick to a healthy diet . After 2 weeks of taking Herbalife , I contacted my sister and asked her what she thought . WE both agreed we felt VERY bloated and gassy . It was horrible , we also both went up on the scale ! We would have a shake for breakfast and lunch . Something in this shake is not right , I should have read the ingredients before purchasing because another friend said there are ingredients that should not be in Herbalife . Bottom line I think this shake is for people who literally have a shake for breakfast and lunch that is it . I mean i like to snack on almonds , fruit , etc. . But i truly think if you are someone who does n't enjoy/have the time to eat this product is for you . For someone who enjoys eating healthy foods this is not a great product . I am so upset with the results . I will stick with Kefir !
 I was introduced to this product by signing up for the HerbaLife Ultimate Shapeworks plan . Although I am mostly pleased with the other products in this kit , I was shocked when I carefully read the ingredient list -LRB- of course , after getting home -RRB- . The second ingredient listed is sugar in the form of fructose . The protein source is from Soy which the most recent research indicates that soy is not only detrimental to your hormone/endocrine system but mostly importantly that 95 % of the worlds Soy is genetically modified . You can purpose non-GM Soy products in health food stores but there is nothing to indicate that the Soy used in this product is not genetically modified . The third ingredient is Corn Bran -LRB- another highly genetically modified product -RRB- . The ingredient list continues to list other fillers and additives . I was prompted to look more closely at the ingredient list after my first shake b/c the shake was WAY TOO SWEET . I am not a hater of carbohydrates but I would prefer to incorporate more complex carbs into my diet vs. simple sugars that affect insulin and blood sugar levels . After much research on internet , I was able to replace this product with a much more heathful alternative -LRB- Jay Robb Whey Protein -RRB- that uses Whey protein and contains no sugars or fillers . And the taste is much better . Now I can trade off the 26 grams of simple carbs in the Herbalife product with more satisfying complex carbs . Simplly speaking , this company -LRB- HerbaLife -RRB- started in the 80 's and seems to be stuck with the 80 's research that Soy is beneficial . Anyone up on current nutrition will know that Soy should be avoided .
 I love Herbalife products , including the shakes - especially vanilla and chocolate and cookies and cream.HOWEVER , this TROPICAL FRUIT shake is the WORST thing I have EVER tasted!I wish I could send it back.I seriously feel sick when I think about it.Hope this helps someone .
 I CA N'T BELIEVE THIS ! I GOT THE PRODUCT AND IT WAS A MESS ! FIRST , THE WAY IT LOOK WAS VERY OLD AND THE LABEL WAS FALLING APART ! SECOND THE EXPIRATION DATE WAS SCRATCH OFF ON THE SIDE AND UNDER THE PRODUCT IN THE BOTTOM IT WAS WIPED OFF ! IT WAS SO SUSPICIOUS BUT , UNFORTUNATELY BEFORE I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE EXPIRATION DATE I AUTOMATICALLY JUST OPEN A LITTLE AT THE TOP TO CHECK IF IT WAS REALLY COOKIES AND CREAM ! IT WAS BUT , I DO NOT TRUST IT AT ALL WHY WAS IT WIPED OFF AND SCRATCH OFF ? SOMETHING FISHY OBVIOUSLY THEY WERE TRYING TO HIDE SOMETHING ! NEVER GOING TO BUY FROM THE SELLER AGAIN ! IF I COULD RETURN THIS ITEM IT WILL BE WONDER !
 this guy who ever I ordered ... he sent me the wrong one ... . but anyway I gave my self a try cause you never know if I ended like it . . who knows ... . but yup I do n't like this protein powder . not Good
 I was looking for a natural supplement to help reduce my blood pressure unfortunately this product did the opposite . It increased my blood pressure .
 saw this on doc oz . . this is dangerous stuff , I threw it away after 2 pills no likey save your money and go to tastytrades ... I will update this review , I saw this on Doc . oz he said it was safe , well it is not if you have asthma , after 2 pills I could not breath , also that 7 keto stuff is dangerous too.Be careful do n't just trust anything anyone says is safe , research it on your own . . Dr. Oz should really explain side effect more . good luck
 I tried the ORAC Energy Greens -LRB- another brand -RRB- in the plastic container and in the plastic little on the go packets - when I take the on the go packets , I feel great . When I take from the plastic container , I do n't feel anything ? The same with this Micro Greens mix -- I do n't seem to notice a difference in my energy or mental acuity or feelings ? Also the taste is worse than ORAC Energy greens bc it 's kind of sweet and minty rather than just being a bland greens taste which is much more palatable . So far , I 'm compelled to go back to the ORAC greens packets . I 've heard Ormus Greens by Sun Warrior are very good too ?
 The photo shows Miracle greens so I used that as a reference hoping that 's what I would get . . But as it is written , I received Micro greens instead . Of course this will do , but I much prefer the flavor of Miracle greens over Micro .
 I received this great product in a timely manner except when I opended it , the inner seal was broken , some of the product had spilled out and I could not trust its freshness . I got a label for return from the sender but I never got credit for the product yet.Can you help .
 While I think this is a high quality product and tastes great , it 's too strong for me and I experienced reactions to it . For one , my hands and feet felt really cold the days I took it and looked extremely pale . I suspect it is from the horsetail which SHOULD NOT BE CONSUMED by those with circulatory problems such as Raynaud 's or heart issues . This product is labeled `` stimulant-free '' . Horsetail is used for its silicon content , but contains none other than nicotine which IS a stimulant and constricts blood vessels . Absorption is increased by the inclusion of yucca , which acts as a surfactant . I ca n't help but wonder if the nicotine is causing some reviewers to claim that they `` crave '' this product . I hope to exchange it and get Miracle Reds . I have written the developers of this product about it , because I think the horsetail could be replaced by better and safer sources of silicon , like bamboo or oatstraw .
 What an overpriced disappointment . All I taste is excess sweetness from Stevia . Why are almost all green formulas sweetened ? Either you want the greens or not , but do n't change the taste with a sweetener.It 's also loaded with Lecithin , an inexpensive soy by-product used as a filler and promoted as something good ... . it 's not.The only greens formula I know without sweeteners and fillers is Garden of Life Perfect Food , the Original Formula . Better yet , make your own green powders from Barley or Wheat grass , Chlorella , Spirulina , and Alfalfa powder from NOW Foods .
 We could n't force ourselves to drink this . It literally gagged us every time we tried , no matter how we tried it .
 Anyone , like me , who has used Lavilin for decades ... do not be fooled by the photo -LRB- as I was -RRB- into thinking this is the old formulation -LRB- That seems to be gone for good -RRB- or the 1/2 ounce quantity Foot Smart is advertising here . It is the same .44 ounce quantity and the new formulation that several other vendors are selling for less . The new formulation , for me , does not work as well . But still fairly well . I would give the deoderant itself 3.5 or 4 stars -LRB- the old formulation was a 5 for sure -RRB- , but downgraded the rating here because of what seems to me to be false advertising by this seller .
 The long lasting underarm deoderent is great , I ordered this foot version by mistake and had to return it ... the packaging looked identical to what I was used to
 The zombie flavor is just gross . The chap stuck its selfs is smooth and nice but I could n't get over the smell of this flavor .
 It does n't taste or smell like Grand Marnier I was very disappointed . I would rather have my chapstick in cherry flavor . Atleast It has a taste .
 I live in a bachelor suite and I find that the smell of food gets into my closet and into my clothes . I bought the Oust air cleaner fan to get rid of the cooking smell on my clothes -LRB- in my closet -RRB- . I had to turn off the unit after a few minutes because the smell was awful . I thought Oust was supposed to get rid of odor . The citrus fragrance in the solution smells too much like one those cheap bathroom deodorizers - it 's too synthetic it 's nauseating . I do n't really know if the Oust product actually gets rid of odor or if the strong fragrance in the solution is just MASKING the odor . Now my clothes do n't smell like food but my closet smells like a heavily deodorized bathroom .

 It looks nice , it looks metal , but everything but the bar itself is plastic -LRB- the shower clip , the knob , and the parts that keep them on the wall -RRB- . It will break as easily as your cheap waterpik shower , except replacing each part costs more than a whole waterpik showerhead .
 I ordered the cloth version of Zeiss Lens cleaner but I received the &#34; standard &#34; version . I ordered a count of 200 and the items were &#34; dumped &#34; into an express mailer - perhaps I received 200 or just as likely I did not receive 200 .
 I bought 2 triple boxes of these to replace the overpriced Sight Savers . I use these to clean my polycabonate eye glasses.I am not sure who came up with the solution for these , but they leave streaks and foggy areas - each and every time . I am shocked that a company like Zeiss would put their name on this product . I have tried these on binoculars and camera lenses - same result.Save yourself the grief and go get some lense cloths without the smudgy solution , and get a streak-free clean eyeglass or camera lense for pennies .

 With the `` green '' cartridges , Schick Quattro has always seemed like the best razor on the market to me ; however , with these it 's like I ca n't get even what I would consider a decent shave !! I really could n't figure out what the problem was until I came on here to rant about the new design and realized there 's 2 different cartridge styles available now . So please , head my warning , and stick to the green-colored ones ! These are a total waste of money !
 This little vibe really does n't do much . Even on the highest setting there is not much stimulation -- you are better off just using one of the little covers on your finger and doing it yourself . Fine for foreplay but not if that is all you are using to get off .
 More or less , this is the worst vibe I 've ever tried . The batteries over heat really fast and it just stops after only a few moments . It did n't even last half an hour .
 other bull s *** product , the switch did not work at all , and the product ended in the trash can . do n't waste your money
 came with deaad batteries because the off switch is loose . Tried the ribbed sleeve and absolutely loved it . Unfortunately the back up batteries were dead the next time I reached for it -

 I am restricted to a wheelchair , and so must rely on grabbers , to assist me when reaching for things in higher areas or across wide spacess . I already had one of the ergonomically 18 ' grabbers in this style and really liked the light wt . and dexterity it allowed me , over many of the other styles . So , I was very disappointd when after the THIRD time I used it , I heard a click and part of the internal workings actually came through the handle , Now , it just takes up space while I try to see if I can get my money back . Needless to say , I am aggeivated and dissapointd . DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT .

 I 've been using this product for over 5 years and even fed it to my kids as a sweetener/protein boost for their morning oatmeal . We all loved it until they changed the formula . The sweet , cakey , non protein like taste was changed to a smelly , grainy , bland mix . My kids wo n't eat it , and I ca n't even stand the smell . It tastes horrible . If you 're used to the old formula , you will not be happy with this product .
 I have been buying the Cookies & Cream flavor of this protein powder for the last year or so and was so thrilled that I finally found a protein powder that I enjoyed drinking , even mixed with just plain water -LRB- as I do it most of the time -RRB- . The C&C was the best flavor ever . Anyway , I tried the Vanilla Cake Batter flavor just to see , and found it to have an overwhelming `` coconut '' aroma and flavor that I do n't care for . I 'm very sad that Essential Naturals has apparently discontinued Cookies & Cream , it 's a very sad day ...
 I have been eating this Iron-Tek protein for over a year now and loved it , however recently they have changed the formula to a `` new and improved taste '' ... it 's horrible . It is not as sweet , and it tastes `` protein-y '' which is why I used to like about this brand because it did n't . If you are a long-time lover of this brand , the `` new and improved taste '' is not what you used to eat .

 Initially , I had a boost of energy with first time.Later after couple of days , I noticed intestinal pain . I tried product at half dosage every other day , but still had intestinal pain , but also inflammation in nerves in sinuses , and teeth.All my symptoms went away after discontinuing the the usage of the product.I have read on internet that some Cordyceps may be contaminated with mold . I do have mold allergy , and this may explain my reaction . I have use Reishi , Shitake , and Maitake mushrooms extracts without problem .
 I ca n't speak for anyone else , but this product caused me severe leg pains that were debilitating . I thought at first that I was just working too hard , but the pains got worse and worse . I stopped the Cordyceps and the pain went away within 2 days . Just to make sure , I started the Cordyceps again and the leg pains returned . Maybe it 's just me , but I ca n't take this stuff !
 Smells musty , Made me feel worse , product looked like a good representation of Cordyceps . I 'm saying it not only does nothing for me after trying for only two day but makes me feel ill .

 The first time I received this item , the box was somewhat torn because the aerosol cans were loosely packed . The second order came in a much smaller package , but the cardboard was paper thin . The package bottomed out after I started to walk it back from the post office , so just be wary.But hey , the aerosol smelled nice and even lasted relatively long . I 've recently switched to a solid freshener , because the aerosol sometimes only mixes with bad odors instead of eliminating them . I also have asthma so I think the solid freshener is the better option .
 This stuff smells nice , but the spray nozzle is worthless . All you 'll end up doing is spraying globs of liquid on the ceiling . I thought the first can was perhaps an anomaly , but the second one I tried was just the same .
 We used Glade `` Powder Fresh '' -LRB- PF -RRB- in the vivid blue and white container for years , loved it . Then came the `` NEW Powder Fresh '' , washed out/faded colors on the container matched the product now inside . Undoubtably a formulation by the accounting department . It has more of an odor of swamp gas and Chinese Chestnut blossoms than any talcum I 've ever smelled.I called S.C. Johnson & Co. thinking they 'd run a bad batch . They sent a FREE coupon good for any Glade product . Before I used it I sampled the `` NEW '' PF store product on the shelves and found it was ALL watered down . I left the free coupon for someone to use on another Glade product.Remember when the bean counters at Coke invented the `` NEW Coke '' . If you can find an old can of Glade Powder Fresh with the cheery blue sky and clouds on the can , buy it . If you like the old time talcum smell you 'll be pleased - treasure it - they do n't make it like that any more . PF is now PU .
 You know what they did ? The sent me a box that says Glade Aerosol Hawaiian Breeze 12 9 o.z. cans , and you know what they gave me instead ?!?!? 12 Avon roll on deodorants ! I was beyond angry !
 i think this was old or something ... it looked like the bottle had been used when i got it ... and the packing was all tore up . I just threw it away ... that was $ 20 that could have been better spent
 I normally love this product but not this one and I 'll explain why.Shipping was great I do applaud that but this product is sooooo OLD on the back it has the year it was made and when ever I buy this product in a reatail-store it 's usually 2008 or 2009 but the one I was sent had 1999 on the back CAN YOU BELIVE ! and the normal looking texture for this lotion is very white and creamy and smells okay but the one I was sent by this company was YELLOW & WATERY and smelled bad ... This lotion works great for dissapearing strechted skin when its not older than my brothers ! I messaged them about wanting a new one because the one I received was old and they told me no they would n't send me another with out paying for it , BUT they did say they would refund me if I sended it back but I doubt they would actually would and did n't want to take that hassel for just 20 bucks . . I WILL NEVER BUY THIS LOTION ONLINE ONLY IN STORE WHERE I CAN SEE YEAR IT WAS MADE
 I got these in an effort to combat the combination of morning sickness & carsickness on a two-day bus ride I was taking . I really wanted to like them , but the taste was absolutely awful . If you 're thinking ginger flavor like ginger ale , this is n't even close . They were spicy and bitter and just plain icky - I tried twice , but could n't keep one in my mouth longer than about 45 seconds . Bummed that I wasted the money on these , I could have bought Preggie Pops instead for the same price - and they actually taste good !! Would recommend ginger root capsules instead .
 These candies taste okay , and helped with morning sickness a very tiny amount ... but the ones I received were long since EXPIRED ! ... Why would anyone be selling expired candy on Amazon ?! Maybe if they were FRESH they 'd have tasted better and worked better too .
 I bought these while I was pregnant because I was having terrible morning sickness . Me thinking I was getting something I could actually take was very wrong . These are not what I would call `` candy '' They are very spicy when you put them in your mouth . I did not have more then 2 before they went in the trash . I would rather have morning sickness then eat these .
 Well , I tried them but did not enjoy them . I like gingerale but I guess I do n't like ginger candies . If you like ginger you may enjoy these .
 If you want to completely waste your money on a product that absolutely has no detectable taste of ginger in it . . Well than this is the product for you . . The Company should of called this product Bruce 's Yams Sweet Potato bites ... Because that all it taste like ... It taste like a Sweet Potato losenge ... if such a thing would ever exist ... WHERE IS THE GINGER !! . . What a joke of a product ...
 These tasted so gross to me . :-LRB- Yuck . These were supposed to help with nausea ... not cause it . I do not recommend this product .
 I am a `` dyed in the wool '' ginger-lover and looked forward to a veritable explosion of hot , spicy , tangy ginger in my salivating mouth.Bummer ... what was delivered was a somewhat honey-flavored confection ... that was merely bland in its intention . Disappointing in demeanor ... exhorbitant in cost .
 Basically , they worked while I was sucking on one . But it felt like a jolly rancher or especially sour apple rings worked the same if not better ... I dont think anything would of worked for me at that time in my life . Maybe for mild nausea this product would be better but not for severe nausea .
 I hated this for my morning sickness , too sweet , made me even sicker . no thank you ! I would recommend the Preggy Pops
 I had a severe case of nausea/vomiting with my pregnancy , and these did n't make a bit of difference . So if you are like me , do n't expect this to be a miracle worker ... go to your OBGYN instead so they can help .

 The product was ordered for my mom who has arthritis in her knees . She used the product until the tube was finished . The product did not work at all . She was very disappointed as was I. I would not recommend this product .
 I ordered 5 cases but received 5 single bottles . Seller states they do n't sell buy the case despite this offer . DO NOT BUY THESE !
 Paid for 2 cases of 12 , they sent me 2 bottles ... Still want what I paid for and what was advertised . BEWARE , THEY WILL NOT SEND YOU WHAT YOU PAY FOR AND WHAT IS LISTED . HORRIBLE EXPERIENCEDO NOT BUY !!!!
 Do they work ? Yes , they do . But getting them down is not an experience I 'd recommend . I normally have very little trouble with pills in general -- even calcium pills which -LRB- up to now -RRB- were the biggest and hardest pills I 'd had to deal with . These are much larger
 I have never had trouble swallowing pills . I can even swallow 4 normal sized pills at a time . But I ca n't even swallow one of these pills they are so huge . They do n't even fit in a pill cutter ! It is incredibly painful when one gets stuck in my throat . My swallowing muscle contracts around it and it is awful . I even tried cutting one in half , but it is so fat that it still gets stuck . I tried coating one in butter , and that did n't work either . They are going in the trash .
 This blade is terrible terrible terrible . Do NOT buy . It is improperly made -- it is not ground thin enough to hold an edge . You will be unable to shave anything at all with it . Unbelievable .
 This is dull , cheap steel and the local knife shop could n't even hone it . I cut myself trying to use it , and have relegated it to opening mail . These people should be forced to shave their entire bodies with this piece of garbage . A butter knife gives a better shave.Do not buy this for any reason .
 While aesthetically pleasing , this razor was a letdown on all levels of possible utility . I bought the razor for my fiance 's birthday , as he has long spoken of wanting to switch from disposables to a straight razor for the allure of A -RRB- fiscal and environmental practicality , and B -RRB- the machismo of Good Ol' Fashioned MAN skill . ;-RRB- However , the razor arrived DULL . So dull , the strop -LRB- which I also purchased -RRB- did nothing . So dull we had to go out and buy a sharpener . So very , extremely , incredibly dull , that after days and nights -LRB- MANY -RRB- of my fiance sitting down and sharpening for hours on end , until his fingers and hands would cramp , it still was far from usable on his -LRB- really not that stubborn -RRB- facial hair . While this may be the nature of the beast , perhaps it should have come with a warning that this razor is , as it comes , really more for show than use , and if it is to be used as intended -LRB- as a shaving device -RRB- what to expect
 not a good straight razor for beginners but it looks really nice if that 's what your going for . I do n't even use it .
 Saw this great deal , purchased it . If the spine and the cutting edge were actually lined up so that you could sharpen the cutting edge you would be able to sharpen it . But because it 's not , it 's never going to happen . My advice is to spend a minimum of $ 80 on a razor and you 'll actually be able to use it . Just remember it 's an investment that you 'll only have to make every few years , if you shave once in a while it should last you 10 to 15 years easy . I shave 5 days a week and I purchased mine from an antique store over 2 years ago and I strop it every use , and hone it once a week and you would n't even know I 've had it for that long .

 These are a joke . They shred constantly and require way more floss than the regular kind . It feels like you are just pulling out tons of extra floss , trying to get it to stay , having it shred , repeat . I bought these from Drugstore -LRB- an unnecessary 5-pack ! -RRB- , hoping they 'd be comparable to the Glide Crest Flosser that they are replacing . They do n't even deserve a star . What a waste !

 If I wanted to get inaccurate readings that are consistently 3 to 5 degrees wrong , then I made a good purchase . I thought that I was purchasing a valuable household item , but all I really got was a lot of `` Hyper-reaction '' from a family believing they were all really sick!Thanks for the memory !
 THIS IS ANOTHER WORTHLESS , TIME WASTED , AND TOXIC JUNK . THE FUME IS SO STRONG AND IT DOES NOT CLEAN THE SCUM OF THE SHOWER DOORS AND TILES.THEY SHOULD REMOVE IT FROM THE SHELF AND REFUND ALL CUSTOMERS . MAKE IS APOLOGY TO THE PUBLIC ON TV
 I have used regular Scrub Free for years . I love it . I picked up Scrub Free w/bleach by mistake . The fumes almost choked me to death . I had to open windows , turn on an exhaust fan and wait outside for the house to clear . My eyes watered , I coughed until I threw up . Who cares if it works or not . This product should be taken off the market . I 'm taking mine back for a refund .
 As others have mentioned , the odor is horrible - much worse than regular bleach and so potent that you wo n't want to go in your bathroom after you 've let this stuff sit for the recommended 10-15 minutes.However I might 've been able to tolerate the smell had the product actually done what it was supposed to do . The idea of just spraying a cleaner onto gunk and grime and then simply wiping it clean is an alluring one , but unfortunately `` Scrub Free '' is anything but . If you are trying to clean anything other than surface dirt , you are still going to having to scrub . And do n't forget to thoroughly rinse this stuff off , because otherwise it will leave a lovely white film over everything.My other big issue with this product is the crappy nozzle . It wo n't work at all if you 're holding the bottle at even the slightest angle away from vertical , and when it is perfectly vertical it still takes 10-15 trigger pumps to actually get it to spray , during which time foul-smelling cleaner usually starts bubbling out onto your fingers . Truly delightful !
 I never received this item . Attempting to purchase this item was the worst Amazon experience I 've ever had . :--LRB- . Returning the incorrect item was a mess also .
 I bought this because it said it was a foaming cleanser . Instructions said turn nozzle to `` FOAM . '' I had two settings ON and OFF so itturned it to ON . When I sprayed it , I got a runny , dribbly mess than ran everywhere and stunk to high heaven . I live in a 2-storeyhouse and you could smell it everywhere . I left it for 10 minutes and wiped it clean - I just had to do it again . I could have useda 99 cent bottle of bleach and some water and gotten the same result . Very disappointed .
 The nozzle is terrible because if you hold the bottle at even a little bit of an angle , such as when spraying into a sink or toilet , it will not work ... it just drips out of the nozzle down the side of the bottle . Just to use it up , because I hated the nozzle , I tried pouring it straight onto a stain in the tub and that did n't work either . But I think the bad nozzle design is what did it for me , because maybe it would have worked on other stains - if it would have had a decent nozzle that would have worked while the bottle was tilted while I was trying to clean my bathroom ! Save yourself some time , aggravation , and money and buy something else , like Tilex , Clorox Clean-Up , or Comet Spray Gel Mildew Remover .
 I have used this product twice . While it lifts soap scum and hard to move stains I threw it out because the fumes were making me want to vomit and having me constantly run from the room to escape . NOT recommended .
 Because of the bleach , it may indeed be an effective cleaner , but use at your own risk . The fumes are among the most toxic of any cleaner I 've ever used . Is it worth it to your -LRB- and your family 's -RRB- health ?
 I have used the arm and hammer scrub free bathroom cleaner before and it is really good . As its name suggest scrub free . I sprayed the stuff on , left it for a few mins and WOW!All i had to do was rinse over with water . Its a litle expensive but worth it . A lot of us dont have the time and need something potent that works . My con has to do with the supplier , I ordered specifically Arm and Hammer , just love Arm and Hammer products , BUT sender took really long to send the product and when they did SENT THE WRONG PRODUCT !!!

 i bought this because it was rechargeable and on sale . . it was larger than i thought -LRB- i was thinking a 4 '' bullet from the picture ; my fault for not researching better -RRB- ... but that 's not the problem ... the problem is the base separated from the rest of the unit when i took it out of the charger the first time - it was very poorly manufactured and i will never buy this brand again
 I would not buy this product again.it is very loud and rattles the whole house .
 This item BROKE the first time we used it . The electrical contacts are very thin and flimsy and break very easily . All of a sudden , snap , the electrical connection broke and it was done ... Many products have this flaw , this is n't the first one that has done this to us . Good power and shape , but since it can and does break very easily , we did not get to use it for very long .
 I 've had these clippers for a little over a month now and they are by far the worst pair of clippers i have ever owned . I have short hair and cut my hair myself twice a week . The length adjuster on the side of the clippers does n't hold . If the clippers are positioned all the way up all it takes is a little pressure and the blade goes all the way down . Tightening the screw did n't help either . The attachments do n't fit right , especially the blend attachment . This attachment can only be used if you do n't mind the feeling of having the hair ripped out of your head because all it does is pull . The only good thing about these clippers is that its cordless but whats the point if the clippers suck .
 Ok I picked up a corded Vidal Sassoon hairclipper at Target . The thing was so absolutely horrible that I had to come to Amazon to vent about it . The blades seemed blunt , if not nonexistent . It would only cut little tufts of hair , and the hair had to be taut , literally held by my fingers . It literally tried to rip the hair out of my head . My follicles still hurt from the hour or so I spent trying to shave my head with this terrible clipper . Most of the hair I actually successfully removed , was due to scissors . Lubrication and blade adjustment with the screwdriver had no effect -- the blades were n't * stuck * , they just * suck . * I do n't care how much money Vidal Sassoon spends trying to portray themselves as the trendy cutting edge in fashion maintenance -- judging from this horrible experience , they really , really do not know how to make a decent hairclipper . I have shaved my head plenty of times over the last few decades , and I have seen some bad clippers , but never have I experienced a clipper that was so bad that it would probably be bested by a haircut given by a sharpened stone instead .
 I am a hairdresser and used to better products.I would not recommend them.They do n't cut the hair right , hardly at all actually.I sent mine back .
 I bought these `` professional '' clippers only to discover they are very UNprofessional ! I am very disatissfied with this product and would not reccomend it to anyone . The blades guards slip off easily and the clippers get stuck in my hair which hurts a lot.Try looking for a better quality hair clipper .
 This piece of junk stopped working after two times . Do n't bother ordering this because you 'll regret it . Hindsight is 20/20 .

 I thought these were the greatest ting until i read that tea tree oil is bad for your liver . even in small amounts .
 Not worth the time . Taste is terrible , not mnuch flavor like any tea I 've had . Poor quality on the package I received , Many slivers , not smooth finish to them at all .
 NOT chew sticks but simply tooth picks so they should definitely change this listing.ThanksErik
 I shave my head to the skin about twice a week , and I had been using a VS clipper for about two years , the old clipper died so I bought this one . In the last two years they must have changed who manufactures their equipment because this one was a hunk of junk . It felt cheep as soon as I took it out of the box and when I attempted to cut my hair IT WAS N'T STRONG ENOUGH ! It would get bound up in about two strokes and then yank my hair . Not a very pleasant feeling .
 I just bought this this afternoon , I ran it through my hair and nothing happened . It does not actually cut hair , only move it around . If you want something to make a buzzing sound but not do anything there are probably cheaper options . But for me it was a waste of thirty dollars .

 It does n't taste or smell like Grand Marnier I was very disappointed . I would rather have my chapstick in cherry flavor . Atleast It has a taste .
 The wide version scrape the enamel of my teeth when that space is just a little shy of `` wide . '' That ca n't be good for my teeth . And how do you refill them ? the brush does n't screw out . No instructions come with them .
 Do n't bother -- the strap ripped out of the gel the very first time I used it .
 Did not preform as it should have . Remote is cheap and unit cuts out.Very disapointed .
 I bought this because it was mentioned that you could wear this discretly under your clothing . The part that staya outside of you is a bit bulky and akward feeling . A good toy if you would just use it in bed but not so much out .
 Absolutely horrible !!! Very loud . Upon tightening straps , one of the wings pulled off . Very cheap made . The wireless remote does work about 75 feet away . But is still a bad product .
 Purchased for my wife . Tried to carefully remove the module to install the batteries and the outter portion began to break . The product is not physically designed to work like it is suppose to . This was as waste of money and I would not recommend it to anyone.thank you
 We enjoyed the product until it broke about an hour into use . Not doing anything strange or past what I would of expected it to be able to handle . When I wrote to company that sold via Amazon I received no reply . Buyer beware I guess . Wont make that mistake again will stick to buying these things from an actual brick and mortar store .
 came all mushed in the packaging and was so bent that it could n't be used .
 Followed the instructions precisely and took this product twice a day with meals . Did n't stop my craving sweets ! Got more of a placebo effect , did nothing .
 This is more like a toy than a therapeutic massage device . It 's advertised as two speeds , HA ! The low speed was the only one you could feel at all . When I switched to high it just hummed . Six different heads do no good at all if the motor does n't vibrate . It may be OK if you just want it for your face . But it absolutely will not relieve sore muscles or tired feet . Amazon says they will take it back , so you can always do that . But it would be better to not buy it in the first place . Save a trip to the Post Office . Look at some of the other massage units . One of them must be better than this . ` Nuff said .
 I returned this product recently because it had virtually no power to loosen tight muscles even though it came with two speeds . Disappointing when you suffer with neck aches and headaches .

 As with many Ppl who reviewed this product , I too have been using the green thicker plastic ones that are pictured here and measure 1.75 '' x 4.5 '' -LRB- 5 cases -RRB- , and these have always been the only ones that are n't cheap and made of thin plastic . So after finding these on Amazon I was so excited to have found them again , and I ordered I packs of them , After waiting over 3 weeks to get them thru Nutricity on Amazon , I was furious when I opened the box and found these larger blue ones that were made of that thin cheap plastic all the newer ones are made of . Even worse was when I tried to return them to the Amazon vendor I was told that I am responsible for the shipping . I then contacted Amazon and was told that this is the policy . I think that when they show one product and then send you another , then that company should pay for the shipping one had to pay to get it and the shipping to return the items that were sent . Yet Amazon and it 's vendors think that is not the way things should be.So , I am now on a quest again to try and find the ones that are pictured in all these Amazon ads , because after contacting several places using the UPC code used here , I found that several companies outside of amazon also had a picture of these green ones on their ad 's but when I had them check they said that they found the description said blue and had the larger 2.0 '' x 4.5 '' . So if your are like me and only want the better thicker ore durable green pill stack cases then these are not the ones you want to order .
 This massager is not what I had expected . The motor is much less stronger than Dr Scholl 's past models , does n't hold a charge as long plus the head rotates making it difficult to hold a massage in one area . Additionally , if too much pressure is applied to the head area , the massager stops . I have a Dr Scholl 's older model that I 've had for several years that still runs alot stronger , holds a longer charge and does the job better . I think Dr. . Scholl 's massagers have decreased in quality based on this and another model I recently purchased . What happened ?
 As soon as i opened the packaging the on off button fell off - body was still attached to the packaging and I had n't even touched it yet . I sent it back , could have been an outlier , but it felt cheap and I was not happy . Also the color is a bit fugly . I never used it so I ca n't comment on its usefulness , build quality was substandard .
 the product does its job , it cuts hair.i opened the box and looked it over . the slide button fell off in my hand !!!!! i had to put it back together and super glue it.good product overall , if u dont mind repairing it apon opening.would not buy this product again . . cheaply built .
 The rechargeable battery life is getting shorter and shorter quickly .

 I have used another brand 's 5X body massager many times before with success but this one is a flop . It will not go into the fastest mode when you flip the switch . It remains at the same speed as the previous setting . Very disappointing !
 I bought this device because in the past we had a 9Volt that was really good . This device is not worth the price . I have had several different ones . This one runs at half the speed of the others . Even with a new battery . I would give it a negative if I could . Very disappointed .
 It was not what it claimed . No power at all . I hated it because it did not do what it said it would do .
 The item did not have 5 speeds and did not turn off . You had to take the battery out , to turn it off .
 not strong enough , wife do n't like . we been using bullet for many years , this one just do n't have the strengh .
 I ordered one of these buggers and noticed a couple of defects . 1 - it was incredibly low powered and 2 - there was no difference in power level from switch 4 to 5 . Amazon was kind enough to send me a replacement . The new one is a bit more powerful , but I honestly think this brand is no good . I have ordered the tlc space vibe version many times and have never had an issue . Amazon , I hope you discontinue carrying this specific product . Your customers are trying to give you some good advice .
 I have had many versions of this product . When I received this one I did n't use it until I went out of town . When I tried to use it after putting the battery in it was missing the 5th speed and it was shorting out on the first use . With adult products you ca n't return them of course . I will stick with the other brands from now on .
 These were horribleI think they were used not new and had no power to themI have used these for many years from different companies and never had a problem .
 I thought this product would be like the space explorer . with the 5x speed i thought there would be more power . not what i expected at all .
 This is NOT as advertised . These ` massagers ' are cheap for a reason . It says it is a 9V battery and that it is included . It does n't even take 9V battery -- takes 2 AA which = no power . Do n't waste your time .
 I wasted my money on this item . With brand new batteries it never reached full vibrating potential . We even tried several batteries . It was as if it was already warn out and it had a bad odor . My dh cut the cord to assemble it with an old one we had hoping it was reach full vibrating potential and it still did not . Now I surely can not return it . Money lost . This company surely did get over on us . Never again .

 My daughter HATES taking these . The ingredients are great and natural , but my daughter can not stand taking them because of the smell and taste -LRB- even though she has to swallow them -RRB- . The other thing is that your kid has to take 2 of them a day , not 1 . I 'd rather give my daughter 1 with everything in it and be done ! Will order something different next time .
 There is not a better word to describe this . The vibration is WAY under powered . I can pet my cat she vibrates harder from her purring than this cushion does . I could not even hardly feel it . I got it cheap , and it was a waste of money at any price .
 Product is made cheap for the price . It is a weird material that does n't stay in place to easy . It also tore in multiple spots and could n't be cleaned after one time . Not that I would use it again . It was useless !
 This product is NOT worth even looking at or considering . The `` idea/concept '' is great but the actual functionality was totally a dissapointment . Although it stayed in place the top part did not even do what it meant to do for adding pleasure to woman .
 When I first saw this I said oh great something for the two of us to enjoy at the same time . No so right . It was ok . I have had better toys
 This product is both amazing and a piece of crap . It works VERY well , does exactly what it 's supposed to and is EXPLOSIVE . However it will only last 2 1/2 sessions . I 've purchased two of these , the latter of which I treated with kit gloves , but still during the third use the jelly ring broke .
 The included vibrator comes with 3 button-cell batteries ... which do not fit inside the unit . Any more than two batteries , and the end cap will not thread on properly . The vibrator can run with only two batteries but the vibrations are very weak.I contacted Amazon and they sent a replacement . Same problem.I suppose one could replace the vibrator with another small bullet-style vibe , but why not just buy a better quality product to begin with ?
 The seller does n't missrepresent , but beware ! The material is very thin and cheaply made . Probably wont last long .
 This one 's going back to the store . It has been turned on for almost half an hour and I barely feel the heat . If you ask me , my feet in some thick socks would produce the same amount of heat . As for the `` massage '' , it 's worthless to me , but I am not one for vibrating massage anyway , I prefer shiatsu . I get cold feet when I am home and not moving around a lot , so I think I will stick to wrapping my electric throw blanket around my cold feet !
 I bought this item for the warmth . The heat level is so low that I never can tell when the heat is on . As for the massage , it 's about what I expected - no good at all . Overall , I would say this item is worthless .
 the Deluxe Pill Splitter By Apex Healthcare did not work WELL at all FOR the most important medication I needed to split -LRB- Coumadin -RRB- . I am very disappointed in it . Can you send me a return authorization and replace the splitter with another more suitable one ?
 I used this pill cutter for about 3 months then the cut started to be uneven . It would not cut a pill evenly in half , or one half was in pieces and the other half of the pill intact . With the prices of pills these days you ca n't afford to waste 1/2 a pill .

 I confess - I have not yet used this item . However , based on the use of the companion item , I can not think that this item keeps meds cool any longer than 5-6 hours - and that is using BOTH cool packs . Again , there is NO insulation to keep the cold actually cold .
 The ad picture clearly shows a Stanback package with the `` ORIGINAL FORMULA '' logo . Do not be fooled by this ad . Stanback has dropped its most expensive and essential ingredient from its formula and calls it `` improved '' . Sorry folks , it is not improved . Take a grinder and grind up a coup -LSB- le of cheap asprins and you 'll get the same effect . Stanback is now , nothing more than powdered asprin with a little caffein thrown in a speed up the asprin . They had an excellent product but have cheapened it for the bottom line . BC did the same thing . Only the consumer is holding the bag . Let the buyer beware .

 First of all the instructions are not very detailed . I had to look up better instructions on the companies website . After I finally got everything hooked up and tested as they did instruct , the machine did n't work . The line indicating active current would move , but there was n't any current . Also , the tweezers would n't grab the hair no matter how hard you squeeze them . I am returning the whole thing to them as quickly as I can get them to give me a return authorization . I love amazon , but I will never buy anything from Shopemco again .
 Unfortunately it just does n't work . Using conductive gel and electric tweezers just is n't practical . The gel dries out too fast and when it does , it is no longer conductive . If you used it in a high-humidity environment you might a tiny bit more success but still dreadfully unsatisfactory . Finding a standard needle probe to replace the tweezers and gel would probably work . Save your money .
 this product is only 6oz , need I say more ? ... real bummer that you have to fill up 2x for a complete meal replacement shake .
 This item is too bad for the cost , but it does not hold up to its `` de-clumping '' promise .
 This is a small shaker , and I find that the chilling wand takes up too much space in the cup .
 Was looking for a protein shake container I could throw in my gym bag and shake up on my way there . These containers were not at all what I was looking for . The lid leaks , I know it 's not advertised as leak-proof , but when shaking to mix the powder with milk , the liquid splatters all over the place ! Disappointed in this purchase , I 'm still on the hunt for a leak-proof container !
 I bought this from reading the reviews , but when I got it , I rinsed it out and left some water in it and tried it out and it immedicately leaked all over the place . I tried a few more times to be sure the lid was tight and same thing . It held the water , but when you shook it is leaked . My advise on this one , is to get the real deal , Tupperware . They have a 16oz instead of 12oz with a real seal proof snap on lid and the mixer that will help mix the powder . I am now looking into getting one of those . Thought this thing was worth $ 2 if that .
 I like the separate powder holder on the bottom of the shaker and the mixing ring works very well at breaking up any clumps , the removable ice packs are also a nice touch . But it is very easy to cross thread the cap and even when you get the cap on without cross threading it , the thing may leak all over you when you shake it . I bought six of these and I would say that I am disappointed with them mainly because of the leaking problem .

 I loved the idea of a wrist blood pressure monitor , so I was happy to get this one . At first , I thought my blood pressure was lower - then I tested a couple family members and then tested it against other monitors . It was always low , so I returned it for another one . Same thing , so the manager at Rite Aid let me try one more - it was also 20 - 25 points low every time.I am pretty disappointed as it was quick , comfortable and easy to use . If accuracy is important , you might want to test this against some other blood pressure monitors , though . Maybe I got 3 faulty units in a row , but that does n't seem very likely .
 I read many reviews for this type of product & was convinced by one of them from a nurse . EVERY time I have tried this I get a different reading , even back to back readings . Talking to my doctor , he said that was totally possible . But when I told him the variance between readings , he said that there should not be that wide of a variance . Another disappointment is CLEARLY marked on the box
 I figured this was a low cost unit that had good reviews so i bought one . It 's reading 10-15 points higher when tested at the doctor 's office . Being returned .
 This blood pressure monitor gives too many false high and low readings when you compare it with a manual device.It can misguide the persons using it .
 At first I liked this product and felt the measurements were accurate . After a week and three uses the monitor just displayed error messages . No matter what I did and who I used it on it would read `` error '' . For this reason I would probably not recommend it .
 The reviews seem generally good , but clearly a high proportion of what they turn out is defective , and customer service serves mainly to obstruct rather than replace . We bought two in succession and had the same experience . When they worked , they were fine . We followed all instructions and made normal use of them . In a short time , they began to show error messages or simply not register anything . Thinking logically , we replaced the batteries . No difference . We called customer service . They put us through an inquisition , suggesting that our -LRB- normal -RRB- wrists were the wrong size , that we used then too much , etc. . Really outlandish . The aim was clearly to blame the victim . We passed every test , but all they offered us was an unwieldy return , charges , an indefinite period without a meter.My local drug store tells me that they have received similar complaints and are no longer carrying this item.I would n't gamble on this one
 I bought this unit about 3 weeks ago and within one week the cuff pump does n't pump up as it should . I checked with the seller -LRB- bought it online -RRB- , she said that she has the same experience once.I called Omron and they said that I can send it in for repair along with $ 5.00 for return postage . I told them that this is a defective unit -LRB- manufacturer 's defect -RRB- , they should not charge customer for return postage.I feel that Omron who shipped the defective product should have the courtesy to paid for their own postage . The fault is with them and not consumers , thus we should NOT have to paid for their mistakes.This is the first and last for me , I do not recommend buying any unit from Omron . There are many other choices , make sure that you do your research and watchout on those rules regarding warranty information.Good luck.Unhappy consumer
 Ended up returning the BP machine . Have the larger model and bought the small one for traveling . The small one read my BP much lower than it actually was .
 I am a nurse and have used the Omron HEM-629 wrist monitor this for for past year to monitor my blood pressure . There are many times I receive the message `` E '' on both wrists and the machine will not give me a read out even with new batteries ... There does not seem to be a fix for this ... I was hoping to continue to use this machine but have decided to give up on it ...
 This model was very bad the first day work properly but the third day it kept saying error . I bough another blood pressure monitor from target it was more expensive about $ 15 more but it has work perfectly . The product from amazon are a 50/50 chance . not a very good idea to buy this type of products from this seller .
 I have not had this very long and it is already malfunctioning and I can not find a solution in the manual . I hope I can figure out how to return/service it . Also reading in dr 's i office not even close to a reading taken with it shortly before .
 Omron HEM 629 Aauto Inflate Wrist blood prssure monitor was send to me in NOT WORKING CONDISHIONS
 I was disappointed to find that i received what appears to be a used broom . Is this what companies do ? They take advantage that we as online customers do not have access to seeing the actual product and so they send used/not-as-new products that can not be sold on the floors ?? The broom works like it should . But looking at the bristles and the dustpan , it is apparent the broom was used . There is dust/lint on the bristles and the dustpan has scratch marks . The broom box itself shows signs of tear , like it was used again .
 Was easy to assemble . it is no different than the inexpensive brooms that you get from a market .
 I had some problem getting the pieces to snap together properly . It still works but the separate pieces do n't make a perfect seel with each other . Other than that ... its a broom , what do ya expect ?
 it seemed like a nice product , but I never even opened the box , because the dustpan was broken .

 I always thought a rag was made of cloth . This is a box of very expensive paper towels , pre-cut . Waste of money . Get a roll of Bounty and you 'll get the same result .
 Poor mop head design makes this product unserviceable . The cellulose sponge part is glued to a plastic plate with two protruding pegs . These plastic pegs friction fit into two holes in the plastic head piece . My first Mop-in-a-Box arrived missing the cellulose sponge completely . This should have been my clue that there was a design problem , but I just returned it for a replacement . I 've now finished the first use of my complete replacement mop , washing my kitchen , entryway , and one bathroom , with a mix of vinyl and ceramic tile . The mop has now reached the end of its life and is ready for the trash bin.On the second swipe across the floor the cellulose mop popped out of the head . I pushed it back into place , and it popped out again on the next swipe . Again I pushed the pegs back into their holes , then attempted to use the squeeze lever to wring the head out in my pail -- and found the next problem . The squeeze lever uses a simple hinge without any space between the two hinged surfaces for the cellulose mop . While no clearance would work for a sheet of paper , it does n't work at all well for a sponge that 's over an inch thick . When the hinge closes the sponge distorts , pushing a bulge out on the side away from the hinge . This bulge never gets wrung out , and so your mop stays very wet . But the distortion also tends to tear the cellulose sponge away from the plastic backing that it 's glued to . Mine has come completely loose , so I 've got a sponge that is n't attached to its plastic plate , and a plastic plate that wo n't stay plugged into the end of the mop.To try to finish my floors I ended up wiring the sponge to the plastic piece . Constant bending to pick up the mop head from the floor or the bucket has made my back sorer than if I 'd just scrubbed the floors on my hands and knees . With repeated insertions the ridges on the plastic pegs have worn smooth , so now the pegs wo n't even hold the weight of the sponge when it 's dry.There 's a scrubbing surface glued to one edge of the cellulose sponge . This could be useful for stubborn spots on the floor , but there 's no hard backing -- just sponge -- behind this , so you ca n't actually apply much scrubbing pressure . The scrubber ca n't scrub.I classify this design as VERY POOR . Out of the hundreds of items I 've bought from Amazon.com , this item is the second worst . Do n't buy it .
 I wanted to give this mop negative stars . Absolutely the worst mop I have ever purchased ... EVER ! The sponge head kept popping off the entire time I washed my floor . The only way it would stay was with the pressure of me pushing . I would get a few swipes and then off it came . I ending up just holding the sponge and mopping the floor by hand . I 've never wrote in about a product , but it was so frustrating . I finally find the time to wash the floor and then it was the biggest hassle . Do n't buy this mop .
 I can not believe this product ever made it to the market ! The head of the mop swivels off constantly , causing you to push down hard with the handle to keep it on . It is impossible to wring out the sponge head , since about two inches of the foam never get wrung out , causing water to drip everywhere . All of this makes for a very sore back . You 're better off cleaning the floor by hand ! I 've never been so quick to throw out a new product in my life ! What a waste of time and muscle ... ouch !
 The mop head has to be replaced after one mopping of a floor and tears easily . EVERY SINGLE REVIEW has been bad , which should tell you something . Finally , if you are considering the Mr Clean Magic Eraser mop , same issues . Do n't bother.I love the Magic Erasers , which you use to clean walls , so I had high hopes for this product as well . But it just is n't worth the money or storage space !
 This is the worst mop I have ever owned ! I really expected better . Now I understand why the replacement sponges were in the closeout store . They are wonderful , if they would just stay on the handle . I contacted the manufacturer and the replacement mop they provided is just as bad . The replacement is not cellulose sponge and does not clean the floor . I give up on Mr Clean mop products .
 It does n't pick up the grime just moves it around ... you think you get quality when buying a trusted name such as Mr. Clean . I ca n't believe this is on shelves ...
 This product sucks . The sponge that pops in really easily also POPS BACK OUT even more easily.Basically you get a mope handle that assembles fairly easily and no mop to go with it .
 This is not a good product . It 's just about good for one use , and that is being generous.Look around -- you will be sure to find something -- anything -- better than this for the money . It 's just not worth it.If you find it for a dollar , you might consider using it once and throwing it away . This product is a huge disappointment , and I am very surprised that `` Mr. Clean '' is the brand name .
 Do n't buy it . They are so thin thin , they are almost transparent and they tear like paper . I should have walked to my local store and buy something decent .

 This claims to be Irvin 's `` advanced '' formula which contains huperzine 50 mg , -LRB- which sets it apart from maximum gingko smart -RRB- . False description.I ordered -LRB- 6 -RRB- six bottles of advanced , and the invoice in the box stated advanced . The bottles were NOT advanced formula . No huperzine , and the bottle label is not for advanced either.I called vitamin shoppe , and it was difficult to convince them of the fact . Eventually , being an RN , and transfering to a supervisor re no huperzine , she agreed to have UPS pick it up.This is a major error on the part of vitamin shoppe , misrepresenting it on Amazon.com . The picture of the label is also misrepresented from what I received . It was not a matter of mixing up the two formulations , as they only carry one kind of Irvin 's ginko smart .
 I rated this item one star since I had bad experience with taking it and withdrawal effects.The Ginko part is great , but it has L-Dopa which is precursor to dopamine , a major neurotransmitter in the brain . taking this supplement regularly will make you sleepy and if you stop it suddenly will cause depression symptoms.Please read more about the supplements content before buying any .
 I took this entire bottle and never noticed any improvement in concentration , focus , brain agility , mood , etc. . . nothing ! Will not be purchasing this product again .
 The product did not seem to be as advertised . It was not described as having to be screwed on permanently . Would have been a problem for others in the household .
 Unless you look like Popeye and/or have the ability to rip phone books in half with your bare hands , you will struggle to wring this mop out . Even if you can move the wringer , the handle sections slide apart . I spent more time putting it back together and cursing than actually cleaning the floor .
 This is the worst mop when it comes to having to change the mop head , after the second time of having to change it i was so frusterated with the thing that i just went to the dollar store and got a really cheap one and that works better than that thing . I even attempted to try and get it off with plyers and that did not even work .
 I bought this and used it once . Right from the begining I could tell this was a shotty product . I do n't know who designed the wringing fuction but it does n't work in the least . And the removeable cleaning head would not stay attached half the time and I assure you it was inserted correctly . Waste of money !!!
 Mr.Clean my foot ! This mop is a terrible disappointment . The mop head needs replacing after just a few uses . It 's cheaply made and ineffective .
 This mop just spreads the water around and does n't pick up anything ... Takes forever for the floor to dry ... I am sooooo sorry I purchased this mop and would not recommend it to anyone ... It 's the worst !
 First time i used this mop , it left a lot of water on the floor and the mop head fell off . The instructions do not tell you how to get it back on . I expected more from a Mr. Clean product . Very disappointing . I have emailed Mr. Clean with zero reply 's !
 I have the newer version of this mop with the lever . At first glance it looks like a great design -- the rollers are flat and squeeze the sponge very tightly . The individual sponge fragments should theoretically give you more working surface and corners.Then they ruined it by putting in some of the least absorbent sponges I have ever seen . Seriously you can put this in a sink and it will float on top for 10 minutes or so without taking on water . You literally have to dunk it and wring/unwring it under the water to get any water out of your bucket.Scrubs great , but unless all you want to do is distribute the filth evenly around the floor , avoid this mop , or bring a second one that can actually get the water back up . But then , what 's the point ?
 The zombie flavor is just gross . The chap stuck its selfs is smooth and nice but I could n't get over the smell of this flavor .
 It does n't taste or smell like Grand Marnier I was very disappointed . I would rather have my chapstick in cherry flavor . Atleast It has a taste .
 This looks like a good sponge mop refill . It has a cellulose surface glued to a `` cellulene '' backing -LRB- cellulene is the stuff that you ca n't ever rinse the soap out of or dry your floor with , which makes it useless as a mop or a sponge -RRB- . However , as far as I can tell , this refill will not fit any other mop except the Mr. Clean mop it was made for . It has no screws and apparently somehow clips onto the mop frame . If they had shown a full picture , front and back , of the sponge head instead of only the box , I would n't have wasted $ 8.00 + thinking I was getting a cellulose refill that would fit my wonderful and durable Quickie butterfly mop . I looked up the Mr. Clean butterfly mop units on the website , which clearly show the screw-type attachments , and the box says `` butterfly mop refills , '' so I thought they would fit the butterfly mops with the screws as pictured on the website . They do n't . And you ca n't even find this mop on the Mr. Clean/Butler website . Waste of money unless you have the kind of mop that goes with these refills . I feel a bit taken advantage of .
 This unit is helpful in that it does not need a conventional toilet seat and that it installs by slipping under the seat mounts rather then with new bolts . But there are several issues.While it sounds great that it slips under the mounts , you still have to retain the seat and cover . Doing so means that you can not lower the cover or raise the `` seat '' . A work around to the unusual situation of having the cover and old seat in place would be to acquire additional bolts and nut to retain just this product.Another bigger issue is that it turns an elongated toilet into a smaller then normal round toilet . My 145lb mother fits on it fine , but as a 240lb male , I ca n't use this seat in her apartment.Previously I had tried a 4 '' extension type unit that worked perfectly with the normal seat and cover allowing both to be utilized , but it was too high for her . I now need to look for a 2 '' version of that style . Note that this item is non-returnable . I do not recommend purchasing this item at all .

 I normally use the lemon and honey flavored Cepacol lozenges . I decided to try these because the flavor sounded good and it had coating action . I was n't impressed . My throat was still soar after using the lozenges . The coating action was n't good either . The flavor was weak . I recommend sticking with the orignal Cepacol lozenges if you want your throat numbed . I get better coating action with Halls Chillers and they taste better .
 Just because this mop has the Mr. Clean name does n't mean it 's better . It 's actually worse ! The mop head is made up of two sponge layers , which came apart -LRB- unglued -RRB- during the first use . I tried it with two different mop heads , and the same thing happened to both . Sometimes simpler is better . I would 've gotten a better quality mop if I had just bought it at my local supermarket .
 I purchased this on the strength of the Mr. Clean name . Big mistake . The handle and mop head parted ways on the first use and refused to be reunited ! There was no direction on the packaging on what to do if this happened , the web site was useless , and the 800 number is n't manned on weekends -LRB- which is when I do most of my cleaning -RRB- . After thirty minutes of trying to fit the handle back onto the mop head , I gave up . Everytime I fit it together , the top popped off again . This was a waste of money and time . I would NOT recommend this product to anyone .
 The description of these from the manufacturer describes them as delicious ... sorry , but I must disagree.I will not be purchasing these again.I had high hopes as I very much recommend the protein shakes.Horrible flavor , consistency , and aftertaste.Great concept , but horrible execution , in my opinion .
 I thought better of foster grant . These were flimsy and cheaply made . Scratched easily and the arm springs gave out in one day for all 3 . I guess 3 pair for -LSB- ... -RSB- bucks tells me you get what you pay for . Definitely will not buy these again .
 After reading the positive reviews regarding this product , I was quite anxious to try it so I bought a tube and also one for my friend . We used the product for 7 consecutive days and neither of us experienced any pain relief . We both returned to using our generic muscle rub ointment which does give us some relief.Perhaps this product works well for people who have simple aches and pain ; people whose arthritis is minor . I first met Mr. Arthritis at age 17 and have lived with him for many years . It is a relationship that I would love to see end . It is now classified as severe and it permeates my entire body . Pain relief is difficult to find because I ca n't tolerate pain medication nor do I want to live the rest of my life having to rely on pumping NSAIDS into my body . I was very hopeful when I read how Penetran Plus helped other people but it certainly fell short for my friend and me.The plain truth is that arthritis is an insideous disease and as of this date , there is no cure . I guess if Penetran Plus is helping you then I would stick with it . Personally , I feel it is ineffective and frankly , overpriced . However , if it did provide significant pain relief , it would be worth every cent but as for me , I will stick with my generic store bought muscle rub and keep praying that one day , a cure will be found.As the saying goes `` if it sounds too good to be true ... '' Etc. , etc. , etc. .

 I work in Law Enforcement , run every morning before work , hit the weights at night and consume a lot of protein powder to help keep me lean . I have been using Beverly Products for quite some time now and have had no problems with gains or stomach problems . For some reason I thought I would be thrifty and buy a bag of the Muscletech protein because you get 5 pounds instead of the 2 pound tub I normally get with Beverly Products `` UMP '' for the same price . Boy did I make a big mistake !!! The Muscletech tastes terrible , is rather runny with almost no water and it killed my stomach . Vomited the stuff out one end and spent time squirting it out the other end in the bathroom . I am going out tomorrow to get more `` UMP '' . Tastes WAY better and without the stomach problems . Also mixes up thicker which I like as I use it to supplement meals and I like it to sit in my stomach a little longer to curb the appetite . If you read this before you buy , take my advice and try the Ultimate Muscle Protein made by Beverly Products . This one will not do you wrong .
 This product does not come with a manual or explaintion on how to use the different knobs . It is difficult to understand how to use all the nodes to get relief . So far the product has caused me more pain than relief .
 I have a lot of muscle knots in my back , and this has done very little to alleviate them . I was originally going to rate this 3/5 because I seem to be a one off , but frankly its not doing what it claims to do .
 This product is bulky and obscure . Not very useful and easy to use . I bought it , tried it and it 's been sitting in the closet ever since . I would not recommend this product .
 I left a previous review for this item saying how I received the item with no directions and just wrapped in a piece of paper . . the company contacted me a few days later about rectifying the problem and that the instructions would be sent out promptly . They further said they would credit me a percentage for my troubles and also asked if I would remove the negative review . So , I did . Guess what ??? Still no instructions sent to me and , no credit on my account ... sorry but that is bad business . I would think twice about ever dealing with this company again ! . . as for the product , ca n't really tell you how it works ... do n't want to use it improperly and cause more damage then what already exists ...
 A friend of mine had one of these that was made by a different manufacturer . I had tried hers and loved it so began searching for one of my own . I found this one and I must say , I do not like it nearly as well as others I have tried . It is not as easy to use and I did n't like the material and shape of it , it just did n't feel right for some reason . I would not buy this particular one again .
 I bought this item expecting to use it for my back but it did n't come with an instruction booklet which was supposed to be included . Now it 's a useless item . I wrote to the company who made it but they did n't even respond back .
 I bought this weird shape stick after having read all apprasing reviews . Are all these people real ? I do not know what to do with this stick , really . I am thinking of returning it but I am aftraid I will pay too much for the shipping so it will not worth it . I agree with one who wrote that some people are making very good money on this ... . I regret that I bought it .
 The writeup said that you would get an instruction booklet . Well , I got the tool with nothing else . I have no idea how to use this thing . I wrote a note to Amazon customer service asking if I could get the instructions . They provided me an email id that was n't correct -LRB- the guy who answered my note did n't know what I was talking about . -RRB- So , it might be a good tool , but I have no idea how to use it ... . I will probably return it , but it is so such an odd shape , it will probably cost a lot to return ...
 This item does as it says ok . I would n't say it saved by back or is as good as other tools that I 've tried.It is sturdy and applies nice/decent pressure to pressure points . It 's not very good for rolling pressure / `` massage '' . It 's shape is a bit awkward for some -- it depends on your size and back height , I suppose . Overall , it 's an ok/fine item . . but not a miracle worker . It 's a bit tiring and tedious to hit the right pressure points with it . I would n't buy it again for my purposes , but the item itself seems to last ok . Just too awkward to use , not relaxing , and ca n't hit the right spots on me .
 The problem for me with the cane is that I have fibromyalgia/myofascial pain syndrome and when I use my muscles they tighten up and stay that way . It hurts and restricts my movement . So , when I use the cane I am holding it and applying pressure to the knots in another part of my body , all the time working the arm , shoulder and neck muscles , causing more problems in THOSE muscles . If you are normal , I think the cane would be great . I prefer the Knobble or just a rubber ball .
 The pointed edges are too sharp . This thing did n't help my back pain at all . The pointed edges hurt . I would not buy again
 I bought this because I suffer from neck , shoulder , and middle back pain . I thought this would help and give my poor boyfriend 's hands a rest . I find this uncomfortable to use and not particularly effective for my problems . Even using it very lightly , the knobs hurt ! Some of them are kind of scratchy , too , due to the material . I considered wrapping the knobs in some sort of fabric to make it softer , but decided to just return it instead . I can see how this might be helpful who had no other options -LRB- i.e. no one for massages -RRB- , but it just is n't good for me . I 've returned mine .
 The ball ends just too pinpoint for me . Maybe I was not using it properly , but it did not relieve pain made it worse .
 I use a Thera Cane at work alot . I work in a dental offcie and so my back is full of knots :-LRB- . What I do n't like about the back buddy is it 's handle.It 's square . It 's uncomfortable to use . I should of returned it and got a back buddy .
 My wife bought me this for father 's day . I tried it out several times in all different spots through out the day and evening and to me the whole thing seems useless . It did n't feel particularly good or help in any way , I had to put some strength into it where my physiatrist says I need to keep my shoulders and neck relaxed . It 's a case of ` its the thought that counts ' here but I 'd never recommend this to anyone . Instead , marry someone who is willing to give you massages on a regular basis .
 Sorry gang , this is a cheap piece of plastic that is very hard to align over the sore spot and hurts like the dickens when you do . Save yourself the money and slam your back into a door knob . The knob is bigger and would hurt less.CONS : Hard to use - It takes a lot of fumbling to find the sore spot . Think about it , you ca n't see the sore spot , so you have to find it using this big , awkward device . It 's actually harder than you think it is because this thing is curved and huge.Hurts - The same problem with finding the sore spot shows up when trying to press on the sore spot . It 's really hard to control how hard you press on the store spot with this huge , clumsy thing . It 's far too easy to dig in and really hurt yourself . Instead of hard plastic they should cushion the knobs so it is n't so painful . And even when you press right , it slips off the sore spot and you have to find it again.Cheap plastic - It 's made of the same kind of toy plastic you find in dollar stores . Not sure why it costs so much.Design - Some of the reviewers talk about using this in the office . Not my office . The jokes kept coming in my office , and no one could use it with a straight face . It 's hard to believe that anyone would n't be embarrassed bringing this thing into , much less actually using it in the office.PROS : Amazon has an excellent return policy.Worth a few laughs in the office .
 It did not meet my needs as I had thought it would . I 'm sure for others it would do fine , but not for me .
 I ca n't even begin to tell you how useless this product is . It feel like it was made by a child . It does n't release tension but rather only causes it . I have read the `` manual '' which is actually a 4 page book with crappy pictures and I have also read different methods on the internet . In the end , I wish I had never purchased this trash . It pretty much hangs as a prop in my closet .
 I take these with a multivitamin . After three weeks of following the directions ... . I stopped . I would get headaches ... I did n't know what it was . I would be away from home and get headaches . When I would be home and have access to my supply I would be just fine , but again if I could n't have them I would get headaches . I made the correlation when I took ed them and after an hour or so my ridiculous hangover would go away . Then I dropped them like a bad habit.Don ' t know if they did any good . Waste of money .
 It kiind of works but I would rather use a magnifine glass . I have to tilt it to get light in and see what I am doing .
 I would probably have returned this `` loupe '' -LRB- actually a cheap magnifying glass -RRB- if shipping had n't exceeded what I paid for it . I have a true loupe , a 4x Schneider that cost me $ 80 on eBay . I thought that , for $ 6 , a 10x loupe would be handy for focusing my medium and large format cameras . It did n't work out that way.Only the very center area is in focus , more or less . One 's eye has to be back about 5-6 in . from the `` loupe '' . This all means that you only see a very tiny area , which makes using it a real pain . Comparing what I see with this thing at 10x and what I can see with my Schneider at 4x , I wonder if it 's really 10x . I '' m not a happy customer . This is the first crummy thing I 've gotten from Adorama , having been a steady customer of theirs for several years . I 'm disappointed and saddened .
 It 's too small for a contact sheet . It 's not suitable for this kind of job . This size is not adpated to work on a 24x36 paper sheet .
 I bought this item intending to use it to view my old 35mm negatives while assembling them in some negative holders . Either I am doing something wrong or this device was never intended to use to view photo negatives . I can not see any detail on the negatives . I thought I would be able to place a strip of negatives under the glass and be able to see an enlarged view of the negative . The only way this might work is if some type of bright back light was used under the negative .
 I just received my magnifier and I either have a defective one or I am not using it properly . I have placed it flat on a table and put a stamp under it to test it out . It 's a tiny stamp and yet it does n't show the whole thing plus , what I can see , is distorted and hurts my eyes . Is it supposed to be like this ? I can see far more with my 10x hand held tiny loupe . Guess I need to return this .
 I purchased a Carlson 10x magnifier hoping to view 35mm slides during sorting and quickly learned that this item is almost useless.Placing it right on the slide produces an image that is difficult to view.It is not large enough to view the entire slide image without moving the magnifier and also distorts the image edges.I would return it but it is not even worth that effort .
 Magnifier was bought to view details of photo slides however the view was too small ; could only see a tiny portion of slide & then it was distorted .
 The zombie flavor is just gross . The chap stuck its selfs is smooth and nice but I could n't get over the smell of this flavor .
 It does n't taste or smell like Grand Marnier I was very disappointed . I would rather have my chapstick in cherry flavor . Atleast It has a taste .

 I would think that a product such as this which &#34; retails &#34; around $ 38 and is &#34; on sale &#34; for around $ 19 , it would be reasonable to believe that a spray that is $ 4.87 / count is a &#34; count &#34; referring to a bottle of the product . So it was very upsetting to get the package to find out it is $ 4,87 per OUNCE . Unless this advertisement is changed to clearly indicate it is a price per ounce , I can only assume it is an intentional misleading . Although the product itself is very good , I do n't think it is worth $ 4.87 per ounce , but that 's just my opinion . Maybe for others , they see that it is worth that much .
 I bought it for my underarm and feet persepiration . However , it just smells like a spice and does not help at all . Besides , it burns my armpits and skin turns bright red . It really hurts first 5-7 minutes . Still looking for a good antiperspirant product -LRB- -LRB-

 Compared to the generic clippers I 've been using for the past several years , the Baldfader did cut a little closer to the scalp , though it 's definitely still a `` crew cut '' and not a what I 'd call a `` shave . '' A bigger concern is that the unit I received is * extremely * loud , to the point of making my ears ring . I would n't consider using this in my apartment at night - would upset the neighbors . Last but not least , the Baldfader irritated my scalp , which the previous clippers did not.Summary
 The Baldfader I ordered did not work . I carefully followed the instructions for aligning the blades , contacted Wahl and followed their troubleshooting instructions and still could not get the clippers to cut at all - they just scratched up my scalp . I promptly returned them and just got a small and less expensive beard trimmer at my local pharmacy , which has worked just fine . It may have been anomalous , but my experience was very poor .
 This product mixes poorly , remaining gritty even after vigorous shaking . This grit will quickly settle to the bottom requiring more shaking . Furthermore it caused an unpleasant sharp sensation in the back of my throat . Worst of all , from day one it caused copious amounts of extreamly sulphurous flatulence and some loose stool . By day four it had become diarrhea . I can not recommend this product .
 5 screws in this whole kit none of which worked on a pair of Calvin Klein sunglasses . got less than I paid for and paid very little

 The model advertised and ordered on Aug 29 , 2009 was no. 9878-511 , the model they shipped to me was the much outdated 9876-536 , which does n't have the charging light , can not be used while plugged in to the wall -LRB- corded use -RRB- and does n't have a storage pouch . The e-mail Cosmetic Solutions and Amazon.com sent to confirm my order just stated
 Worked pretty well , was okay for battery usage -LRB- I used rechargeables -RRB- . Cutting was okay , but died after about 6 months of low to moderate usage .
 My Wahl trimmer produced adequate , functional removal of hair . Inexplicably , the trimmer simply stopped working after eight months . I am undecided if I would purchase another Wahl trimmer .
 Leaves about 1/8 inch of hair behind . Other products I have used cut closer .
 I was very happy with this product when I first got it about 16 months ago . It trimmed the nose hairs as well as trimmed up my ear hair very well . I made sure I maintained it well , cleaning it regularly etc. . But after one year it sounded like it was working at full speed but it started to trim only about half of the hairs . Then it started to only work sporadically . I would change the battery to no avail and then suddenly it would start up again . But now it makes a very lazy wirring sound when it runs and barely trims anything . I give this item 5 stars for the year it worked and understand that all products do often have a certain life span . But whatever the cost of this item 1 year is just not acceptable . So for as a lasting , working product it gets barely 2 stars . I will buy another brand and caution other buyers to do the same .
 I bought this model a year ago and have never had it effectively cut nose hair . It 's as if there are no blades ! It 's completely ineffective and a waste of money . I 've tried it continually over the past year and repeatedly end up going back to my old Panasonic model , which works much better . At long last , the Wahl goes in the trash .
 I just received this product , is not like on the picture , three extra parts are missing.Also , Made in Hungary ?
 I have used this trimmer for over a year and am not satisfied with its performance . The switch is inconsistent in turning on and off . The cutting speed is slow and ineffective . I have owned an older Wahl trimmer and it is fast and works well . I would not recommend this trimmer .
 In my quest for the perfect shave I ordered this razor having tried Panasonic , Norelco and Remington razors . I currently use a Remington Microsreen MS3-3700 . I was intrigued by this shaver because it comes with 3 foils for different levels of closeness . After 2 shaves , one with the closes shave foil , and one with the middle shave foil , I 'm sending it back . The close foil did indeed give me a very close shave , on a par with my Remington Microscreen MS3-3700 , though with a bit of irritation , but it has the following fatal flaws :1 . Vibration is bad . Feels like you 're operating heavy equipment .2 -RRB- Unergonomic . I ' t fully rectanguler unlike other foils that taper around the area where you hold it . Makes it very hard to use . Btw , the model 400 appears , from pics , to be a more ergonomically shaped model .3 . Battery life the worst of any of the 5 shavers I 've tried . I 'd give it about 20 min on it 's first charge . I do realize that after several charge , discharge cyclles the battery capacity increases somewhat , but this is much worse than my experience with other shavers . It uses NiCd batteries , btw.You can do much better with any of the other brands .
 I received Wahl 7367-500 custom shave . It 's looks cheep . I think it value is $ 10 . $ 70 is too high . even though $ 50 . Do n't buy itPainful shaving beard is caught in &#12290;
 I received the ordered Wahl Shave System , but the &#34; Foil Guard &#34; was not included in the shipment . I would like Amazon.com and/or Wahl Clipper Corporation to send me a &#34; foil Guard &#34; that is missing from the shipment . I do not have anything to cover the Foil Head of my shaver.Secondly , this product is way too loud when it is turned on for operation . I am thinking of returning this product for REFUND . The product does not live up to the way its performance is described .
 AFTER READING ALL THE GOOD REVIEWS ON THIS WAHL SHAVER I DECEIDED TO BUY ONE ON 6-9-2010 . THREE WEEKS LATER THE ATTACHED TRIMMER LITERALLY FELL APART . I CONTACTED AMAZON AND THEY IMMEDIATELY SENT ME A REPLACEMENT . AFTER LESS THEN ONE WEEK OF USING THE NEW REPLACEMENT THE SHUT OFF SWITCH DID N'T WORK . THE ONLY WAY IT WOULD SHUT OFF WAS BY LETTING THE BATTERY RUN OUT . WITH TWO WAHL SHAVERS GOING BAD IN LESS THEN A MONTH , THERE WO N'T BE A THIRD . I 'M RECEIVING A FULL REFUND AS OF 7-9-2010 . ALSO TAKE NOTE THAT `` AMAZON SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT THOUGHOUT THESE PROBLEMS AND AMAZON WAS WHO I BOUGHT IT THOUGH '' . ALSO TAKE NOTE , I CONTACTED WAHL AND FOUND THEIR COMPANY LACKING AMAZON SERVICE .
 I used a Wahl 7040-614 Custom Shave 5000 for several years and never had any problems with it pulling my whiskers . Wahl has discontinued that model . I have tried 3 different Wahl models that are now in production and they ALL pull . I never know when it is going to do it but it pulls about every other time I used it . I sent one back to Amazon and got a refund and took one back to a dealer . I am getting tired of sending them back so I will just put this one in a drawer and leave it there . I am now using a Gillette safety razor . I think it is called the Mach3 . It dose a great job and I will continue to use it . I will not buy another Wahl unless I can find the older `` Custom Shave 5000 ''
 I used it one time , placed it on the charger and it never worked again . Now I face the added expense to pack and ship back for warranty repair.Not happy with my internet purchase from your company .
 Originally I read the other reviews and was optimistic about purchasing this Wahl shaver . I have a pair of wahl clippers for my head and they work great . Not that this shaver does n't work ... it does . Not as well as some panasonic or other makes , but it does work.It 's extremely loud.Now let me explain by what I mean by loud . It 's like a lawnmower . Earth shattering - who needs an alarm clock ? Just turn this bad boy on and you 'll wake the neighbors . Get my point?Poor quality materials.This is just a joke really . Made in china junk . Poor plastic and the cover does n't even stay on over the blades.Shave is just okay.Used another panasonic model and it cut all the whiskers this wahl left behind.Awkward to hold.Very bulky and awkward in the hand . Makes it more difficult to shave , especially since it 's a foil . Much too wide ! This thing is almost 3 inches wide . Might be good if you 're a giant but not on my face .
 I truly hate this shaver . This thing is 1970 's technology . It ca n't cut longer hairs so I am constantly scouring my face for missed hairs . The trimmer can cut a maximum of one or maybe two hairs at a time . If you try to trim your sideburns , it tries to yank them out for you . The head does n't pivot , so you have to concentrate to keep both blades on your face at a time . It does n't even cut the hair that close either . I do n't consider my beard that heavy so I would hate for someone with a heavy beard to use it . If I skip a day , I dread using it because it will start to get jammed by the longer hair and start to yank them out -LRB- ouch ! -RRB- . It is also noisy . My last Braun was far quieter than this thing . I just hate it . The plastic is very cheap looking as well.Overall , there are no redeeming features to this thing . My theory is that other people have made the purchase and regret it . They provide good reviews because they want you to endure the agony of using it as well . I am toying with replacing it , but I am cheap and it does work albeit not well . I also do n't have any clue of what to replace it with . The new generation of shavers are expensive and will only last as long as their batteries . AAARRRRGGGHHH !
 HiI bought this shaver based on customer reviews , , So much for trusting anonymous reviews . . First of all it 's cheaply made ... Motor is loud and slow compared to good shavers ... had to glue charger together with super glue ... one head on personal trimmer was broke ... poor quality shave even with the closest head it 's not close ... takes 15 hours of charging for a few minutes of shaving ... If this truly is the last American made shaver it 's a sad commentary on what we are turning out ... Try a Braun Free Control for a foil Shaver or a Norelco for rotory and forget this junk ... well the first shave was n't too bad and it 's all down hill from there .
 I bought this shaver based upon the reputation of Wahl supposedly being good quality . I did n't mind paying over $ 60.00 for a decent quality shaver . I am terribly disappointed!The construction is of light , cheap plastic . It does not have a solid feel to it . I could have lived with that if it gave a good shave . After charging the shaver for the required time I tried it out . It sounds like a lawnmower . It vibrates almost as much as the 5 hp vibratory plate compactor I use to compact stone with ! My hand and face were both numb from the intense vibration after I finished shaving . As I went over parts of the jaw bone I felt my teeth tingling from the vibration.It gave an okay shave . I 've had better from a $ 20 Remington AND without the discomfort the Wahl gives!This is going back.Save your money and get something else .
 I know that this product works for some , but for me it did not . That is why I decided to return it . Wahl makes great products , but this product was not for me . My skin was too sensitive and the machine irritated it .
 I never got it . It was sent to my son-in-law and he never got it . No one signed for it .
 it 's a torture to use this product , I would rather use a shaving cream and a shaving blade to finish the job faster .
 THE BEARD TRIMMER FUNCTION DOES NOT WORK . I WISH I COULD SEND IT BACK BUT I THREW AWAY THE PACKAGING . HOW DID THIS LEMON GET OUT OF THE FACTORY ?
 My reaction when I opened this shaver was one of complete disappointment . It is the worst quality build of any product I have seen since the early ` Made in Japan ' days .
 this razor is not good at all does not shave close big and hard to handle will br returning as this not good
 Charged it like the directions said . Turned it on and used it for 5 minutes before it just shut off . Figured out that it would work if I jammed the button in but that 's not how it 's supposed to be and made it impossible to use . I do n't recommend this brand .
 Shaver 's on/off switch is defective on the inside of the main casing . Once plugged in it starts and stops intermittently . Also , it will not charge its battery at all . None of this is the seller 's fault.Guess I 'll try the Braun product instead if going to the trouble of sending the defective shaver back to the manufacturer .
 I brought this shaver as a gift for my uncle and the shaver didnt work . I sent the shaver back only wanting a working shaver back . Now I have no shaver and no refund . Amazon was not helpful and gave me the run around for weeks only to tell me that they cant help me now .
 The shaver quit working completely after 30 days . Prior to that the trimmer would not snap back in place and it was louder than the lawn mower ! Had to send back to Wahl for repair or replacement . Very disappointing . The last Wahl shaver we purchased was in 1995 and lasted all these years .
 The zombie flavor is just gross . The chap stuck its selfs is smooth and nice but I could n't get over the smell of this flavor .
 It does n't taste or smell like Grand Marnier I was very disappointed . I would rather have my chapstick in cherry flavor . Atleast It has a taste .
 This product mixes poorly , remaining gritty even after vigorous shaking . This grit will quickly settle to the bottom requiring more shaking . Furthermore it caused an unpleasant sharp sensation in the back of my throat . Worst of all , from day one it caused copious amounts of extreamly sulphurous flatulence and some loose stool . By day four it had become diarrhea . I can not recommend this product .
 I received this foot bath , I used it for 15 minutes , turned it off , went back after 30 minutes to turn it on again and it would start . Terrible product .
 I bought this product for its heating feature . To my great dismay , the heat function can not work alone . You must use the whirl function with it . In other words , once you turn on the power , this thing is ON , ALL THE TIME ! It 's so annoying . I just wanted a quite bucket that keeps the water warm , which is not what this product is . Worse , once you open this item , you can not return it for any reason whatsoever , even if you do n't use it . I opened it to read the instructions , and that was it for me . When I realized that it was not how I envisioned the product to be , it was too late . So good luck !
 I feel comfort to try this machine.But three problems.first , it makes too much noisy.second , the machine is too big.third , according to the instruction , two rolling nodes and a pumice stone should be found in the box with the foot spa machine . But I did not find them .
 I returned from a LONG shift in the ER as a nurse , and was SOOO needing to use this . I had waited for this and paid the 100 bucks because it was suppose to be something great . IT DOESNT EVEN TURN ON . I have tried multiple outlets , etc -- and NOTHING . I am LIVID to say the least , esp . since it did n't even come with a return slip or packing slip -- like I am suppose to return the defective thing on MY dime ... contacted the seller -- I will update when I get a response and see if this thing is worth the money or not -- HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED AT THIS POINT .
 This product is huge , noisy and does n't do anything exceptional . Actually just throw hot water in your feet in a way I can not call it `` massage '' . It 's my worst online shopping experience ever . And to return the product I will have to pay more than $ 30 , I lost time and money with that . Pay attention
 They made me give this product one star , before I could submit this review . How can I truly give it any stars at all when the item is totally worthless ? I opened the box with great anticipation . Boy were my feet sore . I followed the instructions to a `` T '' filling it with tepid water , turned it on and waited for it to heat . I waited , and waited , and waited . I reckon I could still be waiting . It never did heat . Piece of junk I 'd say .
 This product does an adequate job of cleaning your feet and does provide some relief for tired aching feet !
 The wealth of positive reviews herein touting a better quality foot bath certainly are tantalizing , but after wasting my time reading them , alas I find that Brookstone itself apparently no longer lists this item on their own website . When Amazon says they do n't know when or IF it will be back in stock , unfortunately that seems like it may be overly optimistic ...
 I pre-ordered this foot massage spa to relieve niggling pain in my feet . Though the product operated exactly as per the manual , it was rather tame . It did n't really help reduce the pain , rather it merely tried to soothe the feet . Your feet will feel good so long as they are in the spa , but the spa does nothing to reduce the pain . I did n't think its worth spending so much money to just put my feet in hot water -LRB- & that too without salts -RRB- . I 've returned the product .
 a foot like that was one of my dreams i though had finally come n true.the food blew my mind when iopend it , it like hsving having the car of your dream , but for your feet , when on it suggested two item most people bought when they ored thr foot tub for total pampering i had a bundle price if you got the foot soak with it.when you purchase something you wish they made so you could soak your feet in soothing oil and pampering foot soaks.i pulled it out read the directi9ons and my new car became like my old care you the old car you could put foot soak and things to make yourfeet nice and soft total relaxation , but that old car you had to keep adding hot water that was a pain . but my new car keeps the water hot but you cant put any foot soaking oils or salt noth for dooth the feet , all you can do is put you feet in nice warm water , i bought even though i really coulnd afford it that day , i though they would be all gone i ordered it in august birthday slash christmas ppresent , so i didnt open it until october.so its in the closet , and im using the old car again , i wasted over a hundred dollars . . let others know its only good for plain water soaking
 As you have probably read by now , the drain plug on this unit is designed to fail after only a few uses . It is an odd shape and there 's nothing you can do to replace it with something else . When you write to Brookstone to ask them if they can sell you a replacement plug , here is their copy/paste response : Dear Customer , Thank you for your inquiry.Unfortunately , the part you have requested is not available , nor do we have a resource to refer you to . We regret that we can not be of assistance to you.We appreciate your interest in Brookstone products and hope that we can be of service to you in the future.Sincerely , KeishaBrookstone.com Customer Care Center
 It must be very difficult to make a reliable foot spa . Noting the high failure rate described in reviews of other models , I bought this one for my wife . I concluded that the much higher price of this Brookstone model would be worth paying if the unit would last and perform better.It did not . The first three times she used it , it worked well
 Bought this unit directly from Brookstone over 6 months ago . Was initially great very hot water and jets were comfortable but stopped working after 4 uses . Brookstone would not replace because after it was after `` limited '' warranty coverage . This was an expensive unit and not sure if I would get another one from Brookstone or try cheaper model that hopefully wo n't break down .
 I loved the idea of this foot bathbut the product leaked . Brookstone was great to work with for the return .
 We should have given more of our attention to the negative reviews on here , especially those who report that it only worked a few times and then never again . I received this unit on a Tuesday afternoon , later that evening after reading all of the instructions , I prepared to get some relief for my swollen feet . After filling with water , I plugged in the unit and pressed the power button , nothing . We tried in several outlets and no luck . We adjusted the water level too . So buyer BEWARE , some of these work only a few times and some do n't work at all like ours .
 I bought the item last year . At the beginning everything worked fine . During summer time I put it aside . Few weeks ago it was taken out and I looked forward to enjoying the massage by the powerful jets . However the jet on the left refused to work entirely . Very disappointed at the quality .
 I purchased the foot bath because I am started to listen to all my aches and pains that my body is telling me and thought I am going to take care of myself because I do not want to fall apart at 42 . I received my foot bath and was so excited . I used it 4 times and was real happy since I am on my feet all day . Well , sad to say that the heat and the massage no longer work . I tried plugging it in to different outlets thinking or hoping it was the outlet . I did not use any salts or oils like they advise you not to do . I was going to return it but it states that I can not return this item do to sanitary reasons . Please do NOT purchase this item . It would have been a lot cheaper for me to just use a bucket of water to soak my feet .
 I purchased this item thinking what I read about it here on Amazon would be true . Unfortunately the heated foot bath and Message is not what it sounds like . The heated part works ok , but as far as the message part , not even close . And the jets , come on , give me a break . For what I paid for this , over $ 100.00 and the most expensive one that Amazon had at the time I thought I would be getting a good foot bath . If I had to rate this from 1-10 I would give it a 3 . Only because it does keep the water warm . In my opinion it is not worth the money or even half of what I paid for it .
 Bought this thing as a gift for my wife . She was really excited to get it . Used it twice , with out any salts , and it worked great . Third time she went to use it , the jets did n't work . Got a hold of the company who sold it , and they said no problem , just send it back . So I 'm thinking they are going to send me a new one , that works . Made me pay the return shipping , and just put the money back on my credit card.If I sold a defective item to someone , I sure as hell would n't ask them to pay for return shipping .
 got it from the brookstone store . the battery in the remote was dead ... one of the leg rubber pegs was off , so it was 3 legged and worse , the plug is located at the bottom of the bath , so it runs under the actual foot bath throwing it off balance . We are returning it for a full refund .
 Jet stream came over the top and soaked me , could n't add bath salts . Returning very bad choice and lots of trouble to send back .
 Bought this foot bath for my father 's Christmas present . He loved it UNTIL it started to leak . You have to take the stopper out to dump out the water . When we put the stopper back in it started to leak . So we tried to tighten it and that did n't work . So my father said that we should go and get some more O rings for the stopper . Tried that . Only to have the whole stopper crack in half . It had been cracked and we did n't even know it . I have called Brookstone twice so that we can send it back . First time talked to rep and said that they would send an email with the shipping label to send it back . Four days later called again . Different rep-said that they had never even sent the email . And oh by the way we are not going to sell that foot bath anymore . She said she would send email so that I could return it-guess what four days have gone by again and not one word from Brookstone . Going to have to call again . And all this time my father is without his Christmas gift . This whole situation has been a nightmare !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 Considering the price , this unit was a real disappointment . Within a short time the ice blue plastic `` topper '' cracked and had to be tossed . The foot bath was not as deep as I was anticipating and as far as the heat and jets they were just so so . Hugely overpriced for the quality of product it is . Better than other foot spas on the market , but not $ 70 - $ 80 better . If this were priced under $ 50 , it would be worth it in my mind .
 I use the foot spa infrequently , primarily for helping to recover from foot surgery.I 've had the unit for over a year , but have used it only about 6 times -LRB- and being careful not to add anything to the water per the directions -RRB- . This morning , I pulled it out , filled it with warm water , plugged it in and started it up in anticipation of helping a foot recover from another , recent operation . The unit worked for about 5 minutes and then the air pump quit functioning properly , making only a clicking sound and providing no air jet flow.The only advice from Brookstone customer service is to take it to a repair shop.I am extremely disappointed that such an expensive unit has failed and requires repair after just 6 uses .
 I bought this for my husband for his birthday and it lasted exactly 31 days . After that the power button quit working and the drain plug broke . I sent it back to Brookstone , as it was outside of the 30 day store return and they promptly lost it . and are now saying I 'm out of luck even though I have an RMA number , a tracking number from the shipper and the original order number from Brookstone.I wo n't ever buy anything from Brookstone again .
 I have been having fairly bad foot pain for several years . . been to doctors and such ... . and was in the market for a heated foot spa.The reason I thought this might help , I have a membership to a gym and the heated hot tubs always felt great . So , I decided to look here on amazon for a product.It was hard to make up my mind . There are plenty of offers . . but I was looking for a heated foot spa . I had read a review on this one that stated this foot spa gets ` very hot ' . This is true.This foot spa gets very hot !! Pro 's
 I was really looking forward to a relaxing foot massage , but the bath leaked on first use -- what a mess . It did not leak from the drain plug .
 The zombie flavor is just gross . The chap stuck its selfs is smooth and nice but I could n't get over the smell of this flavor .

 I have contacted the company and have not heard back from them . This is the first time I have had a problem with them but this none the less is an issue . Product paid for , not received . Period . Will make a claim with Amazon .

 The purpose I purchased this battery was to be ready to replace the old one . The charge life was becoming low and I knew it was a matter of time before I would need a replacement.Just within the last few days , the inevitable happened and I was ready with the `` new '' battery . I was aware it would need to be recharged before use and let it charge for about two days as I did n't need to use my camera . When I did use it , it barely held the charge long enough to snap a few photos before the warning light appeared.Thinking it was new and might need a `` breaking-in '' period , I recharged it again for a few days and received the same result . I believe it is either defective or too old , but I have no way to tell for sure which it is . It may be both.I have always had good luck with Fuji , so I am giving them a little slide on rating this product for that reason alone .

 I 'm grateful that guaifenesin is now available without a presciption , a blessing to fibromyalgia sufferers . I use timed release tabs and capsules daily , and I found a recipe for mixing the powder with emu oil to make a topical skin cream.This guai comes in a plastic bag inside a plastic jar , but it 's lumpy and much too grainy , like sand , to use in a cream . I had such a hassle getting it , I 'm not going to try to have it replaced . I 'll probably use it to fill empty capsules , if I can figure out the right dosage amount.Seven weeks after I ordered , I still had not received it , and I emailed the seller . It took another week to receive an agreement to send me a replacement shipment , but when they did , it arrived by express mail in 3 days , leaving me wondering why the first shipment could n't have been sent that fast.When I try another batch of guai skin cream , I may open some capsules and see if that powder is less grainy . I wish there were some way to buy sample packets before investing over $ 80 to find out it 's not the quality and consistency that I need .

 My husband uses I-caps areds formula . This particular I-caps specifies 4 caps per day , where the one we bought from drug store was two caps per day . This was a less potent formula , so not a savings .
 The order was for 120 gelcaps which have the normal dosage of 1 gelcap twice a day . I received 120 tablets which have the normal dosage of 2 tablets twice a day , and also a slightly different ingredient list . Obviously , this made the pills twice as expensive . They were returned .

 The scent for this product is overwhelming . Rather than reducing unpleasant smells I found it tried to drown them out with its fragrance . Definitely not a friendly choice for anyone with sensitivities to perfume or even chemical sensitivities . Odor eliminator is not a good description for this item . I wish I had n't wasted my money .

 It does n't have the power I was looking for - would be alot better if kthe jet hit the ball of your foot . Just a tad better than a bason of water
 The bristles on this brush are weak , and permanently bend over after only a few uses . Buy a different brand of brush .
 As other reviewers have mentioned , the bristles on this bend easily and crumple after just a few uses . I use my brush a lot and scrub pots and pans with it , this one is not appropriate for that type of use . They make another OXO brand brush with white handle and bristles -LRB- Can get at any major store -RRB- and it is much better . I do n't see it on Amazon so I 'll have to make a trip to the store for that one .
 This brush is too stiff for general dish or glass cleaning . It 's probably better at scrubbing . Holds very little soapy water in it 's bristles , this can be an issue if your not cleaning something already immersed in soapy water . The bristles at the end of the brush do n't stick out enough to clean in front of the brush , e.g. trying to clean the bottom of a blender . Very limited usefulness for me .
 No way , this brush has a sturdy handle but ridiculous bristles.First this bristles are in too far rows , second the bristles are flimsy , in 45 days used to clean dishes before the dish washer , the item is to throw away.IKEA brushes for 1 $ always lasted , at least , 6 months .
 The bristles are too soft and splay quite easily . After a few weeks use we threw it away and purchased a different brand .

 Tried this as part of my new `` modified '' eating & exercise lifestyle change-I did NOT find that this product provided any noticable aid in the control of cortisol-the result being belly fat - nor did I notice any `` Thermogenic '' effect-even tried doubling up the dosage at certain times-a fair price for the amount & convenience for the ingredient combination had it worked as anticipated BUT no benefits for me

 I tried this on my legs , underarms , and stomach . It would hardly pull off any hair , just hurt a lot pulling on skin.If I had problems just because I 'm a novice -LRB- though I tried it multiple times , so you 'd think I 'd make headway with it -RRB- , I gave it to my sister to try who is an expert at waxing her own legs as she 's been doing it since she was in her teens . She did n't have any luck with it either so we chucked it . Big waste of money .
 I 'm Italian and I have very coarse and thick hair . When using this product on my legs it would only pull out about 10 hairs and they were randomly placed , so I would have to go over the same place at least 5 times . If you have hair like me this is a complete waste of time and money and if possible I would give it 0 stars .
 Okay so I decided to give waxing a try since shaving does n't last and epilating -LRB- I probably did n't spell that right -RRB- just was n't my thing , and I can honestly say I HATED IT ! Maybe it was just the product but the wax is SUPER messy and it pulls more on skin than hair ! I mean you 'll wax an area on your leg and u 'll go through some pain and remove barley any hair at all . The wax does n't stay heated long so by the time u finish waxing half of one leg u need to reheat it -_- . I do have to say that the sent is really pleasant but thats not enough of a reason for anyone to buy it . Maybe i 'll try a different product for waxing but I must say this one is AWFUL !!
 I bought this wax and was so excited to use it last night . I am sick of shaving and for winter time , waxing seems ideal . It was horribly painful , pulling skin more than anything else . And to top it off , it removed some hair but broke off others so I wound up feeling like I had n't shaved on a couple of days because I am covered with stubble !! It did remove about 3/4 of the hair , which is the only reason I 'm giving it 2 stars . But the 1/4 it left behind , it simply broke off leaving a whisker feel . Not happy and will not buy again ! The scent is pleasant and clean up is easy . That 's all I can say about it . * sigh * Pain for nothing .

 We own several OXO products , and love them all ... except this one . We liked the `` Good Grips '' handle and the rounded brush . Beyond that , it is useless . The sponge never recieves enough soap , which is frustrating , and the durability is nil . After less that a week , on average , the sponge separates from the plastic backing that attaches it to the soap dispensing handle , rendering it useless . The sponge is barely worn , yet you have to throw it out and buy a new one . This is disappointing for a company that seems to have such well made products . We sent an e-mail describing the design problem to OXO customer service , and did not recieve a satisfactory reply . I hope they listen to their customers and pull this off the market , and replace it with a more durable product .
 I agree with all the other reviews ! The sponge separates from the plastic after only a few weeks ! I actually came to Amazon to see if they sell additional sponges , but after seeing that EVERYONE else is having the same problem , I 've come to the conclusion that I would be saving more money if I just threw the thing away and bought a different brand . I LOVE all my other OXO products ...
 This brush has to be coaxed and begged , to allow the soap to come out ! Do not buy this product , I bought a couple for my wife and her friends , and now every time I am in the kitchen with my wife , and she 's washing the dishes I get the evil eye . One of the sponges unstuck from the brush within two weeks . Her friend 's brush broke while she was trying to take off the sponge.This is really a poor design for a company with such a big reputation . I hope they read this and re-design this product .
 I feel like it is a big ripoff to keep buying new sponges and to have them come unglued after a few uses . I can not believe that a company of this size can not find a better solution to the problem . I also feel that you are taking peoples money by selling a good washer and then selling inferior sponges . Once you have the washer it is natural to buy refills , and by the time you figure out that the product is defective you have already thrown away the wrapper and have no recourse , but to not buy more .
 I bought this thinking I would love it as much as every other OXO product I own - boy was I wrong . The sponge constantly twisted off the handle during use , and after just two weeks , the tabs that connect the sponge to the handle broke off completely . This product does not live up to the OXO name . Go buy a cheap no-name brand ; you 'll be happier with it 's performance .

 I own alot of OXO products , but this one is not good . It tears very easily , we 've replaced the brush at least 3 times . Also , while it soaps up well -LRB- as other types of these do -RRB- , it only has a rough edge -LRB- see red in picture -RRB- . You might not want to use a rough edge on everything you clean.OXO makes some fine products , but they need to go back to the design board with this one .
 Though OXO is a company dedicated to making durable , high-quality products , this is not among them . Utterly unsatisfying , the Soap-Dispensing Scrub Brush wastes soap , breaks easily , and does n't really fit into tight corners . Ours broke after only a few weeks ' worth of use , mainly because the tracks onto which the brushes glide ca n't take the stress . Ironically , the thing that makes it easy to add new brushes is also the thing which makes the device unstable . Also , there 's no way of turning off the soap dispenser ; it ALWAYS flows from the reservoir.OXO , fortunately has not been content to have just one soap-dispensing product , so if you 're really looking for a good all-in-one soap scrubber , check out their Soap Pump Palm Brush instead . It 's far more durable and less wasteful of soap .
 The sponge tears off easy . Whenever I scrub in a circle or if the top egde of the sponge gets any pressure applied to it , the sponge twists off and soap dribbles out . I gave up on it after a bit.It looks good though ...
 ... the head twists off if you apply even the smallest amount of presure . On top of that , the soap pours out when the head twists off , because this is where you fill the dispenser .
 As others have mentioned , the tiny plastic tabs that hold the sponge on snap off very easily . I figured I was just being too rough with it , so I went out and bought another one , and made sure to be more careful ... had the same problem . The sponges do n't last all that long , either . The only thing I liked about it was the oval head -LRB- as opposed to the round kind you see most often -RRB- made it easier to wash tall , narrow glasses . I went back to the ordinary kind I can buy at the supermarket .
 It is poorly made . The little plastic pieces that hold the brush on have broken off . I would not buy another one !
 Some mistake somewhere , I did not buy this product ! I did buy another product for my Hydrofloss machine but not this .
 This product does not grab hairs very well and make it very difficult to pull ingrown hairs . The point is sharp .
 I have just bought this product . And What I got was horrible . It does not grip hairs at all , therefore it does not pick up hairs at all.I think what I got is imperfect one . I do not recommend this product for anyone !
 The zombie flavor is just gross . The chap stuck its selfs is smooth and nice but I could n't get over the smell of this flavor .
 It does n't taste or smell like Grand Marnier I was very disappointed . I would rather have my chapstick in cherry flavor . Atleast It has a taste .
 Soap comes out when you press the button at the top . It also comes out on its own , without any human intervention . This means filling it more often , plus wasted soap.This brush offers bristle replacement , which is a neat feature . I was considering replacing the bristles when the brush fell apart completely . It was n't dropped or misused . I think the brush just is n't very durable.I would n't buy this brush again .
 I bought that item after having read the reviews , most of them where positive , but I 'm dissapointed by it.It 's hard to get the soap out of there . I have to push hard and a few times before the soap is coming a little bit out . It 's easy to clean plates , pots and pans . As I use only non stick pans , it 's perfect cause it does n't scratch them . Forget cleaning glasses , cups or even flatware with it .
 I had this for about two weeks . It leaked dishsoap everywhere , and I did n't find it helpful for washing at all . I guess I 'm a sponge girl .
 This came as part of a multi-item order . The box was mangled -LRB- rare event -RRB- , but the scrub brush was the only thing affected . The bristles fell off and would not stay on , no matter what I did . I do n't want to pay to return such a small item , but was disappointed . Amazon is usually so reliable . I bought anther brand which works perfectly .
 This is a good looking brush and it is certainly functional , but it is not cost effective , especially when there are much better options . For this brush , the brush head is permanently attached to the unit . When the brush hair get old , you will have to toss it away . Believe me , the brush hair will get soft or dirty pretty fast . Even if you are frugal/saving , you will need to replace the brush hair once every 6 months if not more often . When the time comes , you will have to throw the entire thing away.There are cheaper brushes sold by other companies . Even Oxo sells two other palm brushes where the brush hair component can be replaced . One looks very similar to this but it is difficult to find . The other one is theOxo SteeL Soap Squirting Palm Brush . Yes , the SteeL brush is more expensive , but you will save money in the long run because you can replace the brush head withOxo SteeL Soap Squirting Palm Brush Refills , 2-Pack . Here is a quick math , three of these permanent brushes -LRB- $ 18 -RRB- cost more than one SteeL brush with two replacement brush heads -LRB- $ 15 -RRB- . If you believe you will go through three of these brushes , than you might as well get the SteeL version . Now , it would be even cheaper if you can get hold of a non-SteeL replaceable palm brush.I am giving this a 2-stars .
 As anther reviewer said , the brush head falls off . I examined it with magnifying lenses , but can not make it stay on . A simple tool should simply work . If it needs writen instructions/can not easily be made to function , it 's pointless . I 'm a fan of OXO design , but this one seems to have a high fail rate . The design and materials of this are very nice , too bad this goes in my trash .
 I liked this brush a lot when I first ordered it but , after using it for about a month , the bristles were completely flattened like a pancake and the brush was useless for scrubbing - and it is not as if I was cleaning anything super aggressively either , just pre-washing stuff for the dishwasher . I generally like OXO products and it was a comparatively expensive dish brush . I expected it to hold up way , WAY better . I feel kind of ripped off.I know there are a lot of positive reviews - that 's why I ordered this particular brush in the first place . Maybe the product is being manufactured differently now or maybe a lot of people are reviewing the brush right when they first get it which is really misleading ? In any case , for me , it was a total waste of money .
 The squeegee itself is o k the but suction cup holder will not stay on the tile . So I had to drill a hole through the handle and then put a nylon cord thru it to hang it on hooks that I have in the shower .
 I have an old squeege identical to this one . The old one has worked great for many years . The new one was returned because it was so warped it would not work . It was shipped to Florida during the summer and MAY have had heat damage during shipping . I continue to use the old one ...
 There may be some situation where this product may work well , but in a shower it does not . The handle is so curved that it obstructs contact with the glass . The rubber part of the squeegee is also very firm which does n't allow full contact with the glass . I would n't recommend .
 This brush was misrepresented and is not 10.5 inches long , but 7 inches rather . The only reason I purchased this was because it said 10.5 inches and it will not work for my purpose . Additionally , the bristles are not as tough as I thought they would be .
 Too soft , reach bottom of container but brush is so soft at tip make cleaning very difficult . Would not buy
 I wanted this to clean bottles . It does not fit in most standard bottles . Why do you call it a bottle brush ? You should call it a cup and glass brush .
 I can see how this would be the perfect brush for delicate items . Crystal , anyone ? But ... I do n't have delicate items . I have lots of things like the coffee pot that frequently get built up residue that will only come out with a stiff bottle brush . This is not that kind of bottle brush . The bristles are very , very soft . You might be able to irritate the skin on your hand with it if you rubbed the brush on it about a thousand times . Do n't try it - this is just a way for me to let you know how soft the brush seems to me .
 This bottle brush was presented as `` ordered by others '' when I selected Thermos Nissan 61oz Stainless Steel Bottle . Problem is , it 's too short , does n't reach the bottom of the bottle .
 I was hoping to clean the inside of my stainless steel thermos coffee pot with this brush . The good thing is that it fit through the small opening and the handle is long enough to reach the bottom of the 12 cup thermos , but the brush 's bristles are so weak that virtually none of the brown coating from the coffee came off the sides and bottom of the thermos . I tried both dishsoap and a scratch free cleaning powder along with hot water , but this brush was useless . I 'll have to keep searching for one with more sturdy bristles .
 Bought one of thse brushes years ago that has a black handle and still have the brush this day , using it EVERY DAY to clean my coffee pot , parts and cup at work . Bought this new Oxo brush with the white handle to use at home and left it in the hot dish water and found that the bristles are so soft that they warped on one side just sitting in the dish water . In any case , this brush is absolute junk compared to the old Oxo and the company ought to be ashamed .
 The bristles on this brush are softer than you would think . The white bristles are pretty soft , and the blue ones are a little more stiff . It just feels like when using this to brush out my hydration bottle , that the bristles are so soft , they do n't do much because they just bend to the core of the brush instead of sticking out and actually brushing the bottle . After one use of this brush , my blue bristles are already bent out of shape and stuck to the core of the brush ... would not recommend to anyone else ...
 Great design , very poor execution . The bristles are so soft that the brush deforms if you leave it in the sink . Does n't clean my stainless coffee carafe thoroughly .
 it 's well made and comfortable but the bristles are too large to get in narrow ` bottle ' openingsbetter as a dish scrubber
 i am looking for a brush to clean thermos and they say they are long but they are not long enough so no it does not do the job
 The only way to clean a Thermos is Automatic dish soap and boiling hot water . Shake every five minutes for 20 minutes and it will be as clean as a whistle only way to clean a thermos . Does not clean the side of the Thermos because it is too stiff and it will not even clean the bottom . I scrubbed for half an hour and looked into the thermos and the bottom only had a small area that was clean ... So this looks like it will work but it wo n't ...
 Have a look at the photograph and you will see that the head of brush is about half to three quarters an inch across , with the bristles I would guess you would struggle to fit it into any bottle with a mouth less than 1 inch.It is also very short -LRB- shorter than most bottles and flasks -RRB- . In short it is too wide and too short to use in most glass bottles , thermos flasks , or the Guinea Pig 's bottle -LRB- which is what I bought it for -RRB- . It would work for wide mouth baby bottles , wine glasses , and plastic sport bottles , but I have no problem cleaning these without buying a special brush . I do n't know what I will do with mine - probably keep in the drawer and throw it out next time we move ...
 I was really disappointed in this brush . The way I viewed it was to clean the inside of the top of the Contigo lid . I did not want a bottle brush . I did not send it back , as I will use it for a bottle brush . Those lids need cleaning very good when you use it every day as I do . Look for something to clean them with and I will be happy . I love the cup ! Sharon Briceno
 If you are buying this to wash wine bottles , it will not work . Baby bottles etc will be fine . Construction appears to be ok
 The bristles on this brush are so soft they will not remove anything . I used glass jars to make yogurt in , the brush will not remove the yogurt left inside the jars . I had better luck putting some soap and water in the jar , putting the lid on , and shaking it .
 Whoa , unbelievable , the diameter of the plastic shaft is BIGGER then a standard wine , water , etc etc bottle.I can not believe that is not even a consideration worth mentioning in the manufacturer or amazon description
 the brush is very , very , soft maybe too soft to effectively clean what i needed it to . In a case such as this its best to touch test before purchasing
 I usually love OXO products so I had high hopes when I bought this . But it does an inferior job to either of the other two bottle brushes I have , the sponge one and the hard bristle one . I would never buy it again .
 It 's not that I do n't like it * completely * because it 's sorta-kinda usable , but I do n't know for how long . It 's pretty flimsy , and I 'm afraid to put a lot of pressure on it . I bought it to use with my Hydro Flask stainless steel drinking bottle , and it is too flimsy to do the job correctly . It was a $ 5 add-on , and I could n't be bothered to return it . YMMV .
 I was expecting something a little firmer to really scrub out the gunge in my water bottle . This only works if I use it while things are still ` fresh ' .
 Decent quality . It would just be nice if it actually fit into real , honest-to-god bottles -LRB- and not just the wide-mouthed containers it seems to be made for -RRB- .
 It is very misleading to say this fits bottles . No , it fits baby bottles . Not typical bottles . Not beer , wine , olive oil , etc. etc. bottles .
 I would love to let people know what I thought of this product , but I ca n't because I never received it . After waiting for almost 2 weeks I still did n't have my package . I attempted emailing the company Women 's Wellness , but they never responded . Luckily , Amazon took care of the situation and credited my money back . Women 's Wellness should n't be selling through Amazon .
 this one totly not work , when i use it , nothing happen at my sink , i am so dispoint about this one .
 My home based company , doing ceramic and stone restorations , has used these grout brushes for years and were VERY happy with the product until the company , OXO , decided to change the look and texture of the bristles . What you see pictured to the right is not the brush you receive , but rather the old version . The new design has an altered head shape and the bristles are much softer and splay apart quickly like the cheaper versions found at the large box stores . In the past I have gotten the pictured version at Ace Hardware for the price of about $ 8.00 , exspensive but because of their bristle sturdiness well worth the price . My question is this ... OXO , why change a functual design , and Amazon , why not update your web site with the current picture of the product ?
 Purchased this a few weeks ago to clean tile grout.Bristles bent out of shape after a short time.OXO usually makes good products but not this one.A loser .
 I purchased a Wagner 915 steamer . This advertisement led me to believe that it was a Wagner attachment and could be used with the steamer . It is nothing more than a brush that could have been purchased anywhere .
 I have stuff I needed to scrub really hard to get clean . The bristles on this brush bend and fold over . They are long and just do n't feel like I can get any muscle behind my scrubs .
 Very disappointed in this product . The bristles are too soft to really clean grout and the shape of the head is n't optimal for that purpose either .
 While the broom itself works fairly well , the dust pan does n't lie flush with the floor . This means it 's impossible to get fine particles into the pan . I continue to sweep and there 's always a fine line of cat litter on the floor . Since that 's the main thing I purchased it for , it 's a complete waste for me . I 'm now off to search for a stand up broom and dustpan instead ... hopefully one that will pick up traces of cat litter . If only I could train my cats not to track litter or to sweep up after themselves ...
 My old dustpan and brush was getting a bit nasty , so I ordered this as replacement . It really did n't pick up any dirt at all . Amazing how useless a product can be . I 'm still using my old brush .
 The dustpan and brush look nice and handle fairly well also , as expected from an OXO Grips product . Unfortunately the dustpan does n't sit flush to the floor , so when you sweep dust and garbage into the pan , half the dirt misses the dustpan .
 light , small and narrow head and with a heavy handle . A bit off balance for use around kitchen . As the handle is too heavy , you loose the feeling of connection with the broom head , compounded with a small and narrow head , I have a difficult time picking up things from the floor . Not as expected from read the reviews . In comparison , my old one from local home improvement store is much easier to handle and faster in cleaning the floor . I realized that it had a wider head and lighter handle which you can use by one hand and have a great connection with the floor . It is almost parallel with the feeling on the steering wheel in cars . To me , the OXO is more expensive but hard to use . It is solid build but not ideal around kitchen or inside of the house . in fact , I am not sure where it would be an ideal use with the rather limit head . I am 5 ' 10 '' , male .
 They might as well have been the pointed ones which I already have . The slant is too oblique for me ; I can barely catch anything . I just got back from buying a pair -LRB- same brand -RRB- that I could inspect before purchasing ; less slant and work well .
 I have plenty of Tweezerman tweezers , these are by far the worst . The product was as described , but as far as tweezers go stay away if you 're using these on yourself -LRB- especially if you have fine hairs -RRB- . It requires a lot of pressure to grab the hair , and it 's really difficult and uncomfortable to do it on yourself . I 'd recommend every and any other model of Tweezerman tweezers over these .
 Tweezerman makes great tweezers but these are not very good . They break the hairs instead of pulling them out . No bueno .
 I have many Oxo products including the older version of this dishwashing brush . The new one has a removable/replaceable brush which I thought would be nice . But the brush often comes off . Needs some tweaking before I 'd recommend the new version .
 I paid $ 6 for this product , and that was too much.The beard trimmer has a flimsy trimmer guard . This can lead to inconsistent trimming of the beard / goatee . The trimmer guard can not be removed , so do n't even think about straightening your sideburns with this device ! This thing is made of cheap plastic and takes a single AA battery . It whines like it is running out of juice , and I tried two different new batteries.The nose/ear trimmer is unimaginably worse . The `` light '' on this guy might as be an `` on/off '' indicator light . It does * not * light up your nostril ... or anything for that matter . This also takes a single AA battery . This device is also made of cheap plastic , but until its bigger beard trimmer brother , this nose trimmer has a * plastic * cutting `` blade . '' That 's right ... plastic . It actually performed well when I used it on ear/nose hair , but I doubt it will last long with the plastic blade.The carrying bag is OK . Low quality , but it holds the pair nice and snug.In summary
 Tried to contact seller several times . Was unable to . Would not do business again with him .
 Overpriced tube that you can get cheaper at other locations . Works very well of course , Also the product image does not match the products physical appearance .
 I really wanted to like this product because it is far more affordable and comparable to the other major Greens supplement out there . The price is great , the ingredients are high quality , the vitamins/minerals/ingredients are great and in good numbers , but the awful taste leads to me staring at the huge jar and praying that it will eat itself and disappear off my countertop so I do n't have to take it or feel guilty for letting it go to waste . After hearing that the taste was sub-par , I thought `` I 'm a man , I 've eaten dozens of gross things , surely I could choke this down before it does me in , '' but I was wroooooong . I set up a well-mixed serving according to the directions and started drinking ... I 'm not 100 % sure what happened next , but it ended up with me coughing , hacking , and dry-heaving at the sink and the rest of the drink going down the drain . I tried milk and juice and it made me consider throwing out the milk and juice so I would n't consider using it in milk or juice again . I stopped taking it after a week of morning self-flagellation , and I finally threw the canister away last week to save myself from further guilt-tripping for purchasing and not using.I 'm sorry Vibrant Health Green Vibrance , but honestly , the price of the other Greens supplements out there completely justifies the higher prices they charge because I can take it every morning and actually enjoy the taste without ending up coughing and dry-heaving the taste of dirt on dirt on grass from my mouth . I will eat crickets , mealworms , and/or grasshoppers much sooner than I will ever try Vibrant Health again.Pro : - Lots of great ingredients . - Every vitamin and mineral you 'd ever need in reasonable quantities -LRB- not overdoing it -RRB- - They list out every ingredient and amount -LRB- no `` proprietary blends '' -RRB- Con : - The taste -LRB- in water , milk , or juice -RRB- makes it nearly impossible to take . - The taste is awful . - The taste is like dirt . Rolled in a big pile of dirt . Then sprinkled with grass on top . - Dear heavenly beings , the taste.2-stars because it was n't all bad , just the taste . I can not recommend this product to anyone .
 I saw this product in Whole Foods . I checked the nutritional profile , and was satisfied . I pay particular attention to the iron content
 Wow ... I do n't get it !!! After reading several reviews and everyone talking about how great this product is . I rushed to `` Vitamin Shoppe '' to purchase this amazing product -LRB- yeah , right !! -RRB- I drink energy drinks and protein shakes on a daily bases . The taste was bearable like any other powder supplement I drink , no big deal nothing to fuss about . However , the benefits that everyone claims are so wonderful . I just do n't get it . I mixed the supplement with 8oz Vanilla Soy milk and a banana . Went to work and felt so fatigue and yawned all morning , my Co Worker asked me `` what is wrong with you '' I took the supplement again the next morning and yawned like crazy again etc. ... This product sucks and I wish I had n't spent my hard earned money on this junk . -LRB- wow 295 viewers rate this almost 5 stars -RRB- I do n't get it ! I read this forum and value everyones opinion like it 's the gospel truth ... I 'm confused .
 Bought this hoping to get some greens into my children 's diet . Could not even hide the taste of new mowed lawn in other foods or drinks .
 This product is not all natural , people with heart problems should be very careful in using this product . I had shortness of breath , tightness in chest and irregular heart beat . made me very tired . This product was not for me and my Dr. said do n't use it or I was going to end up in hospital.Took me over 2 weeks to start to feel good again .
 Updated post : I tried this product because an employee at Whole Foods ranted and raved about how wonderful it was . On top of that the reviewers here did so as well . I was expecting something good , but found NOTHING . I did not experience an increase in energy , my digestive system was the same , my overall sense of well being was not improved , and I did not notice any reaction whatsoever . I have always taken herbs and can tell when something is going on . There was NOTHING going on . I 've since moved on to my Nature 's Secret products , and immediately after only 1 day of use , I can feel them working . Now that 's what I 'm talking about . Give me something I can feel!Original Post : I GAVE THIS ONE STAR BECAUSE OF ALL THE RAVE REVIEWS THAT MADE IT SEEM LIKE IT WAS SO AMAZING . I HAVE BEEN USING IT AND HAVE NOT NOTICED ANY DIFFERENCES IN THE WAY I FEEL . I KNOW OFTEN TIMES WITH VITAMINS AND THE LIKE YOU WO N'T NOTICE ANY DIFFERENCE , BUT EVERYONE WAS RAVING ABOUT HOW THEIR ENERGY AND DIGESTIVE SYSTEMS SHOWED MARKED IMPROVEMENT AFTER USING THIS . I FELT EXACTLY THE SAME .
 I have finished half of a 720 grams -LRB- 25,4 oz . -RRB- jar and noticed that this product -LRB- version 10.1 -RRB- has 16.4 mg . of iron per serving . In my opinion , this is far too much iron for an adult male . I dumped the remainder on my compost pile . I understand they may have reduced the iron level in the newer version ??
 I finished the 60 day supply and did n't really notice any great benefits from it . It tastes awful unless you mix it with Apple Juice and water . Typically it would make me have to go to the bathroom pretty shortly after . Other than that , it was pretty expensive and I did n't feel much impact which was disappointing after reading all of the great reviews . I tend to eat pretty healthy though so maybe it works for those who do n't like their veggies ??
 I bought this product because it was the highest rated amongst the green drink powders on amazon.Firstly I will say that the taste is horrible , and with products like this that is expected and acceptable , but this one seems to be particularly bad.Secondly I will say that it does not seem to be affecting me in the way that other products have , the powder itself is more of a dull grey than a vibrant and healthy green , nor does the powder stain a dark green like others I have had . Overall after 2 weeks of consistant use I have experienced no increase in energy or any other benefit.Instead of leaving with a negative review saying how I like other products better without mentioning them like others often do , I will recommend to you NitroGreens by Biotics Research , it is a much better product . Hope this review was helpful to you .
 I have been using Poliquin Primal Greens for the last few months , and I asked a friend for a less expensive alternative . On hisrecommendation , I tried green vibrance . There are tons of great reviews . I do n't get it . The taste was awful . My wife , son and Iall tried this and there was no comparison . So I am returning it . I dont know if this was a bad batch -LRB- thought I doubt it -RRB- , but I cannotunderstand how anyone could stomach this product , despite the health benefits .
 The image for this product shows the larger 22 oz . bottle when they are actually selling the 12.1 oz -LRB- 344 gram -RRB- product . Apparently they also send 16 grams more -LRB- a tiny amount -RRB- with the 344 gram product.This is NOT a good deal - do n't be fooled into thinking you will get the 22 oz . bottle they display.You can find a much better deal .
 I 'm not sure of how much better my body was when taking this , but this stuff tasted NASTY . I 'm pretty good when it comes to food and I 'll eat practically anything but this stuff is off my list for life . One of the few tastes that made me nauseated .
 This tastes absolutely horrible . I mixed it with orange juice and smoothies . I also did n't notice any difference in health or reduction in allergies .
 bought for $ 50 a month ago , now price jumps 16 % to $ 58 , will not but again , this is costing too much , it is like $ 2/day
 I contacted Vibrant Health , the manufacturer of Green Vibrance , and they informed me the current version is 11.0 . Amazon is selling version 10.3 . Version 10.3 contains soy lecithin ! The current version 11.0 contains lecithin from sunflowers , a safe form of lecithin , and no soy lecithin !! Vibrant Health also informed me they do n't directly sell to Amazon and have no idea how Amazon is getting green vibrance ! In the future I am only going to purchase fresh , current versions of Green Vibrance !!! I did an online chat with an Amazon representative and he informed me he has no way of telling what version Amazon is selling today . I bought mine 2months ago and a friend just bought some a week ago and both are version 10.3 .
 I had a similar experience to another reviewer . It caused extremely low blood sugar for me . It was n't subtle at all , made me extremely shaky , mostly in the mornings . I gave it a couple weeks to see if the effect wore off but it did n't . Had a couple times where I was stuck driving and literally felt like I was going to pass out . I 've never had a problem like this before and have felt like that only a couple times . Guess it 's time for a DR checkup , might just be hypoglycemic . Not trying to be dramatic , just sharing the negative effects it had on me.The positives
 I bought this drink more than excited after all the positive reviews that it had received . I opened up my package and mixed a scoop with cold water right away . Taste was bearable but the thought of all the good this could was going to do helped me put that behind me . I did n't notice a significant boost in energy but I felt a little better -LRB- after about 2 weeks -RRB- as far as gastrointestinal issues go . However at about week three this is when i started to experience problems , I began getting a small amount of brain fog everyday around noon , about 2 hours after I would consume my green drink . I shrugged this off as stress and continued to supplement with it regularly . I also began to notice a small uncontrolled muscle movements in my leg when sitting down . This progressed to my arms and other parts of my body . They were small , but they were noticeable . At about the third week the brain fog had increased and the jerking was also progressing . I had made no other changes in my diet nor were there any outside factors affecting me . I saw my doctor a few days later and brought a copy of the ingredients . Instantly he knew that this was the source of my problem . He said he could not say for sure which ingredients were causing it but I told him that gluten intolerance runs in the family and he was skeptical about the barley and wheat grass , even though Green Vibrance claims to be gluten-free . Being a previous nutritionist he said that harvesting the wheat grass could determine if it could contain gluten , since although the leaves do not contain gluten , there must be a guarantee that the leaves have completely matured , using up all the protein that the gluten intolerant are sensitive to in order to ensure that the product is completely gluten free . He said that certain extracts could possible be causing neurtoxicity and ataxia , and that certain herbs like ginko biloba can lower things like the seizure threshold , already damaged by the immune response to the gluten , which could be causing the muscle jerking . Now I have to discontinue immediately , a total waste of money and pay to get an EEG in a neurology . I am all for this product for people that it works for , just because careful of these products that `` seem too good to be true '' , because they might just possibly be . One more note , after looking at several of the reviews I was curious as to the validity of all these reviews and wanted to see what other reviews people had posted throughout Amazon . I can positively say that over 90 % of the reviews were the first reviews of the reviewer , which leads me to be a little skeptical . This is MY first review but I feel I am giving a little more insight rather than `` THIS PRODUCT WORKS '' or `` THIS PRODUCT SUCKS '' . Take what these reviewers say with a grain of salt , it costed me money and part of my health but I plan to move on with a positive attitude . HAVE AN EXCELLENT DAY : -RRB-
 I am a person who leads a very healthy lifestyle . I ca n't even begin to choke this stuff down no matter what I mix it with . It has by far the grossest aftertaste EVER ! It may be good for you ... if you can find a way to ingest it . I definitely can not . Do n't waste your money , it smells gross , it tastes worse and it wo n't do anyone a bit of good if it stays in the container it was purchased in . YUCK !! I do n't even think it deserves one star . So annoyed that I wasted my money .
 smell bad and taste awful . I could not sleep well at night after having this product after dinner . quit it .
 I am still awaiting any immense benefits , but the only way I can drink this is in orange juice while holding my nose . It 's been just over a week , so I 'll be happy to give further updates and let you know if I get use to the awful taste . Rating is based on taste alone . After my first try , it sat for two weeks before I was brave enough to try again . Hopeful : -RRB-
 I 'm in my fifties and am pretty average with few exceptions . One exception , though , is that I tend to experience the side-effects of medications rather severely . Therefore , I seldom take medications of any kind so I am sure there were none in my system to counter act with this product in a negative way . Nevertheless , after a couple of weeks , my navel itched non-stop . I checked myself
 This product probably does all it claims but I 'll never be able to find out because it tastes so bad I ca n't bring myself to finish a glass . I have better chances of winning on fear factor . Good luck with this one fellow consumers .
 This is a great product , unfortunately the seller is suggesting you will recieve a 60 day supply based on the image they 've shown for the product . That would be a great deal -LRB- to good to be true -RRB- instead you 'll only recieve the 30 day supply & two single serving packets . Not any bargin at all in fact when you concider in shipping the price comes out to be higher then most healthfood stores can sell it for . Do n't be fooled like I was . There are better deals on 60 day supplies from other sellers who are n't trying to fool you !
 I 'm hypoglycemic , and I 've learned through experience that there are certain herbs and herbal products that can profoundly affect my blood sugar.There is little clinical study of many herbs , and reliable reporting on side effects -LRB- or even beneficial effects -RRB- is anecdotal . Herb popularity tends to run in fads -- there 's always a hot new herb everyone is enthused about . And the excitement over the new one lasts about as long as it did with the last one.Still , because of the buzz , anything with herbs is considered by most people to be better than anything without herbs . Manufacturers get around the `` what 's hot '' thing by throwing in the kitchen sink -- every herb that sounds good goes in the pot.Unfortunately that just increases the chances that some people are not going to be able to use the product . Or will use it and have reactions or side effects -LRB- or even long term effects -RRB- they do n't realize are coming from an herb or herbs in the product.Green Vibrance happens to be one of those products with a kitchen sink full of herbs in addition to the green foods like spirulina and other beneficial ingredients.I did n't realize this when I took a serving . I had been looking forward to trying Green Vibrance because I had heard so much about it and read so many glowing reviews . A few hours later my blood sugar was way low -- I had the familiar and unmistakable symptoms . I was on schedule with my meals . The only thing I had done differently was try the Green Vibrance.I read the Green Vibrance label carefully and , among the many , many ingredients , discovered the likely culprit -- silymarin -LRB- milk thistle extract -RRB- . I 've had a similar experience with milk thistle before , as well as goldenseal . Do a Google search and you 'll see silymarin has been noted as causing blood sugar drops.I really wish companies and corporations would get past the obsession with adding faddish herbs to every manufactured good out there . If we want herbs , we can easily buy them separately . Or the company could package and sell them as a separate adjunct to the product.For those who do n't have blood sugar problems , Green Vibrance may be as wonderful as many people claim , but I 'll just look for a green drink without all the added herb stuff .
 You know when you eat something that tastes horrible and so you think it is really good for you ? You may feel that way after drinking this . It tastes like you fell into a pile of alfalfa and hay in the barn with your mouth open . We were interested in an alkalanizing green drink product and found this at our local health food store on a shelf `` recommended by Dr. Oz '' . I gave it my best shot , I promise.Luckily we found a better version sold by Tony Robbins that tastes a lot more neutral and includes MSM which was hard to find in a greens drink . We ran out of Tony Pure energy greens drink and a month later I tried the Vibrant Health Green drink again -LRB- we have a whole canister -RRB- . I almost gagged and thought I should share this info with others who want to give their body a maximized chance of being totally alkalanized.A month later , BEING ALKALANIZED FEELS WONDERFUL !! I just would n't recommend this product unless you try a travel packet first . Then you will know if you will continue to drink it .
 This stuff was `` ok '' . Does n't last long but helped with dads arthritis only temporarily . Very temporarily . Sorry , but not too great really .
 I like the size and look of this pill holder , but it broke the second week as one of the tabs fell off . I should have read reviews before buying this . I 'll try the other brand now .
 I had been using a standard sized organizer similar in set up to this , but wanted something that held everything I needed and this seemed like a good buy . Not so , at least for me anyway.Pro
 Due to my disability , I really struggle to open the caps of my medication bottles and I always end up having to ask someone to help me . I like to be independent , so thought this product would be good for me . Unfortunately , it was not . I had problems with opening the compartments in order to get my tablets out and had to ask someone to help me . Since this defeated the point of me buying this product - so that I could be more independent - I returned it back to Amazon . If I had not had this problem with being able to open the compartments , this product would have been ideal . The compartments are very large , and the text is large and easy to read -LRB- even for me with my visual impairment -RRB- .
 This product is cheap . The covers are difficult to open . Do not buy .
 difficult to open each and every day compartment to fill or retreive medicationI would not recommend these especially for elderly
 I own the smaller version of these and was surprised that this one has doors that open from the left . . Being right handed , it makes this more difficult to load . . If your a lefty , you might like these better . .
 My mother and father found it to difficult to use . In their eighties I thought it would keep all of mom 's medications lined up but tey were unhappy and went back to doling out their pills from each bottle when they needed to be taken .
 I bought two of these in late April based on the five-star review . They hold a ton of meds , BUT , the covers to the individual compartments break EASILY . Within the first week of use , a cover on both mine and my daughter 's broke as we were lifting the individual trays out . We are currently using one medi-chest as a replacement for the other as the covers continue to break -- no matter how carefully we handle them . At this rate , we are hoping one of them can be used for a few months while we search for a better case for our meds !!
 The flip-up tabs on one the days came right off after my 3rd time flipping it up . Replaceable , right ? Wrong , that 's assuming the company responds to your -LRB- politely written , I might add -RRB- request to replace one of the sections . They never did . So , this review not only deals with the cheapness of their product , but also they 're lack of customer service .
 I do n't know where Mr. Davis -LRB- review of 2007 -RRB- is coming from in saying that in two years this item has not broken . I used this product for a month or so and already two of the tops have broken off . And its not like I am dropping it from an airplane . I 've been careful . Since the lids are broken I ca n't turn the item upside down now to get my pills out or several days worth of pills fall out and onto the floor . And if you tape the lids back on they do n't stay closed . They are always partly open.Another thing , it might be nice that the individual days come out but on the other hand they do n't stay in when you want them to , they are always falling out , adding to the problem referred to above.I am usually pretty satisfied with products but I have to say that this item is not satisfactory .
 Poor quality , will not last . Opened pkg , very large , lots of room BUT ... one of the lift out sections had problems with the lids , very difficult to open each section , also one of the `` hinges '' on one compartment was severed 3/4 of the hinge . It is now holding together by a tiny bit of plastic . I had already loaded all but the last section with pills . If you choose to buy this check everything first , open and close the lids and inspect carefully and be prepared to return this.I had a smaller one I have used for years , finally one of the latches broke and I thought it was time to upgrade . Do n't waste your money !
 This pill holder is flimsy and is hard to open . I would not recommend it to anyone . Neither would I purchase another one .
 While it 's truly large and has big capacity in each compartment everyone of them is very hard to open and I must push the side to lift the closing cap , it makes thaking the pills a real hellish action and if I could I 'd exchange it immediately with something as big but with easier caps to open , however I do n't trust the buying of another large capacity pills organizer because it 's impossible to tell by looking at the picture if there 's going to be any issue with it .
 One of the compartment doors snapped off after just a few days of use . I will not buy this brand again .
 This is very cheaply made . Two of the doors on the compartments were nearly broken off upon arrival . The other compartment doors are not secure , they would n't stay closed in a purse , for sure . I returned this item . Barely dollar store quality .
 I got a bunch of coupons for Glade products , and since I buy the air freshener and ran out of Air Wick , I decided to give Glade plug-ins a try . This was a complete waste of money . I could n't smell a thing and have no desire to use Glade plug-ins anymore . I will continue to use their Rainshower and other water candles and air freshener . I even like the vacuum deodorizer , but the plug-ins leave much to be desired . I found Air Wick candles with this same scent and they worked immediately .
 I have purchased O'Cedar mopheads for 20 years . They are usually yellow , and much fuller than the blue one I received . The only good comment I have is that there is cloth where there was plastic , so perhaps , this wo n't tear , as the plastic has in the past , necessitating replacement.I am very disappointed in this .
 I should have listened to the other reviewers ' complaints ! I got blue instead of yellow . Have n't even opened them yet , so do n't know if they fit . I 'll be going to a different site for these . Have n't decided yet whether it 's worth the trouble to return them , or just throw them in the Goodwill box ...
 The item pictured is not what I received like the previous reviewer - it 's blue , not yellow - and it is not a ` Every Which Way Dust Mop refill ' - it 's a microfiber dust mop refill that ` fits Every-which-way ' dust mops . Big difference . It 's smaller , not as full - save your money and buy elsewhere , bad selling tactic .
 The picture -LRB- yellow refill for the every which way mop -RRB- is not what you get . You get a blue fuzzy thing for a different mop . Even though I returned it they never changed the picture or description .
 by looking at the picture this what i thought i was buying , well i recieved a blue one , the -LRB- strings -RRB- are thicker not the fine looking ones like in the picture . i have been looking for this replacement ever where.I guess i will just keep looking . The replacement i recieved i could of just went to walmart and bought the same thing , not very happy with what i bought .
 I was disappointed with this product . The tab is broken on one of the days , which makes it very hard to open . Also , the lid wo n't stay closed on another day . Plus , the trays do n't click into the stand , they just kind of rest inside it and slip out very easily . I am returning this item .
 Be careful when you purchase this item . I purchased it to deal with my handfull of nighttime and morning meds . I wrongly assumed that the 2 compartments had separate lids , this was not the case , its just one big lid . This means that you can not just open the pm side and empty it into your hand , you either have to cover the am side with something or pick the pills out.The pods are made of a flimsy feeling plastic . The tabs by which you open the lid are thin , so thin in fact that after filling each pod and using it for 2 days i have already broken 2 tabs.The concept is a good one , there are , however , better ones available .
 I bought two of these for my 86-year-old mother , but I will be returning the product . I liked everything about the product as described , but there was no indication that one lid covered both AM and PM compartments ! This would be disastrous for an elderly person trying to dump out the appropriate meds without mixing up the AM and PM doses .
 Containers too small and do not stay in tray but rattle around . There are lots of other comparably = priced alternatives , including one I bought at my local supermarket . Shoddy and not recommended .
 The biggest problem with this vitamin holder is that the individual cases do n't attach to the base . So if you want to take them all with you , you have to take 7 separate cases along . They should have made them click into the white base . It 's hard to transfer them without them wobbling .
 Listing says `` holds up to 25 pills or tablets '' they must mean pills the size of a grain of rice . I 'd return it but it ai n't worth the trouble .
 The idea is good although other products are more compact.However this product arrived with one of the small tabs used to open the `` pods '' broken.Then other tabs began to break off as I opened each one for the first time.It 's possible to open the pods without the tabs , but the product is so flimsy that I would n't trust them not to open accidentally in my bag.Buy something else .
 Well , I have to say I was a little dissapointed with this item.The seller is fine , shipped it fast , etc. . No problems there.It was just a little cheaply made for being over 6 dollars . The main issue is it the little pill containers do n't stay latched very well . Considering the cost of medication , I really need a container that stays latched , losing meds I can barely afford as it is , is not an option for me.This device only works as a stationary pill holder/organizer , and you better be careful when you pick it up , because they come open VERY easily.Sigh ... I 'll use it until I find something better.I have to put the containers in a sandwhich baggy to be on the safe side . That way when they come open I do n't lose my meds .
 I purcased 4 of these units as they looked like they would do the job . When they arrived , I gave 2 to my sister before I 'd even tried them.I think the design could use some work . I really expected the AM and PM to be seperated and the pills do get mixed up . Next when you open them to fill them the top is heavier and they tip over while filling . I have to go to extra trouble of trying to set up an arrangement where the lids are held in place against a magazine etc before filling.I 'm not happy with this purchase and if I 'd not already opened them and given half of them away I would definately send them back .
 I have only owned this product for 5-6 months and I bought two , ie
 This container does divide pills but the compartments are under one lid so the am and pm pills can easily get mixed up .
 I liked the idea of being able to carry daily pills in my pocket , but I currently have only one pocket-sized container and wanted a few more . This looked like a perfect fit , so I ordered it . I was very disappointed when it came because each container does come out , but is larger than needed and too big to comfortable fit in the front pocket of jeans .
 Again was looking for something smaller to set on my counter . This one opens to both am amd pm pills that the same time . Not useing this at all .
 these are complicated to use and open . had to buy different ones . i gave these to my 2 year old to play with .
 I was excited to get this product after reading the reviews . I had previously used a 7 day , one compartment per day , each connected to the other -LRB- like you would purchase at the drug store -RRB- . Each day I would have to sort out the morning from the evening pills so I was looking forward to the AM/PM pills being separate as well as having one detachable `` pod '' per day . When I began using it , I found the following flaws , which were very annoying :1 . I always load my pills at the beginning of the week like an assembly like . So I lined up each of the pill container pods on my countertop and opened them all . They immediately TIPPED BACKWARDS TO REST ON THE HINGE -LRB- each lid making a 45 degree angle with the countertop -RRB- . This made filling each pod impossible without picking each one up and manually filling one , closing it again -LRB- so they do n't fall out when I set it back down , picking up another bottle of pills , and repeating the process . With my old system , I could open all the days and fill all of them . I ended up trying to prop the back lid against a wall but since they are so slippery and oval shaped , they tended to slide back down -RRB- . THIS IS WHAT SHOULD BE FIXED
 This was purchsed for an elderly Aunt . The exterior of these individual pill boxes is too slippery ; she was unable to hold them and return to the tray . Also , I bought the item because I thought the box lid was separated so that AM and PM could be opened individually . That is not the case ; it 's in one piece . When when opened , the meds could accidentally be spilled into another section . Great concept but needs some modifications .
 Poor product thou company was great . seemed to be a good idea but very tedious in filling . Order was on time . Would order from this company again .
 I purchased 2 of this item thinking that it was a great idea to get medications organized . The items arrived and was very disappointed with the quality . It was so poorly designed that the tiny latch which keeps the container closed does n't work at all . What a total waste of money . Its a cheap piece of plastic not worth the $ 7 + asking price . Do n't be fooled .
 Ordered box of 12 of Surgilube Lubricant to be delivered overseas . Requested for better packing however not done . The entire cost of the goods is around $ 700.00 USD . When the good is delivered , the entire box is damaged and the lubricant are squeezed out of the tube . Was told that they are not responsible for the delivery of the package . Just want to share my experience with this firm . Will not order any product from this firm from here on out .
 This product is clearly listed by amazon.com as the version with the screw-on cap , but I was sent the flip-top version . The manufacturer 's box -LRB- holding 12 tubes -RRB- was clearly marked `` flip cap '' , and that was what was inside . It was inconvenient and cumbersome to have to return it -LRB- but I did get credited with the purchase price when the return was received -RRB- .
 This pillow is soft and sqwishy , but it is too small . Also , there is a vibrator inside that does n't work . I just cut out the battery case and use it once in a great while .
 this is not the fault of Amazon , but the maker . the button never worked for the massage part . we got three and not one worked !
 I was disappointed with this product and returned it . The pillow was way too small for me . The microbeads were few and far between . The massager was alright , but I was very disappointed in the product .
 I had read much about royal honey , how it gives you energy and improves your immune system . I do n't know about the immunity issue , but I was buying it hoping for more energy . This product did n't give me any extra energy and it was kind of expensive as well . I 'd say just use regular honey .
 I dont know what all the other reviewers were raving about . I generously applied this product to my face and while it did feel amazing it didnt suck out all the blackheads as other reviews had stated . My pores did look a little smaller though once I washed it off and my skin was really soft . I felt absolutely no tingling , stinging or burning like some of the other reviewers and it took about 45 minutes to fully harden which is about average for products of this nature . I dont regret buying it , but I probably wouldnt buy it again .
 OUCH !! This stuff kills my skin ! This is the second time I 've used the Truefitt & Hill Ultimate Comfort Shaving Cream , and it is the second time I 've walked away from my shave with a horrible rash on my damn face !! I do n't know what I was thinking giving it a second try.Using this product achieves a result similar to rubbing poison ivy on my face.I do have slightly sensitive skin , so maybe this could work for you . But really
 Rash , redness , stinging , irritation . Hive-like redness all over my face after first use ! Hestinant about the aftershave balm I just ordered from the same company . Beware of product ingredients . You may be allergic!Stearic Acid , Myristic Acid , Potassium Hydroxide , Coconut Acid , Glycerin , Lavandula , Angustifolia -LRB- Lavender -RRB- Oil , Triethanolamine , Sodium Hydroxide , Linalool . Endorsed by the Royal Family . Reptilians from outer space ! Have n't you guys seen V ?!
 This gizmo is a costly dud . The first set of test strips let me use it successfully twice . The machine insisted the rest of the strips had passed the expiration date . They had not . Then the last strip worked . I must have made a mistake , I thought , so I stupidly bought another $ 25 box of test strips . Now , the machine simply rejects the lot number which you must dial in . It will not accept even one of the new test strips . I emailed the company 's `` customer service '' department . They eventually gave me a refund for the second box of strips.Do not even think about buying this thing .
 Just purchased this device . Followed instructions for setting up first test . When I inserted the Calibration key , as instructed , it dislodged the internal connection . The device is now inoperable . Cheap , cheap , cheap ... not worth the money .
 These should be worked on and set up for easy use . You waste a lot of money trying to get it exactly right ... the strip that is inserted is a pain does not connect all the time and then you have to put in a new one . . it is not working with my computer the way it should . . it just quit working -- and now does not recognize it at all . It has been trouble from the word go . . out of 6 strips 2 worked like it said it should . Costly and is Cheaply made with software that does not deliver .
 I wasted alot of money on various test strips and blood collection devices - as well as time talking to customer support . If you want an accurate reading on your cholestorol , DO N'T use this .
 First time I tried to use it , it broke . Customer service mailed me a UPS call tag to send it back for repair , but I have n't had time to repackage , etc and to wait ? to get it back . Definitely not up to par .
 This business that makes this item is out of business . So DO NOT BUY - you will be unable to purchase test strips to use with this item.three minute cholesterol monitor
 This product did work fine until earlier this year when it became impossible to buy replacement strips . I have been contacting Lifestream for several months , by e-mail an phone , and ca n't get a response . I found out last week on a health forum that the company has gone out of business , due to lask of financial backing.Don ' t waste you time and money !
 Thank you for giving me the opportunity to reply to my purchase , l was most disgusted that you could take from me $ 99.00 US dollars for an item that was discontinued the same month l purchased it , as l live in South Africa and my daughter lives in the USA l buy me goods thru her , l tried to get the test strips the same time l bought the monitor and then heard that they were discontinued , to my disgust l was unable to notify them as they were on an answering machine , so as at this time l am a very unhappy customer who feels that it was dishonest of you not to tell me that the lifestream was discontinued but you still took my money .
 It worked a couple of times , if you can call giving numbers that were way off , working.After that , it just did not work at all.The manufacturer wanted $ $ $ to fix it even though it was just a couple of months old.Threw it to the trash . What a waste of money .
 I was incredibly happy to find and `` earth friendly '' alternative to the convenient Lysol and Clorox wipes that I often use . And I have tried other products from this line and really like them . Unfortunately , this product did n't have me singing its praises . In fact , it left me gagging . The product has a terrible smell that lingers on ... and on ... after you use it . Plus , as the previous reviewer mentioned , the container is not well designed and I have had trouble getting the towels out every time . I just bought these and do n't know what I am going to do with the five I have n't opened ! My biggest recommendation is to buy them at a local store first to try them before buying in bulk here .
 Another supplement that may be air in a capsule . i would save your money as this product did nothing then stick on the way down .
 It does not handle the full size tubes that I suspect most folks use . The tube they are showing is a mid size or small size tube . There has to be something better out there for folks that have limited hand function .
 It simply does n't support regular sized tubes of toothpaste because the device is n't wide enough . Do n't buy it unless you have only narrow tubes .
 I was only able to take these pills for less than a week . i notice that my nails did grow fast but the pain and discomfort in my stomach was overpowering . i was not able continue to take the pills .
 I took natures bounty hair skin and nails for two years it worked great until I noticed a huge growth on my skin and it was very infected it was not cancerous I went to the doctor and he send me to a surgeon and five different doctors had told me that it was a chemical in the vitamin to preserve it that caused the growth I had surgery . a year later I tried it one more time just to make sure after two months I had the same growth and infection this time I went to a specialist and he told me the same thing that it was from this vitamin . This vitamin works fast but it is very dangerous over the counter vitamin . If it is not prescribed by your doctor do n't take it
 Well , it cuts hair alright , but it also damages my skin too . I used it one time and it left my skin red and sore for sometime . I would not recommend this to anyone unless I was n't particularly fond of them .
 It 's not much to look at , but the trimmer does a great job of cutting ear and nose hairs very close without pulling . I 've only used it for a short time but so far I 'm happy , and it 's far superior to other rotary clippers used in the past.Update after about 6 months of use
 Searched for Broom/Tool Holders on the internet until I found the one I specifically wanted as pictured from the vendor . Other venders had no such picture . Unfortunately what I got were 10 Broom/Tool Holders but they did not look like the pictured item . Could have purchased the Broom/Tool Holders sent from many other venders.Thus , disappointed the item ordered was not as pictured/what I wanted but will try to make do !
 not happy with my order . It is NOT what I had ordered . I ordered the stay-dry pack with the ties . Since I just had surgery I could n't get out to return my purchase .
 I purchased 2 boxes of alive veggie caps last dec. 9 but until this time I have not receive the said item.Pls follow up .
 Bought these because they were listed for the lowest price out of the sites I had browsed . Well , now I know why . Each one was missing half of the chocolate coating on the bar . That just does n't cut it for me . If I pay for a product , I expect to receive the whole product . Wo n't be buying these from here again .
 The bars were OK I guess . The packaging was not the best and all of the bars melted into one pile of gooey mess . I would not order from here again .
 Incredibly rich and tasty ! Lists lots of protein , so that 's good . But , watch out for sugar overload ! Why it has to contain so many grams of sugar -- for a health bar -- is beyond me . 26 grams of sugar in the Apple Crisp ! OMdiabetes ! To my knowledge , all the Colossal protein bars have extremely high sugar levels . The wrapper is super noisy ; try handling one in the quietness of your home without waking up or disturbing someone ... forget it . Again , on the plus side the bar is really tasty and alleges high protein ; on the down side , sugar quantity is sky high and the wrapper is really noisy .
 I like all kinds of Power Bars , Balance bars , Odwalla , Premier Bars . Just do n't like the taste of Chocolate Chocolate Chunk .
 I am no longer happy with this item as the price has increased by 50 % over the summer.Previously this was a good buy now it is just the same price as you woudl find in your local store .
 I do n't know what the previouse reviewers are talking about . Maybe their bodies are used to eating junk-food . This is my story : Since it takes me a long time on Sundays to drive home to eat from my club 's gym I thought it would be a good idea to buy a protein bar to snack right after working out . Thought it would be more practical than taking a banana in my gym bag . I chose this one from Met-rx -LRB- the only brand the store carried -RRB- becasue it was smaller than the other ones they sold -LRB- very similar composition though -RRB- . I ate one before lunch just after buying 2 x12 unit boxes for a month supply . It tasted like a peanut butter candy , good enough but way too sweet & filling.About half an hour after eating one whole bar I started feeling just aweful . So tired that I thought I was going to faint . I could n't do anything after that I felt so bloated & tired . I went to take a 3 hour nap . Only then I started feeling a bit better . A half an hour later I got diarrhea.Feeling puzzled I look at the labels of the product . No it was not expired but it did have a warning about the symptoms I felt but it talked only about the possibility with excessive consumption , not just one bar.Turns out that the stuff they put to make it sweet is sugar alcohol which is indigestible for human-beings , amongst a zillion other chemical ingredients that read like a chemistry lab experiment recipee.Also , the labelling is deceiving . The bar itself does n't have the nutritioal info , only the box does . The bar talks about zero trans fat , whch I thought meant no bad fat . Turns out from reading the box it has huge amounts of saturated fat -LRB- about a third of the daily value , which is bad for you , especially if you are in a low fat diet to gain lean mass . It talks about just 3 gr sugar , but the stuff has tons of sugar alcohol which is worse & makes it as sweet as a disgusting butterfinger candy bar.The next day I returned the product & exchanged it for some other supplements that did n't contain fat or indigestible ingredients.Conclusion
 I buy these bars locally & have found they are a good source of protein , very filling and I love the tast of the peanut butter crisp . I use them as a replacement for breakfast a few times a week , because I just really do n't like many breakfast foods -LRB- except for the gooey fattening ones of course ! -RRB- . The problem I had with these bars is that they had not been stored properly or they were very old . They did not look right when I opened one , so I tried another & it was the same thing . Dried out & crumbly looking . I returned these to Amazon and got a refund.So , the bars are great , just not good from this supplier .
 I love these bars ... when i purchase them locally . The two boxes that I was shipped were stale or something . I love Amazon and we use it for most everything , but these bars are best fresh from your local stores .
 Ordered in December , but all the bars appear to have melted in the package at some point in their history . They re-hardened in a mixed mess and tasted OK , though , so I 'm not returning them . They 're just really messy and difficult to eat in this condition , so I 'm giving two stars . Check the images to see what my bars looked like .
 I love the flavor of these bars but the three boxes I received were not fresh . In fact , most of the bars had white on the chocolate in places . The bars were not soft . I was disappointed .
 Bought a box of these -LRB- different flavor -RRB- from my local BJ 's and thought they were terrific . Lots of protein and only 9 points on the weight watchers plan . Ordered these off amazon even though they were more expensive because I wanted to try a different flavor . I 've only opened two of these so far , and both were kinda melted then hardened back up , so the gooey creamy stuff was on the outside and the chocolate had a dusting of white specks that usually indicates that chocolate is old . Normally if I open a candy bar and it looks like that I either return it or throw it away , but these are NOT candy bars , and they can be quite expensive . So I ate the first one , and it was ... . just ok . Not horrid , but not great either . Dry , chalky and heavy . -LRB- drink plenty of liquid with these -RRB- Just opened the second one , and it was even worse than the first . It did n't taste right , and I could n't finish it . Probably going to end up throwing most if not all of the rest of the box away . My advice ? Buy these locally -LRB- at BJ 's and Sam 's club they 're about $ 20.00 a box -RRB- , they 'll be fresher and not all melted .
 These bars look decent in theory . Only 1g of sugar , high protein , moderate carbs . You 'd think they would be great for your blood sugar , but they 're not . These bars spike your blood sugar as much as a moderate GI carbohydrate would . I suspect it 's the massive amount of sugar alcohols in the bars . I do n't think I 've ever seen a protein bar with as much sugar alcohol in it as these bars have . I would only use these bars in a pinch if you need some protein to satisfy your hunger , and/or fill your protein needs . As far as this being a low GI treat , forget it . While it looks that way in theory , it does n't play out like that in the body.Lastly , eating these makes my teeth hurt , as if I just consumed straight sugar packets . I 'm not even joking , I can eat a Snickers bar and my teeth wo n't hurt , but these bars make my teeth absolutely ache.In closing , there 's really not much benefit you 're going to receive from these bars , other than satisfying hunger temporarily . They have no nutritive value . Yes , they added some vitamins and minerals to the bar , which are in a highly unusable form -LRB- the kind you 'd find in a cheap Centrum vitamin , which your body ca n't even utilize -RRB- . This bar has no fiber , is loaded with sugar alcohols , is horrible for your dental health , and has denatured , overly processed protein , which I 'm sure ca n't be digested and utilized because of how overly processed it is . This is an `` old school '' protein bar , meaning , it 's been outdated for 30 years . Protein bars of the 2010 's have fiber , superfooods , omega-3 's , isolated proteins , and whole food vitamins and minerals.Met-Rx needs to get with the program here . This is 2012 -LRB- almost 2013 -RRB- . The bar Joe Weider created in the 1950 's does n't cut it anymore , with what we know about health and nutrition .
 Before I purchased a box of this I looked up what Mud Pie is and it sounded good . Upon trying one the strongest taste was coffee and sure enough in the ingredients is `` Instant Coffee '' . No one I spoke to has never heard of Mud Pie being inclusive of coffee . Unless you want a java protein bar avoid this .
 If you plan on keeping your teeth , I would n't recommend buying this product . You 'll practically rip your front teeth out trying to bite off each chunk , and your rear molars will be sore the REST OF THE DAY from the chewing , and that 's from consuming only one bar ! If available , select the choc-choc chunk . It 's tastier and much easier to eat !
 Edible taste , not the best but I would keep buying them if i did n't get the worst stomach ache that leads to to a dirrahea . It is not just this met-rx bar that will do this to you , it is any food with sugar alcohols . All Atkins food is based on sugar alchols such as maltitol and sorbitol . They do not effect your blood sugar like regular sugars do , so the theory is that they dont store fat . Only edible if you are within 20 feet of a clean bathroom . You only have 15 minutes to get to the bathroom . Not Worth It .
 I signed up for the monthly delivery of these bars and was so disappointed with the product . I love Met Rx bars and this price was a great deal and the delivery was a great convenience . Unfortunately whoever provides these bars for Amazon.com does not store them appropriately and they appear to have been melted and cooled a number of times . They are hard as a rock , disfigured and the chocolate covering has turned white in many places . They are grainy tasting and lack they 're original flavor . All three cases I received , three different flavors , where all in the same condition . The expiration date was far in advance so it is not an old issue , just a storage issue -LRB- I work in the grocery business :-RRB- -RRB- I cancelled my subscription immediately . They may be cheaper but it 's worth it to buy fresh ones at the drugstore .
 I have never had anything but great experiences when purchasing something sold by amazon or processed by amazon . This item however was the exception . As another poster noted the product is badly stored . This is by far may favorite flavor protein bar . It tastes more like dessert and is very healthy for you . However , the product must be stored in a very warm warehouse because the bar I opened appeared to have been melted at one time . It was crumbling and unedible . Trust me , save your money on this one . I hate going to stores so getting things through the mail is wonderful , but for protein bars , I may be forced to actually go out and pick these up . I will say amazon accepted my return and credited my account so at the very least I was happy with that .
 We have really enjoyed this product in the past , but the order we purchased from Amazon was dried out and not fresh-tasting . We may give it another try sometime , but for now we 'll try to find it somewhere else .
 Seems when they ship these , they all have melted , the ` cookie ' part has sank down to one side of the bar , and you wonder if they know that you ca n't store these in a 130 degree warehouse.Overall you buy these for something to eat when you want protein/carbs due to training . You can get that from these , but do n't expect great taste . If the whole bar was covered like it was supposed to be , then these would be great . Otherwise 1/5th of the bar is good , the rest is dry and chalky.Eat them if you have too , but otherwise look for something else .
 Ordered two boxes of this , along with another box of peanut crisp , as we normally get this from the Vitamin Shoppe . This was slightly cheaper , well guess now I know why , the product was stale ! Almost chipped a tooth eating the bar . So guess we are going back to the Vitamin shoppe .
 This product was not as pictured , received a spray . Wanted the cream as photo shows . Spray does not work . Drips everwhere
 Sort of weird smell . Does n't do any better than any other lotion or cream for foot care . Would n't buy again .
 We bought this when expecting our first child . It is awful in everyway . First , it is poorly built and is made from very cheap materials . The most important point is that it does not work . All that can be heard is feedback from movement of the receiver . It is impossible to hear any heartbeat . Do n't waste your money on this device .
 I paid $ 50 in a store and its not worth it . As said above you can not hear your babys heartbeat above the gurgling and movements within . I was shocked to find out that for $ 50 i had to go out and buy my own cd player ! t has some headphones that you put on your belly and play music from your mp3 or cd player , but if thats all im getting out of this then the package is not worth it . Shoulda just held my ear buds from ipod onto belly
 We bought just the Bebe sounds monitor early on in our pregnancy and we were not able to hear the heartbeat until the 8TH MONTH ... do n't waste your money .
 These LOOK great on my husband , BUT they are made from cheap plastic . Really , they feel like children 's cheapo sunglasses . The hinges do n't open all the way , and in one month , the coating was flaking off . I went for it , reading the previous raving reviews . I really wanted them to work , because from a distance they look great . BUT , they are cheapo and my husband says they are like looking through a fishbowl . `` Lenses '' are cloudy and plastic . One star for quality . 4 stars for style . 2 stars total .
 Nice looking glasses but a little small for a man 's face I think . But the real problem is right after I cut the tag off and went to wipe/clean the glasses before putting them on , one of the lenses popped right off with no effort . I tried popping it back in and barely was able to get it on but it was fragile , kept popping back off before I got it to settle in , gingerly put in on my eyes but the lens was barely hanging on . Returned the item .
 I wanted to like these . Really nice retro design . But for the price - almost $ 20 with shipping and handling - these should have been higher quality . The plastic is flimsy . Definitely not built to last . My pairs from Walmart and Walgreen 's for $ 10 are actually sturdier .
 poor quality - way over priced - first pair broke within a week - why should they/you care ?
 I used smoke away and after the first 2 or 3 days it started making me sick at my stomach , did the same thing to my wife . After I quit using it we started feeling better the next day , Stick with the patch prescribed from your doctor .
 I would have given this zero starts , but that was n't an option . I tried the smoke away , all the support stuff , the pills , the inhalers , etc. . I could have just as well saved my money and bought Life Savers - they did nothing to curb your desire or withdrawel symptoms .
 Well , I tried this stuff due to all the good reviews which I now realize are fake ! cuz if you search the web for reviews on this product you find those exact same reviews , with the exact same wording !! but sometimes the names are different . so I 'm pretty sure the company who makes this product cut and pasted them into Amazon!anyway the kit came intact , have n't watched the CD yet ; the Formula 1 pills make me sick even just to smell them ! even though I take them with food I feel pretty nauseous an hour later ! and the homeopathic pellets are nothing but sugar !! nothing seems to curb my appetite for cigarettes so I guess it has to be all down to will power !!! I 'm gon na try to get my money back or at least part of it anyway ! since I ca n't even stomach the pills !!! I 'm still on the lookout for some herbal smoking cessation pills that makes cigarettes taste awful . I knew of something like this years ago , but forget the name of the company or if they even exist anymore.anyway to all the rest of you out there
 Late , late late , no bladderwrack i 've seen , i did n't feel comfortable with product , a little afraid to use it so ...
 I actually cut one off the bathroom cabinet because trying to open it the right way was too frustrating .
 The good news about this lock is that there is no way that your toddler will be able to get through them and get into your cupboards . The bad news is there is no way that you will be able to either . These locks are impossible even for adults to open ; we bought two packs and are having to throw them all away . What a waste !
 These things are way too hard to open . You need three hands because you 've got to push two buttons at once AND pull on the zip cord part with quite a bit of force . I 'm replacing mine with a C lock which is far easier to work but still keeps the kiddies out .
 DO N'T BUY THIS IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO OPEN THE CABINETS UP AGAIN ! Impossible to open !
 This lancing device does not work.It does n't bring the lancet out to pierce my finger.I called the seller and they refused to take the item back.Horrible experience and waste of money.Do not buy from these people.Big rip-off !!!
 The cane looks perfect , but the adjusmenet nut was galled so I never used it . It was this way when I received it . I am afraid I may fall if the adjustment slipped.Thanks , Glenn Moberly
 I bought this for my wife . We both read the instructions and tried to figure just why there were so many attachments . We hunt for a AAA battery for it , which was not included for some unknown reason . She tried it . She tried another attachment , then another . Now 20 minutes into the project she picks up a 5 blade razor and in 15 seconds was finished . She packed up the Revlon Grooming System and said `` Return it ! '' Now I am busy hunting for all the packaging bits and pieces . A waste of time and money .
 This is a very nice looking Tie Clip , it has a very nice `` dainty '' chain , if you move around a lot you are sure to break it . My husband broke his right as he was trying to put it on . He got it fixed though . He does n't wear it anymore he is afraid he may break it again . I think if the chain was a little sturdier it would be a great great clip . Now if your just going to sit at a desk and not move around very much it may hold up better , or for the occassional tie wearer . But not for someone who has to get up and down out of a seat and stand all day . Other than that , the tie clip is great !
 May get out the ingrown Hair but you 'll need another tweezer to pluck it out
 This item is not as pointy and sharp as one would think . Actually the heads were kinda blunt . Also they arrived brand new with misaligned heads . Huge disappointment . Returned for refund .
 I thought that these tweezers were ultra sharp ... perhaps a little too sharp . Even when I got the hair perfectly ... the tweezers would act like scissors and cut it leaving little hair left for me to grab . It 's more than a little frustrating . I also found that mine are n't perfectly aligned so even when I 'm right on top of a hair it wont ' grab it because the point is so specific . I think this tool is perfect to dig down to your ingrown hair and try to bring it above your skin surface and then use another pair of tweezers to actually pull it .
 In the past , I 've used a needle for ingrown hairs or regular tweezers . I thought these tweezers would work better but they do n't . These are actually less effective and cause more damage . Because of their thickness , it rips the skin around the hair which can cause scarring more so than a needle and regular tweezers . It 's basically like using a thin nail to dig the hair out or at least that 's what it felt like using them . These were a complete waste of time and money for me and added nothing to the process of digging out an ingrown hair .
 Not the kind of tweezer that gets those little hairs in your magnifying mirroras one reviewer stated . The tip is too blunt for that , at least for me anyway .
 Tweezers are n't the most expensive products you can buy , so for $ 14.99 I kind of expect a quality product that gets the job done.Unlike standard tweezers these tweezers are pretty long and have a man sized large grip which may or may not be to your liking . The tip on the one I recieved had one square sided tip and the other was pointed.The tweezers themselves did the job as advertised , unfortunately after using them for the first time I placed them on the counter , washed my face and in the process of grabbing my towel knocked them to the floor . When I went to pick them up the tips were bent 90 degrees.Now I would n't expect a glass to get dropped from counter height to the floor and survive , but considering the size/weight of these tweezers I kind of expected that they would have made it out unscathed . They are supposed to be made of Stainless Steel yet the tips bent like Aluminum ? I ca n't say I 'm very impressed with the products quality.I also ca n't imagine how a product like this would stand up long term . If a small floor collision can bend the tips that much , common use of the tweezers for ingrown hairs or splinters would cause similar damage over an extended period of time.That said the product manufacturer seems to offer a pretty good gaurentee
 These tweezers are not any better than regular tweezers , it is very difficult to get them to grab the hair , the only thing i accomplished with them is some unwanted cuts and bleeding from trying to grab ingrown hairs . really wish i hadnt bought these .
 These are over priced , they do n't work good . They tend to cut the hair rather than grasp and pull it out .
 I just received these tweezers in the mail and I 'm very disappointed . I bought them to replace an old pair of Tweezerman splinter tweezers that had a true needle point . This new pair of Tweezerman splinter tweezers do not have a needle point ; the tweezer 's point is squared off so they are not sharp enough to pierce the skin and grab ingrown hairs.Also , the contact area when you have the tips pressed together is so small it 's difficult to grab any hair with these making them quite worthless.They are being returned .
 These tweezers seem to have a hard to holding onto ingrown hairs on my neck . As a result they sometimes will clip part of the hair , making it shorter and harder to pull out .
 These tweezers can hardly pull out a hair that is n't under the skin . They can puncture the skin , I suppose , but that is really about it .
 I 'm a male and often have ingrown hairs . I own Revlon tweezers which I purchased long time ago from Target . They work pretty well for most ingrown hair and grab the hair very firm.The problem with Revlon is though that first I have to slightly free the hair from the surrounding skin using a needle or other sharp tool.I purchased the Tweezerman tweezers based on mostly positive reviews , but I was not able to use them for ingrown hairs . The tip is sharp and thin . The tweezers either cut or fail to grab the hair . When I tried harder , they would cut the skin , cause bleeding and make more harm . They are pretty much useless.Unfortunately I missed the window for return .
 It is what it is , but its not worth the price . Tip is already losing its point . I wouldnt recommend it again
 I bought a 2 pack of `` Tweezerman '' it said you can send them back for life to get sharpened . I sent them 4-28 . It 's now 7-4 . Guess I 'll never get them .
 i should have returned these . i do n't like them at all . i love this brand but do n't like this version at all .
 I ordered these tweezers from Amazon . They arrived bent . Without any hassle , Amazon shipped a replacement .
 I need needle point tweezers and that 's what I tought I was getting . These are not what I expected , especially from Tweezerman . I 'm disappointed in these .
 I loved my old stainless steel Tweezerman splinter remover . It was not yellow like this one . This one is not as good .
 For an item that ended up being the same as your department or drugstore offering , it was expensive and nothing more than ordinary . Plus the company took more than a week in an off-season time to ship the tiny item . It is February ... not like Christmas where I would understand .
 Might be a great product . I ca n't be sure . Because , uh ... hello ? ... mine did n't come with any instructions whatsover.I opened it up and I was like , `` ah ... hello ? Where are the instructions ? '' But the Tweezerman Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze did not answer my questions.If anyone knows how to operate it or would consider selling their instructions , I would greatly appreciate it . Until then my Tweezerman Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze is just gon na sit there , not being used , like my box of floss , a bag of onions , and my heart .
 I 've owned several slanted tip tweezerman tweezers , and I love every one of them . The design and construction of the tips is not fine , nor rigid enough to provide a solid pinch on a hair , so it does n't serve the purpose that I purchased it for . It has become more of a craft pair of tweezers for me . Not suitable for ingrown hair .
 and it loses its sharpness fastthey say you can send it in for free to be resharpened but that 's a lot of trouble when the sharpness gets used up so quickly .
 I used these tweezers for a few days before the tip bent and was unusable -LRB- tips would not connect and tweeze anything -RRB- . Pros * was not able to use long enough to really find positivesCons * the sharp tips actually seemed really ineffective when I used them compared to a flat tipped pair . The `` needle thin '' tips made it hard to get hairs . I found that the precision description of these tweezers was hard for me personally to use in reality * the super pointy tips actually poked me quite a bit and I gained a sort of Pavlovian aversion to using them * while using them they fell about 2 feet from the bathroom mirror cabinet to the bathroom counter , bending the tips instantly . After this they would not conform to their normal shape despite my efforts and would not tweeze anything . I may take them up on the replacement but I found them hard to use even when working 100 % as they should.Some people may find great use of these , but prefer the flat tipped/tapered tweezers after using these briefly
 I bought these for removing splinters . The tip is not that sharp , and certainly not what I expected . Good for tweezing brows or something like that , but you should use a more sharply pointed tweezer for removing splinters .
 These tweezers are VERY sharp and seem like they 'd be great at removing ingrown hairs , however they perform about as well at removing tough-to-get hairs as my other Tweezerman tweezers . They 're decent , but not great . They might be really good at removing larger things like splinters , but I have n't had to try that yet . Overall they 're not a bad purchase , just do n't expect anything special as far as tricky ingrown hairs are concerned .
 Point is too thick and not able to grasp a fine hair . This is 4th Tweezerman prodct I have purchased and none have performed as described . I count on brand names to be better , wo n't buy this brand again .
 I idiotically purchased these Tweezerman tweezers because two I already have are useless at removing my very fine eyebrow hairs along with splinters from the plants in my front yard that are native to the Southwest deserts.From my experience with these tweezers , they are not designed for anyone with fine hair that is too fine , for removing splinters from plants that are so unusual as to be rare -LRB- lantana , cactus , etc. -RRB- and/or for those whose skin is unlike anyone else 's on the face of the earth.So in addition to all the run-of-the-mill less expensive tweezers that can be found at drugstores , I now own three types of too sharp Tweezerman tweezers -LRB- recommended by various beauty experts as being the best -RRB- that will rip up my skin without removing facial hair -- especially stray eyebrow hairs -- or splinters.I relied on reviews from various sites , including Amazon , when deciding whether to buy these , as I did with the other Tweezerman products . I 've learned my lesson.I have no clue what to recommend to anyone with very fine hair on their face , especially excess eyebrow hair , looking for tweezers . I 've tried creams and lotions , which burn my skin without removing the hair ; waxing , which inflames my skin without removing the hair ; electric shavers , which do n't remove all the hair ; manual razors , sugaring and so on . I ca n't afford electrolysis so I 'm clueless .
 I have the regular tweezerman tweezers and I thought these would be even better . Not even close . They are sharp , and they will dig into your skin , but unless you get a hair exactly in their very , very tiny grip , you will just have a hole in your face and the hair will still be there . Save your money .
 Let me open this review by stating that my experience with these tweezers and a similar model -LRB- also described -RRB- is not typical of the tweezerman products I 've bought and used in the past . Every other style of tweezer -- point end , slant end , body tweezer -- I 've purchased from them in the past has worked perfectly well . In addition , their customer service is uniquely good . They 'll sharpen your tweezers for free and even pay for return postage ; you just have to pay the postage to Texas.The listed splinter tweezer is a different model from one I used to have . I bought the listed product as a replacement for that first tweezer ; you can read about my experience with that first tweezer below . It 's remarkably similar to the second . The tweezers I got were well-honed along the edges of the prongs . Instead of the ends tapering to a point , though , they were squared off blunt far enough up the prongs , that it made it impossible to do any sort of fine work under the skin . That they were too blunt to break the skin without serious clawing did n't especially matter , because they were also misaligned -LRB- I think that 's the cause of the problem -RRB- , and just cut off whatever hair I might be trying to tweeze , between those really well-honed edges.I do n't dare use it for its stated purpose because it 's liable to cut the ingrown hair or splinter in just the way that makes them burrow for bone like a tree root towards water . I tried using it to yank arm hairs , leg hairs , chest hairs , face hairs , even back hairs and the `` bikini line '' -LRB- too much information ? too bad ! -RRB- region to see if maybe a coarser strand might stand up to the so-called `` tweezers '' . I found that if I could work them just so on a hair of sufficient girth , without applying too much pressure , that I could still yank it . Easier said than done . Maybe a handful actually popped out , out of a half-gross or so of hairs I tried to pop out -LRB- in the name of science , natch -RRB- after having developed the might-work light-touch-and-magic-incantation technique described above . I sent the tweezers back to Tweezerman for a free sharpening and $ 5 realignment to see if it would make any difference . It did -- now that the tweezers have been sharpened -LRB- at least the ends come to a point instead of being squared off -RRB- , all it takes is the slightest contact between the two prongs to cause any hair on my body to go flying off . And it gets worse the closer to the point of the tweezers the hair is grabbed with . So it 's gone from awkward to worthless and possibly dangerous . I finally threw them out.I had another set of ingrown hair/splinter tweezers from them that were practically razor sharp -- perfect for digging out recalcitrant hairs or splinters . It was magic even on prickly pear needles that are as thin as a fiber of fiberglass -LRB- and just as uncomfortable to get under your skin ! -RRB- . Then , after a couple of months of faithful use , they -- referring to another , almost identical tweezerman model -- started to get misaligned . I found this out in the process of digging out a particularly deep ingrown hair -- I was just about to pop it out when I squeezed it with the tweezers to yank it -- but instead of yanking it up over the skin , it cut it in half , even deeper than it was before . Now I 'm going to have to find a dermatologist to get the thing out before it gets infected or painful without leaving a big scar . After that incident , the tweezers kept on snipping instead of grabbing whenever I used them -LRB- not for ingrown hairs unless the entire hair was visible , and then only to pop it out with that dig-under-with-one-fork-of-the-tweezer-and-pry-up trick -RRB- . I sent it in to tweezerman with a note describing the problem in detail the problem and $ 5 for them to bend the thing back into shape if they could tell that 's what was causing the trouble -- but it came back with my $ 5 check intact , a little sharper for the trouble . Now I 'm the owner of a glorified hair trimmer . It 's good for detail work , I guess.Since I started using Tweezerman tweezers I 've never bought another brand of tweezer for any purpose . They 've been durable and , except for all the splinter tweezers I 've had , extremely well-aligned -- suitable not just for stray hairs but lab work too . Come to think of it , anyone who has to tweeze stuff in a lab -- to look at it under a microscope or with a loupe -- or anything else requiring the ability to pick up a precise object at a precise point , these would probably outperform the overpriced lab junk for sale so often from scientific supply stores .
 I was very excited about this product , and Tweezerman products came highly recommended to me . However , I was only able to use this product for a short time . My first problem was that after every in-grown hair was removed , there was a tell-tale scab left behind . I 'm not sure which was worse , the hair bump , or the scab . Secondly , I dropped the tweezers , and after that the precision tips did not meet perfectly , so I had to jimmy the ends a bit every time I used it . I finally had to stop using it altogether after I misused the tweezers to retrieve something at the bottom of a narrow bottle and the tips bent.In the end , I think this is probably a great tool for an `` emergency '' in-grown hair or in the hands of a professional . However , it is not suitable as a primary pair of tweezers or for people who are , like me , a little clumbsy or ham handed -LRB- you know who you are ;-RRB- -RRB- .
 I really was hoping for something very precise . These have a nice point but they are not as small at the tip as I had hoped . The tip is certainly much larger than the Revlon Platinum Tweezer Slant Tip , which I have included in an image next to the Tweezerman - Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze.I am currently using these for crafting , which they are actually perfect for . Anytime I need to grab something fine like a bead or brad they really do the trick . They are also great for small stickers or stamped images or pretty much anything else . If they were advertised for this , I would give them 5 stars . As tweezers they fall a little short.I hope this helps !
 The points allow you to work on exposing in-grown hair . But the tips barely touch so it 's very difficult to grasp the hair to pluck it . There are other Tweezerman products that are more effective but I did n't see them for sale on Amazon . Found one that works at Walgreens -LRB- purple coated -RRB- .
 Tried this for a splinter once and could n't get it to grip at all . I normally love Tweezerman tweezers - maybe I got a defective one ?
 I bought these tweezers to replace my old Tweezerman Splintertweeze tweezers . They are not the same at all . The tips are not nearly as pointed -LRB- too wide to use precisely -RRB- or as flush -LRB- wo n't grasp well -RRB- . I have always sworn by Tweezerman , but it seems like the quality of their products has really been declining lately . Being fairly clumsy I often ruin my tweezers by dropping them , and it seems like each replacement pair I buy is worse than the last . I bought my first Splintertweeze because I was sorely disappointed by a very dull pair of Point tweezers that I bought to replace my old ones , and now this new Splintertweeze is almost as bad as those Point tweezers were ! I am sure that somebody who is used to drugstore tweezers would probably find these a nice upgrade , but if you 're used to Tweezerman quality , beware . It ai n't what it used to be .
 It does n't grasp a ingrown hair at all I have to dig out the ingrown hair with a needle then I can grab the hair with this product . if you are wanting something that can dig the ingrown hair out this would n't be the right product for you , the so called point is n't really a point it 's squared off and just does n't grasp the small hair .
 I resort to a pin and my regular tweezers for ingrown hairs . These are difficult to use and make it easy to stab yourself . Good for other people who can use them - I really wanted these to work .
 i had high hopes for this product after reading that it would be the CURE for ingrowns . unfortunately it didnt work for me at all . it made my skin so dry that it was peeling off and did nothing to help my red bumps or ingrown hairs .
 If you are a woman , the calipers require you to take a tricep measurement of your right tricep . There is no way you can do this by yourself , as you need to pinch the area and measure it at the same time with one hand . Also , it requires you to take all 3 measurements -LRB- tricep , illiac crest and thigh -RRB- because it will calculates a fat % , so it is limiting in that respect . If you want to be more scientific , I would get a manual caliper.It also is set up to measure and store 3 users , which may be an issue if you are training multiple people .
 I was absolutely disgusted when I opened the package , and the supposed `` Improve your measuring skills '' booklet was not included . I also need to mention that the measurements may be close , but the calculation is RIDICULOUSLY inaccurate . I sent a complaint to the company and recieved no response whatsoever . Manual calipers may be less convenient , but at least you can do the math yourself , and come up with an accurate number . Save your money !!
 I bought one last year as it was supposed to be accurate and you could do it yourself . Doing it yourself is misleading as the directions for one of measuring sites for women require you to hold it in your right hand and measure the back of your right tricep . Impossible to do both at the same time . Even with the help of my trainer who is skilled at using calipers it gave widely variable readings and inconsistant results . The feature that takes your % body fat and classifies your level by age never worked . Mine was stuck making the classification by the youngest age group for women . Basically it ignored specific data entered in for age and male/female . I was very disappointed but was fortunate to get my money back .
 I just got one of these at GNC and paid way too much . Its a piece of garbage , Does not work at all . Put the battery in and it is just beeping , flashing OK . Finally after pressing NEXT about 20 times the profile for B flashes . The display does n't work properly and showed from what I could tell a body fat % of 0.00 %
 I was debating between this product and the hand held electronic device , and I chose this because I felt it would be more accurate . I have owned it for 3 weeks now , and I have yet to get a reproducible reading that was accurate . I have watched videos , read the instructions and even called their support number . Generally it tells me I am 1.4 % when I should be around 12 % . The Myotape is great , but I would have been better off with the hand held devise and the measuring tape .
 Very Cheaply built product , I actually bought two and now I do n't have neither of them because they brook after a few times of use and were thrown away .
 I guess this is a case of getting what you pay for . Since I started dieting , I 've wanted to track my measurements and body fat , so I got the fat calipers and measuring tape.The fat calipers do n't seem particularly accurate . Measurements taken minutes apart are very different , and , if you do n't have a lot of fat in an area , it 's almost impossible to pinch up an accurate measurement.As far as the tape measure goes , save some money and just get one from a variety store . It 's very awkward to try and position and close , and , by the time you 're done , you 'd have been able to do the same thing better and cheaper with an ordinary tape from any sewing basket.If you really want to track this stuff , kick in the bucks to get something good , or use household measurements .
 I never had the pleasure to use this device since it never arrived and the vendor made little effort to send me a new one . It arrived at a different location , in a different state , but the seller refused to send me another and made me file a claim for refund through Amazon which was very annoying .
 The problem with this caliper lies not in the product itself but in how hard it is to take consistent measurements . I do n't doubt the caliper 's accuracy , but I 've tried measuring myself over and over and the values I get vary by as much as 15 mm . The instruction manual that it brings is far too basic and does not give a clear understanding of how to take measurements . I believe there are manuals for sale that are supposed to help you get consistent values , but I do n't own one myself . Without such a manual , I would advise you to spend your money elsewhere . Also , the product description states that you can take measurements yourself , but unless you have four arms , it is impossible to do without someone to help you.The Myotape , on the other hand , is very easy to use and will give you accurate measurements every time . It is the only reason I rated this product with 2 stars instead of only one . You are better off buying the measuring tape by itself .
 The battery would n't stay locked in and kept popping out , and one of the buttons on the front broke the first time I pushed it , making it inoperable . Avoid .
 I could n't turn it off and it stayed on until the battery died.The text was barely readable it was so small and so feint that I had to stand by a light source.I ca n't say anything about how it works because I did n't use it much.FatTrack Gold Digital Body Fat Caliper - 1 pc , -LRB- AccuFitness -RRB-
 The display on the device is barely visible when it is even working at all . I ca n't believe anyone would sell a product his bad . Even when I 'm able to squint and see the numbers , it often does n't work . I thought it might be my understanding of the product but even when reading the instructions and following them closely it just does n't work . I would try several times , over and over again and still there is no way this device is working right.Sometimes I 'll get a body fat percentage that I can see , but when I 'm able to repeat the test the numbers are completely different . I either have extremely low body fat or I 'm obese . Makes me wonder if the product is just a random number generator.Do not buy this product .
 I was disappointed with these calipers from the beginning because1 . The readout is very faint , you need good back lighting to read it .2 . If you work with clients it is very time consuming to input the required information for each client . You have to go through a series of pressing SELECT , NEXT , NEXT , Enter age , etc. . It was just very fussy and took a while to get used to .3 . Just when I got used to it . It slipped from my grasp and fell on the gym floor and now it does n't work.Only had it a few months .
 Not a good purchase ! No matter how much you practice , even when you measure the same three specified places over and over you get different percentages . The tape measure works ok , but it is just a tape measure .
 The one I got didnt work ... Its not that precise , and mine only took the measurements , but never gave me body fat % . SInce Im in mexico . . Is complicated to send it back and to get it re-sent to me . THUMBS DOWN !
 Calipers did not function properly . I Immediately contacted the company through their CONTACT US section on their website . NEVER heard back from them . Now I have calipers that do n't work and a VERY expensive tape measure .
 The measuring tape was great . The caliper itself is not user friendly , you need a second person to help out , and each time I pinch my skin I get a different reading , better off using one of the electrical scales , might not be accurate but better than this torture .
 The problem with this caliper , is you get a different reading everytime you measure . Why bother to track your body fat when you do n't even know for sure which reading is the accurate one , or maybe none of them are . I measured over and over again , and not once did I get the same reading . As far as I 'm concerned this was a big waste of money .
 Purchased this product after losing over 100lbs . I needed to get a better sense of my progress on my weight loss program and how much muscle to fat ratio I had after such an extreme and rapid weight loss program . The calipers are difficult to use and often give a different reading each time I test the same site . Often the readings are extremely different and make no sense . An example would be going from 30 % to 11 % fat . Basically it 's a cheap product that will do in a pinch to help with a very , and I mean very , rough estimate of my body fat percentage if used with extreme patience . It will do in a pinch but I suggest purchasing a more reliable , and easier to use product for more money if your looking for a more accurate reading .
 Before I begin this review I have to get this out there , this is my first body fat measuring unit I have used and It is possible that I 'm not utilizing it the correct way . That being said , I read the manual and pamphlet that came with the unit over and over again and looked up as much information as I could online to find out how to get a consistent and accurate reading . So far I have used a ruler to measure from the same spot as much as possible and my readings still can vary 10 % give or take . I feel like my readings fluctuate less the more I use it , but I do n't really think they 're all that accurate , just more of a point of reference . I guess you could say that I feel like I `` got what I paid for '' from this thing . I do n't see many other appealing alternatives out there in this price range , so maybe this is the best you can get for $ 30 . Be prepared to be frustrated in the begin using this thing , because you have to figure out how hard to squeeze the caliper and when to push the button that takes the measurement , this can be tricky . The measuring tape included with the unit is very useful however .
 I bought this hoping to get more accurate body fat measurements . According to multiple measurement sessions I am at a ripped 4.5 % . If that was true I 'd have the abs I 'm working towards . I finally just watched a video on how to measure your skin folds , used my cheap little Accu-Measure plastic calipers , and got a far more accurate reading of 12.5 % . The FatTrack calipers seemed to cut my skin fold measurements in half of what they should be .
 This product is only for those that do n't know anything about body fat or composition . its clunky doesnt work right and calipers are highly inaccurate . dont waste your money like i did .
 wow !!! I should get my money back!The same companies non digital caliper is amazing and this is just as useless!the numbers are never consistent and never accuarate ! dont even dare to buy !!! but the tape is very good . Easy to use and you can measure areas like biceps etc without the help of anyone ...
 the caliper does not even have a cover for the battery . The battery keeps falling out during use which is very frustrating
 This item has already quit working and you can not get an accurate measurement when it was working . If you take 2-3 measurements they are all different and not even close to the others . The tape measure is great but not the calipers .
 The engineer who designed this massager should go back to the drawing board ! Some years ago , Conair made an excellent massager called the `` Body Trainer . '' Mine finally wore out , but it was powerful and could be set at just the right angle to reach sore back muscles and get the job done . This model WM30N has inadequate power , even on high speed . If you reach over your shoulder and press down/massage a sore muscle , the head falls off ! Repeatedly . There 's no `` lock '' to hold it on ; it simply slips over two inner prongs , and as soon as pressure is applied , off it goes . I 'm not going to the bother of sending it back , but it leaves much to be desired .
 I purchased this back massager for my mom after taking in her like for back massagers and having a hot stone massage . Since the hot stone massage packages were expensive and required someone else to help you , I decided to order this hoping it would help her with her back pain.Unfortunately she did n't like the massager and complained that it did n't get hot enough for her and the vibrations were n't very powerful . Now this is completely her opinion . Since she did n't like it I tried it out before I debated whether I would ask for a refund or not . I will admit the copper head seemed warmer than the stone head but neither one felt like it got hot enough to really feel nice on sore muscles . The vibration head , which is the rectangular piece you see , has a soft squish pad on top . Which is nice but the vibrations are n't strong enough to go through this pad , and it does n't heat up either.The product itself comes with three heads , a copper head , a stone head and a massaging head that has a nice squishy pad on its head . The copper and stone head heat up and the massaging head is for the vibrations it does not heat up . One great thing about the massage is its swivel wand . You can manipulate it to reach the middle of your back without stretching your arms all different ways or becoming tired for holding it there.So in our opinion , while this massage was nice and did n't have any faults , it did n't quite give us what we wanted in a massager .
 I am sorry I spent the money its a big rubberband and broke after a few uses . I have actually sent a letter to the company to see if they respond . I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT AT ALL !
 This is a complete waste of money . It is thin rubber , and it broke on me before I even used it once . The company I bought it from claims that it is non-returnable .
 Did not help me ! Tried it , got beat up by my girlfriend . Do not waste your time on this product !
 Do n't buy this product . The battery lasted a few weeks before dying . It also produced a strange tasting residue the seemed to mix with the toothpaste . This product is absolute junk ! Do yourself a favour and get something more expensive and reliable .
 Having had a series of fantastic hot stone massages this last summer , I was hoping to at least approximate that experience at home . The stones in this set are tiny , they retain heat very poorly , and there are too few of them . The massage therapist recommended buying a large set of basalt stones and using a crockpot to heat them , and that 's what I 'm going to do .
 I recently took a course in hot stone therapy . Before I took the course , I looked into this product for use in the course . However , after deciding to go with the one offered by the instructor of the course , I am so glad I did . The basalt stones used in the spa have unique properties that allow them to hold the heat longer and they are made unbelievably smooth in `` nature 's rock tumbler '' , the ocean . If you are interested in this type of treatment , I suggest going to a spa , or seeking out a qualified hot stone therapist , and save your money on that product . The spa may cost a little more , but it will be much more satisfying ! And if you are looking for stones to perform this treatment , go to the beach , and then go and buy an electric roaster !!
 I thought I would get this as a birthday present for my friend . The stones take 40 minutes to heat . Once they are on your body , they become cold in about a minute . This is nothing like hot-stone therapy in real salon .
 I thought that the heating unit was okay . It took a lot longer than I expected to heat up , but when it did , it seemed to do an okay job . The stones however , were WAY too small and very rough . The quality of the stones was of lesser quality than what my husband , and 3 kids , could have picked up on a family outing . I was so excited when I ordered this item , and SO disappointed when I received it .
 I purchased a conair HR10 Hot Stone Spa 10 years ago and loved it ! I still use it with very good results!The hair and nail salon that I go to uses the same hot stone spa with good results . I decided to buy one for my son , because of his complaints of muscle aches . I was sooo disappointed to find that the hot stone spa barely heated to a luke warm . What happened to this product in the last 10 years ?
 This is silly . Remember the old ` pet rocks ' phase ? At least that was meant to be a joke . IF you want hot rocks , dig some out of your yard and boil them in a pan -- do n't pad the pockets of some corporate monolith that invents `` needs '' just to increase their profits.Yeesh .
 I did not receive the After Shave Balm....Pre-shave Oil was received -LRB- I did not want to go to the trouble to send back -RRB- .
 I bought this item to try the quality of it in my line of work thats why i do n't like them . They tear easily and not chemically resistant
 I never received them and the seller asked me recind my comment and he would return my $ $ but never did . Find another merchant !
 You know what they did ? The sent me a box that says Glade Aerosol Hawaiian Breeze 12 9 o.z. cans , and you know what they gave me instead ?!?!? 12 Avon roll on deodorants ! I was beyond angry !
 The first time I received this item , the box was somewhat torn because the aerosol cans were loosely packed . The second order came in a much smaller package , but the cardboard was paper thin . The package bottomed out after I started to walk it back from the post office , so just be wary.But hey , the aerosol smelled nice and even lasted relatively long . I 've recently switched to a solid freshener , because the aerosol sometimes only mixes with bad odors instead of eliminating them . I also have asthma so I think the solid freshener is the better option .
 This stuff smells nice , but the spray nozzle is worthless . All you 'll end up doing is spraying globs of liquid on the ceiling . I thought the first can was perhaps an anomaly , but the second one I tried was just the same .
 We used Glade `` Powder Fresh '' -LRB- PF -RRB- in the vivid blue and white container for years , loved it . Then came the `` NEW Powder Fresh '' , washed out/faded colors on the container matched the product now inside . Undoubtably a formulation by the accounting department . It has more of an odor of swamp gas and Chinese Chestnut blossoms than any talcum I 've ever smelled.I called S.C. Johnson & Co. thinking they 'd run a bad batch . They sent a FREE coupon good for any Glade product . Before I used it I sampled the `` NEW '' PF store product on the shelves and found it was ALL watered down . I left the free coupon for someone to use on another Glade product.Remember when the bean counters at Coke invented the `` NEW Coke '' . If you can find an old can of Glade Powder Fresh with the cheery blue sky and clouds on the can , buy it . If you like the old time talcum smell you 'll be pleased - treasure it - they do n't make it like that any more . PF is now PU .
 All I can really say is this stuff tastes terrible . I 'm not picky when it comes to taste , so believe me when I say it 's bad , it is really bad - worse than original flavored Nyquil in my opinion . It does n't remotely taste like punch in anyway , has a chalky texture , and does not mix well with water -LRB- even when doubling the recommended amount -RRB- . I even tried mixing it with juice and crystal light to mask the taste , but it is so overpowering , even that did n't work . I was only able to use it three times -LRB- each time I had to choke it down and then convince myself not to let it come back up -RRB- before I decided it just was n't worth it . I decided it was better to cut my losses and throw it out than try to stomach it any more . I ca n't say for sure if it works or not , because I could n't bring myself to keep taking it . Instead of boosting my workout performance , Gakic made me nauseas , and made my workouts more difficult.Maybe the pill form would be a better choice than the powder . However ,8 pills at a time seems like quite a bit . If Muscletech is n't willing to spend the time perfecting an aspect like flavor , who knows how much effort was put into formulating the product ? I 'll try something else next time .
 The product was not opened , but it had obviously been damaged at some point the pills had been very roughly handled to the point that they had lost their smooth exterior making them difficult to swallow . If you have difficulty with pills this makes it even more difficult and some individuals might gag on them . A serious disappointment . Caution is advised . Be sure to open this product as soon as you purchase it to insure that it is in the proper condition so that you have an opportunity to take proper actions if it is not in an appropriate condition .
 I got this brand , trying new one 's , to see which one I like best . This one is very , VERY , hard to swallow with a glass of anything . Unlike most of Nature 's Way 's products which I would recommend to others , this one I would not .
 The mask is lined with plastic which becomes hard when it gets cold , making it very difficult to breathe . It also does n't stay on very well , so if you turn your head , it does n't stay on your face . I 've gone back to just using a good scarf and am getting better results .
 Well , i ordered this mask recently . It is not serving the purpose it said . This mask is not able to warm the air . Also , it moisten my eye glasses . I think a muffler will serve the same purpose as this mask . Not worth buying .
 I ordered this item from Top Team Health & was told within a day or two of ordering it that it had been SHIPPED . Two weeks later , I still had not received the product . When I contacted the company , I was told that the product had in fact NOT been shipped & that the person handling their Amazon orders had quit unexpectedly . So , basically , they LIED to me when they told me initially that it had been shipped . Will NEVER use them again .
 Yuck ... this stuff tastes terrible . I have tried mixing it into smoothies , water , fruit juice , coffee and cereal , and no matter how I try , I ca n't get rid of the bitter , dusty taste . I find the taste to be a combination of bitter sawdust , cardboard and nasty herbs , that is impossible to hide in any food . I am sure it is very healthy and good for digestion , but I just can not stand the flavor it adds to foods and beverages . It does not dissolve completely , so anything it is mixed in to becomes extremely gritty . I think I 'll stick to ground flaxseed and wheatgerm to add extra nutrients and fiber to my diet .
 I have never had an allergic reaction to anything I have ingested in my life until Acai berry juice - and two weeks after stopping my itchy hives have n't quit ... I checked the web and others are also having this reaction , so beware !
 I bought this product from another company for my husband . He tried taking it several times , but each time he had stomach cramps and felt like he was getting sick . Then he would have diarhea . So after ruling out that something else was causing his problems , we decided it was caused by this product .
 To say I was disappointed would be an understatement . Unfortunately , Amazon does not provide label information so you do n't get to see what Vitamins and Minerals are actually in the product until you buy it.Instructions say to take two per day . Two of them provide only 10 % of Minimum Daily Requirement of Vitamin E , 25 % of Vitamin B-6 , 465 of the Pantothenic Acid , 17 % of the Calcium , 13 % of the Phosphorus , 2 % of the Magnesium , 3 % of the Zinc and 10 % of the Copper you need every day.The list of Vitamins and Minerals that it does n't give you is long starting with NO Vitamin K , No Selenium , No Chromium , No Molybdenum , No Chloride , No Vanadium , No Boron , No Tin , No Silicon and No Nickel.these are all present in other inexpensive multi-vitamins and Minerals available through Amazon like Nature 's Bounty ABC Plus at $ 6.79 for 100 day 's supply . 100 days worth of Thompson 's would cost $ 8.31 and be missing or have lower amounts of the above Vitamins and Minerals.Of course , more expensive Daily Vitamin and Mineral doses would contain even more of needed Vitamins and Minerals than these inexpensive ones do but many of them are not too much more than these cost .
 This product was fairly expensive and did not perform as well as a Water Pik with the irrigation attachment . It also died within about 60 days . The Water Pik 's die as well but they cost about 1/3 to 1/2 the price and last about 6 months . For my money I was not happy .
 The photo provided is very deceiving - it looks like you are getting 5 PACKS of bags . In fact you are receiving 5 individual bags . I was surprised to receive only five bags for the price charged - making them much more expensive than what I could purchase at a home improvement store or even the grocery store ! Will not make that mistake again . The bags are high quality lawn bags , but I can buy the exact thing -LRB- and same number -RRB- for less than half price at the grocery store .
 didnt read reviews carefully enough . the taste is fake & brutal . never could stand nasty aftertaste . i 'd rather it had no sweetner & i could have used some agave & the taste would 've been much better . i actually had 2 pour my smoothie down th sink disposal . it 's a gigantic container and very expensive.i was relying on company 2 produce a product tht tasted great and would want to keep me returning . apparently , there r enough people who like this taste . i cant even tolerate it . it stays on your palate . i wish good tasting foods would stay on my palate but they dont . they ' r gone in mins . cause they dont hav this crazy aftertaste . $ 30 bucks down th drain . oh boy , i got ta get more careful abt what i buy . i ' v always hated diet drinks & diet foods but didnt realize this would taste so awful but it does.if u ' r doing THAT much exercise tht u need 2 instantly replace muscle tissue i suggest some regular food -LRB- lean meat , yellow , green & red fruits & veggies & some dark beans & whole grain bread . it will taste way better than this nastypowder . eeh . . yuck - if u like it u can hav my share
 I ordered the vanilla butter cream and got vanilla so the order was wrong . And while I will drink it if I have to , there are such better-tasting products on the market , why use this one ? I find myself using all the others I have and reordering those . This one sits on the shelf.You might think it silly to complain about taste when really we take these products to get fit -- but try doing this twice a day and you will eventually start dreading drinking this . We suffer enough in workouts . Why not at least enjoy some of these supplements ?
 I mix Met-Rx Plus with regular flavored rice milk in my blender and pour it on my cereal with if I can get them , fresh red currants and rasberries . I like this product because it also gives me a great amount of calcium.Since red meat is said to be a good source of protein , I do n't have to eat so much meat to get the protein for my weight training workouts . I also have the chocolate powder for my evening meals . Except fo the hassle of washing my blender twice a day , I think I 'll continue drinking Met-Rx .
 This unit is clearly marked 1181 with the drain side on the narrow end ... however they sent 1182 with drain on the long side rendering it totally useless for my applacation ... They noted to me upon my complaint that they do not have nor sell 1181 units ... sent me back my money .
 The Rubbermaid 1181 is a discontinued product and at least Uncle Joe 's admits that 's not what they are offering -LRB- see their comments under `` Featured Merchants '' -RRB- . Presents for you makes no disclaimer but shipped a 1182 which has the drain on the opposite side and as the previous reviewer noted is not a suitable substitution . In either case , false product advertising.Avoid ! 0 stars .
 That is a fantastic product ! I have used it many times before . It has the highest natural aspirin content of any white willow Ive come across before . However , this seller took way to long to send it to me , and when it arrived , the product expired in less then 1 week ! I could not be more upset about spending money and waiting on an expired product !
 Ohk ... my lips recently got sunburned and the few vodka shots i had later surely didnt help things . So now i got painful , dry , peeling lips . I saw this product while checking out at the local walmart and picked it up . I have bought it previously and dont really remember anything good nor bad about it from that time . Anyways , this feels great as soon as you put it on but within a minute it has soaked up the liquid and your lips feel even more parched than before ! Even when you add more right away it doesnt seem to improve . I am extremely disappointed with this product but the price isnt bad at $ 2.49 . Additionally , my daughter , whose lips are not chapped loves it ... go figure !
 I bought these because it looked like I was getting a good deal . When they got here , I noticed they are a couple years old . Disappointing because I bought these for the shelf life .
 One thing I absolutely will not tolerate in a battery is one that leaks . I 've lost a lot of expensive electronics from leaking batteries , remote controls , clocks , blood-pressure testers , radios , etc. . These are items that do n't use a lot of electricity , so the battery never actually stops working . I lost the remote control to an almost new High-Def TV due to a leaky battery and had to replace it at substantial cost.I remember when Alkaline Batteries were first introduced . Finally , I said , a battery that does n't leak . I 've used Energizers exclusively for over 20 years without a single one leaking , until about 5 years ago . Then something changed . Suddenly batteries that still measured good and had years left before the expiration date were leaking . At first I thought it was a fluke . But soon it began to be a regular occurrence . I had to resort to checking all my batteries every 6 months to try to catch the leaky ones , before they caused any damage . This is inexcusable.Could this be some bizarre new marketing campaign ? I noticed Everyready claims their new Lithium batteries `` Do not leak '' . Why would anyone claim batteries do n't leak - if none of them leak ? Could they know they have a problem - and do n't care - to motivate us to buy the more-expensive `` premium '' batteries ? Take this all with a grain of salt . What do I know ? I 'm just some dumb consumer that only wants to buy batteries that do n't leak . Now where did I put that bottle of whiskey ?
 Sure , they 're only batteries . But they 're MY batteries . Packing was completely destroyed . I would not be able to put these with gifts this season .
 For the first time since I was a kid I have had batteries corrode and ruin my equipment . This time it happened to my very expensive Mag-lite 3 Cell and 2 Cell L.E.D. flashlights . These Energizer batteries have `` Energized '' me to never buy anything made by this company ever again . My batteries were part of an 8 pack and the 3 unused batteries in the 8 pack were also corroded.This reminds me of what `` Burgess '' batteries would do to anything you put them in . That company has long since gone out of business.UPDATE : ------- I emailed them about what happened to my flashlights and the rest of the 8 pack of unused batteries . 10 days later via U.S. Mail they did offer to repair or replace them and even included a prepaid label to send my flashlights to them for evaluation . I was able to clean them up enough to get them working again before I received the prepaid shipping label . I sent them another emial that I was able to get them working again and asked for tips on removing the rest of the corrosion . A week later they mailed me a coupon to cover the cost of the 8 pack of batteries , up to $ 15 and a letter from their technicians with tips on cleaning them up further . I am pleased with their response to my problem . Maybe a little scared to use their batteries again but now I know how they honor their guarantee . I will give them another shot . I will give the service department 5 stars and will up the overall rating to 3 stars .
 Be sure to check the expiration date on your batteries when they arrive . I got some supposed to have a 5 year expire date and they only had 3 . AMAZON tried to make it `` right '' and send me some with 4 year expiration dates while allowing me to keep the ones with 3 year expire dates : : : : - CAVEAT EMPTOR
 These batteries are stamped with an October 2012 expiration date so I was not thrilled upon reciept of them . We are using them , so I ca n't really say how long they will last , but I just think its wrong for these sellers to knowlingly sell expired batteries .
 Do not buy this package of eight D batteries . I do n't know how it happened , but half of the batteries were useless , having been badly damaged . If you do order this item , be sure to open the package as soon as you receive it , and check every individual battery to make sure each of them is functional . I waited too long and was past the date for requesting a refund . Lesson learned . Benefit from my experience !
 I put them in my radio and the signal was weak . I took battery out and put it in my battery tester and they read ` Replace ' . The date on the battery reads
 These batteries died quickly even though I bought a name brand . I 've had some off brands last longe than these .
 did n't get what is shown . I received to packs taped together . Same amount of batteries but they had dates from different times ? Guess trying to get rid of the old stock instead of the new bigger packaging .
 The package shipped and arrived within a couple days . The battery package was exactly what you would find in any department store . Expiration date in 2017 . Everything looked fine except for one thing
 Disappointing . These batteries must be seconds as they do n't even last a day in my digital camera -LRB- sporadic usage , not constant -RRB- . I 'll stick with rechargeable ones , thanks .
 I thought this was a great deal for Energizer AA Batteries , buy a 16 pack of AA for $ 12.32 -LRB- $ .77 each -RRB- until I found Rayovac 48 pack for $ 25.30 -LRB- $ .53 each -RRB- . They also come in reclose able package so after you open the pack they do not role around in your drawer . My boyfriend uses Rayovac UltraPro at work , bought them at a contractor supply store.One of my students did a battery test and found all of them work the same . Comes down to price . Sign up for `` subscribe and save '' and get 15 % off too . Because these are $ 25.40 you get Free Freight at Amazon without having to shop for more to hit the minimum.Here is the product link.Rayovac ALAA-48 UltraPRO Alkaline AA Batteries , 48-Pack
 Company sent me a d-cell 4-pack of a no-name brand of batteries . The PLUS side is that they refunded my my money , -LRB- plus shipping -RRB- and allowed me to keep the batetries for their mistake .
 I have been buying items off amazon for years . It pissed me off when I spent $ 10 on these and I got a pack full of batteries with battery acid all over them . I 'm very disappointed in amazon because of this . If you want batteries , do n't get them on this website . You have better luck going to ebay and buying off someone with 1 % positive feedback .
 The batteries seemed to be old or stale . They did n't last very long at all . I used them in my trail camera , which normally is pretty easy on batteries but these were down to 2 bars after a week . I get better results from dollar store brands . Disappointed .
 I was assuming I 'd be getting a single pack of 24-count batteries . Instead I got 6 packs of 4-count batteries , one of which was ripped open and the batteries were moving around freely in the packaging box .
 The package came with a few leaking batteries -LRB- pictures uploaded -RRB- , and what first comes to my mind is that they have been in that package for a long time . I did n't get a chance to test the remaining batteries . The appearance is ok , but I 'm not so sure about their quality once many batteries were covered by a white powder and some viscous liquid -LRB- I presumed is the battery acid leak -RRB- . Lesson learned , next time I 'll consider getting fresh batteries at a local store , where you can check expiration date , package and batteries conditions , etc before you buy it .
 I Ordered Energizer Max batteries - as pictured . I received the Energizer Industrial Batteries that had an Energizer Max sticker stuck on the outside of the box . And the box was cut open - with Industrial Batteries inside . I 'm not sure what happened here , but they were returned .
 Stocking up on batteries and searching for the best bargain ? I suggest you skip this one . I was also looking for a great deal on batteries that I planned on storing for emergency use , this was the best price I could find on 9 volts . When I received the package I checked the date of production ... 2009 . It is now November 2012 so these batteries are at least 3 years old maybe more . From what I have read the life span of 9 volts is about 5 years so these batteries now need to be used up pronto AND I still need to buy more for my emergency stash . Not exactly the bargain I was looking for.If you are using these immediately I have nothing negative to say . In November 2012 this was the best deal I could find on Amazon .
 Just got the 16 pack . Totally ripped open . Batteries spilling all over the box . They are dated to expire on 03-2018 . We 'll see . I 've tested some . They work . But the package looks so old and beaten up that I 'm wondering about the life of these batteries no matter what the expiration date is . Plus , the package contains a little plastic car from the TransFormers movie . A little dated ??????? I 'll post another review if this turns out to be a flop .
 Batteries came in a plastic bag and when I went to place them in the air pump I purchased them for they had very little `` juice '' to them . the company said they tested the voltage and these batteries were NEW but the clearly were not !
 After I ordered these I found that a previous order had batteries that were essentially `` dead '' . Too late to stop this one , althought they were fine . But why buy batteries I have to check individually every time . Not worth the trouble .
 New 9V batteries are supposed to be good for 5 years or close to it , according to Energizer . The batteries sent to me were old , it says right there on the battery they expire in 3 years . I do n't use 9V as often as the other sizes so I might have them for a while therefore I need maximum shelf life . Mostly they will be used in smoke detectors which take a long time to use up a battery . It 's not a good deal if you end up throwing them out before having a chance to use them .
 Unfortunately , 0 stars was not an option . I purchased two 8 Packs of Energizer D Batteries to use in an O2 Cool Camping Fan -LRB- which BTW I recommend wholeheartedly -RRB- . The 1st 8 Pack worked Fine . The 2nd 8 Pack , with six years left for freshness , were dead ... I repeat ... * D * E * A * D * . I placed them in the appliance for which I bought them ... not once ... not twice ... but three times ... each time checking to see that I had installed them properly . Next I installed them in a flourescent lantern ... nothing ... I will not buy Energizer batteries again . I would furthermore fire the Rabbit that keeps on going and will make sure he remains gone from my life .
 Broke in less than a month . Could not be repaired , Hinge was defective .

 Could not even open the bottle - the push-down-and-turn did not work , despite all the efforts . Can not tell how good the actual oil is - but the packaging is not getting passing mark on usability .
 I ca n't really give a good review because I ordered a small , yet received an XXL . Not doing much good for me !
 I ca n't really give a good review because I ordered a small , yet received an XXL . Not doing much good for me !
 though i did not purchase this through amazon , i did get this recently from thw grocery store , and have to admit im really disappointed . i followed the instructions the first evening EXACTLY as instructed with the included paper , and no results . the second day , i brewed just a little longer , still no luck , -LRB- basing this off some other comments from other users here on amazon -RRB- then today i only did 6oz , not 12 as the paper instructs , and even brewed this for 6 minutes . still nothing.i really wanted this to work for me like it has for others , i had heard good things and was so excited , but still no luck . i guess im one of those people this doesnt affect . ill keep trying it daily till i run out , but looks like ill have to try something else.as for taste , its not bad . just tastes like tea leaves , not deliciously fantastic , but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable . good luck to anyone else . hope you have more success with this than i did
 the one i got says `` cleanse '' on the box , I do n't know what it means , but I know that I picked the one that does n't say `` cleanse '' on the box . i 'm all the more angry because that one costs way cheaper . and all the more am i angry because i 'm not going to bother to go through the refund process . plus it took it ages to arrive
 I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about . I followed the directions nothing happened . Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea . On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period - I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened ! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else . Strange .
 I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed . As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen -LRB- my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was -RRB- . Sadly , it was this tea . I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also . It is so gross . I have tried adding honey , drinking it cold , drinking it hot , etc and they all taste horrible . As far as a diet aid , I do n't think so . I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you , possibly . I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen -LRB- and no , I was not on the toilet a lot either -RRB- . All in all , this product was a big thumbs down to me .
 I ordered this product a week ago and I have not recieved it yet . I do n't know where it is . My credit card has been charged and their has been no tea as of yet on my doorstep . I am not happy . I go to the tracking site and it ca n't even tell me where it is . I do n't see a number anywhere to call . I fear I 've been duped .
 I was so hoping to love this product after reading some of the good reviews , however , these made me so nauseous and sick . i do n't think i can ever drink tea again because of how sick these made me feel . It might have just been a reaction to my system , and my system only ... but i 'm throwing my box away !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! : o -LRB-
 I got the tea fast , and followed the instructions , only drinking 1/2 cup , which had no effect on my system , it taste pretty good though .
 about 20 years ago all i would use is tek toothbrushes . i am someone that likes a firm toothbrush , my teeth have never been damaged by a firm toothbrush . tek used to make a quality firm toothbrush that lasted a long time . those days are gone ! i was happy to find out that tek toothbrushes still existed but disappointed when my toothbrush arrived . now it is about the quality of what you would find at your local $ 1 store . firm is no longer firm and it 's not long lasting .
 I 've owned two of these now and both have broken . The first one has an intermittent on-off switch and the second has had a failure in the spring that holds the head on tight.I ca n't see how to disassemble them to fix either.Most Welch Allyn stuff is much sturdier than this
 I was so disappointed to receive this package and see it was the normal shelf size I buy at home at way over the normal selling price . Item was a discontinued item in our store but I did n't realize I was getting one bottle . I normally pay $ 5 and this shipment was $ 28 . Total disappointment and guess I will learn to read the finer print better .
 Tums Smoothie , Extra Strength Antacid/Calcium Supplement 750 , Cocoa & Creme , 60 Count . I looked and looked to see how many bottles of these I would receive for the price . Apparently , only one . I found a bottle of the same thing at Walmart -LRB- finally -RRB- last month for about $ 5.00 . Apparently , the vendor is making a healthy profit on these . I put the Extra Strength orange sugar free Tums on my wish list until I get to Walmart to see if they still have the chocolate Smoothie . You can get 4 bottles of 80 count each of the orange chewables for $ 21.96 . Two stars because of the price .
 I prefer these to the other flavours , but it is not worth $ 20 for one package . You can find these elsewhere for less than $ 5 .
 I love chocolate , so I thought the flavor of these sounded great . Other reviewers say they tasted great . So I purchased them . Um ... GROSS ! They are totally disgusting tasting . I want to gag when I eat them . I gave them two stars because they do the job they are intended to do . But I 'm sticking with the fruity flavored TUMS . I just could n't `` stomach '' these .
 I bought this product for my GF . She has violent reactions to gluten . She took the product as per intructions and we had pizza . At first it appeared successful , no vomiting , no pain or any other symptoms . The next day however things changed dramatically . She ended up with Pneumonia like symptoms for three days and her joints hurt for a week . I feel horrible for putting her through this but maybe I can help someone else . Do n't risk it .
 I never received this product . I ordered it from VitaminLife via Amazon , Amazon charged me for it but I never received any information from the company . Amazon gave me an expected delivery date , but the VitaminLife never contacted me . When the delivery dates passed I contacted Amazon , they told me to contact VitaminLife , which I did . I never heard from them . Amazon ended up giving me a refund without me having to pursue it further . I assumed that VitaminLife contacted Amazon and told them to refund it , I would n't know since they never contacted me . Amazon was great about it though . I have since purchased something called Gluten Digest from a local Supplement store . It works great and allows me to enjoy gluten products .
 The Scunci Steamer is a scaled down , cheaper , and less powerful version of the Shark Steamer cleaner , a model that has its own problems with reliability and customer support . The Scunci Steamer tosses out 1,000 watts of steam , considerably less than the 1,600 generated by the Shark . Both models are flimsy , but the Scunci is especially prone to mishap . I was fortunate enough not to waste my money on it . I had a friend who was not quite that lucky . I observed him use it several times before it ceased working . While it did work , the emerging steam was pitifully weak . Only the must superficial of grime and gunk was removed . Further , the steam leaked out , forcing my friend to wear gloves . The Scunci is not a serious cleaner and neither is the Shark . A vapor cleaner , on the other hand , is more powerful since vapor molecules are smaller and can more easily penetrate entrenched dirt . I have not found any reliable vapor cleaners for less than $ 500 . When I do , I 'll add an addendum to this review .
 Disappointing product . Thought it could perform on tough issues
 Was just trying to be helpful . Sorry about that . I 'll try again . DiMarie posted on BrainTalk Communities at braintalk dot org under her name . She finds her steamer far superior to cleaners like the Shark . You can read what she said by typing 2 words into Google , BrainTalk Vapor
 I ran into a lady on the Net who tried all the different vapor steamers . She paid a lot less than $ 500 and she 's pretty happy . Maybe this will help you . -LRB- ... -RRB-
 It is extremely difficult if not impossible to determine what brush heads to order for your Sonicare toothbrush . The official Sonicare site is n't much help ; they do n't even have very good pictures of their products . I ordered these brush heads , but who knows if they will work . Also , the Sonicare toothbrush that my son uses has a faulty seal where the brush head meets the base , so that gunk builds up in the crevices inside . Looks like the same gunk that happens on the special brush head holder .
 Here are two things Phillips will not tell you about their Sonicare toothbrushes and heads .1 -RRB- The collar that holds the toothbrush to the handle will disintegrate in a couple of months . That 's what prompted this review , because they would not replace mine after it fell apart two weeks after purchasing a replacement.They manufacturer these things to disintegrate so you will continue to buy replacements - planned obsolescence . However , I suspect their China supplier is skimping on the plastic specifications and they fall apart in weeks instead of months . -LRB- Do you think China would really do that ? -RRB- 2 -RRB- UNPLUG your base until you need to charge the toothbrush . If you charge it up overnight , then unplug the base , the toothbrush will work for four brushings per day for about a month . Then , when it signals or stops , plug the base in to charge it.This method will allow your toothbrush to work for five years or longer . If you keep the base plugged in all the time , these NiCad batteries develop memory and will stop functioning after 18 to 24 months.A bonus , if you travel a lot as I do , you do n't have to pack the charger . Just make sure it 's topped off and you 're good for a month 's vacation .
 As a person whose oral hygiene was greatly improved by this product -LRB- much healthier gums and cleaner teeth -RRB- , I have to give Sonicare credit for designing an effective product . I would have given it five stars , except for the insulting price.As a professional engineer , I consider the whole $ 14 per brush-head a slap in the face . I see no reason these brush heads could n't have been designed as simple screw-on plastic heads that would have cost pennies to make , except that Philips could never have charged $ 14 per replacement for small , simple pieces of plastic.Congratulations Philips/Sonicare , you 've succeeded in fattening your wallets at additional , unnecessary cost to the consumer and to the environment . You 've successfully copied the inkjet printer industry 's business model . / golfclapUpdate
 The rating for the over all sonicare brush I would give is a 5 , but why make it so hard to match replacement heads to the unit you have ? My brush says
 Very poor quality equipment . Pieces are not tight fitting and the ear speculums will not stay on the handle . Must send it back for a refune
 I bought this set for clinics during my second year in med school since it was about 1/3 the price of the standard Welch-Allyn set . Being a student on a budget , I figured I trade a bit of quality for some savings and planned on buying a more expensive diagnostic set once I start residency . Perhaps my set was defective , but the light kept flickering due to poor contact of the attachment to the power source . The otoscope and the ophthalmoscope heads have their own light source and the handle uses 2 C batteries . Initially , I thought the batteries I just bought were defective and changed them out , but the problem still persisted . Switching between the otoscope and ophthalmoscope heads was a hassle as well . There 's a tiny pin that you had to screw in to hold the heads in place . I 've dropped that pin multiple times . Not only that , it was more difficult to use than the Welch-Allyn . I would not recommend it for someone just starting out . Also , the speculum is not disposable , which makes it difficult when seeing multiple patients . The Riester set did have more attachments than the standard WA set , but that 's about the only advantage . I ended up returning this and purchased WA , which I 'm satisfied with .
 I got this product to take along with my total body cleanse because it 's made by the same company , and I had heard it is good to get more fiber , especially when detoxing , so as to help absorb the toxins . When I got home , however , after taking fiberSMART for a few days I was looking more closely at the Supplement Facts on the back of the bottle . Truth is this product only contains 1g of fiber per 4 capsules . So even if you take the 12 capsules per day , you 're only actually getting 3g of fiber . WTF !? Just eat a slice of bread and you 'll get more .
 There are .25 g of fiber in one pill and the recommended dose is 4 to 8 pills a day . That is a lot of pills and it only adds up to a whopping 2g of fiber . I took these 8 pills a day for two weeks with no benefit . It was only then I examined the ingredients more carefully . .25 g per pill ?! Preposterous . This product did not help me to go or to become more regular and at $ 14 I am more than annoyed that the description did not include the amount of fiber that is actually in the product . If I had read the fiber content on the bottle when it arrived I would have just sent it back . Silly me . I skipped right over it to the other ingredients . If you eat a piece of flax bread and a cup of yogurt every day you will pretty much have achieved what this product does .
 This cane came yesterday and overall it 's just o.k. Quite light weight to the point of being a bit flimsy . But the problem I had was that I ordered the bronze , paying an extra $ 10 , and found that 6 inches of the front of the cane is covered with a big white sticker . By the time this was removed and the sticky stuff gone , the cane underneath was dark and splotchy looking . Not a good thing when they advertise colors . In calling the company I learned that the sticker was not to be removed , it `` identified '' the cane . And that they `` are n't responsible for what pictures Amazon posts in their sales '' . Just a little warning if you thought you wanted a color - get one that blends with the huge sticker .
 Okay , I got this for my dad to be safer than his regular cane . This is made of cheap metal -LRB- it just has that thinner than average cheapie look -RRB- . It adjusts easily , but the locking screw to hold it once adjusted sticks out a bit -LRB- you do n't see it in the photo but it 's enough to catch on things -RRB- . The bottom plate with the four little legs is a cheap looking piece of metal and it 's not evenly spaced ... the rectangle is `` off '' so it looks funky . The price was right but I 'll likely return and spend a bit more to get a more solid appearing cane . I bought this in black so ca n't report on the other colors .
 Our experience is that people who are rather unsteady -LRB- wobbly -RRB- , like my wife and I , may tend to trip over the base of this cane . For them a walker or rollator would be much safer . Also , the feet on this cane do not sit evenly on the floor , which does n't inspire confidence , although it probably does n't contribute to the tripping issue . We could not recommend this cane for wobblies , like us , and have had to give it a low rating .
 Bought this can because I was having a total hip replacement and can not bend over for to 6 weeks to pick up my cane if it falls on the floor . The only positive thing I can say about this junky cane is that if you are careful with it , it will sort of stand up on its own . There are 4 feet one the bottom that I measured with a level and none of them are level . So when you use it , it feels like you are wobbling . It 's hard enough to have a hip replacement , but to sell a cane with 4 feel that are not level is unconscionable .
 I got this for my mom . It 's completely unusable because the quad base is horrifically uneven . I do not recommend this to anyone unless you want them to fall .
 This cane is GREAT . The price , quality and service excellent . It is reliab le for my 83 years , and very attractive too . It arrived within three days.Joyce
 I bought this item because of its muli use functions ; however it broke apart shortly after purchase . It needs to be redesigned to obtain more stability
 The headline says
 This mirror is well made but the 6x magnification was far too strong for me to get a clear image unless I was 2-3 '' away from the mirror -- to close to be able to apply make-up .
 The size of the mirror is not big enough if using to style your hair . It 's difficult to get the mirror in the right position to see the back of the head . Once it 's in position , the width of the mirror is too small to see well . Also , the suction cup did not always stick well . This mirror is more hassle then it 's worth . But it does work well for putting on makeup . I did like how it expands and folds up for storage . It also came with a bag to keep it in .
 The mirror is excellent - almost too much magnification - but the apparatus that extends and holds the mirror is stiff , not great in the adjustment department , and it is very expensive for what I got , in my opinion . I will be surprised if it will last and work very well for more than a year - used not for travel but in my home .
 I do n't know how the other reviewers gave this item such a high rating , I found it very hard to tell the PH from the color grid , all the alkaline colors are very similar and its very hard to determine exactly what your PH is .
 I did not like this product , directions kind of hard to use , I would for sure try a different product next time !
 The Dispenser Ph Test Strips tested my Saliva at 6.4 PH and the same 6.4 for my Urine , and also tested 6.4 for Deer Park bottled water , my NC tap -LRB- deep well -RRB- water , and the tap water at my 2nd residence in KY. . I also purchased pHion Diagnostic pH Test Strips which measured my Saliva PH as 7.5 , Deer Park bottled water 6.0 , and my NC tap water 7.0 . I believe the pHion strips are much more accurate than the Ph Test Strips Dispenser .
 No , no , no !!! Flimsy , ticky tacky waste of money . I 'd advise you to buythe more sturdy individual test sticks . If you tend to be verybusy -LRB- like me -RRB- but have to keep an eye on your ph -LRB- urine -RRB- 3 or 4 times a day , this roll dispenser is more trouble than it 's worth ...
 It came in the roll of paper and to be able to test it , I have to touch the paper . A couple inches of paper is not an ideal size to test and the reading seems to be inaccurate . My husband and I have the same color reading which I know it is not so . And the color does not match to any of the color chart . I bought this product based on the reviews I red , and needless to say , I regret it .
 I was really excited about this bath tub for my baby . As soon as I was done using it I would either wash it , or let it air dry . Once a week , I would even throw it in the washer . That didnt seem to help at all . I only used the tub for about 3 weeks before I threw it out . I couldnt seem to get the spongy smell out . It was disgusting !
 The hinges on Wednesday were broken upon receipt . All the hinges are flimsy plastic tabs that do n't look like they would last very long . I 'm in the process of returning it .
 I am a foster mother and one of my children takes 5 pills a day at different times , so I thought this was the answer to organizing them . I was wrong . The organizer is difficult . Each of the days comes in a box with 4 different compartments . The morn , noon , dinner , bedtime . These are not marked dark enough so they are hard to read . Each box has a label of the day of the week on it , but only on one side of the box , hence , pain in the but putting them back in the container right . You organize your days by putting the boxes in the box . You have to remove the correct box and open it each time you need a pill , then like a puzzle , put it back in the right spot , with the lettering on top . I would just rather open his pill bottle , it is much easier .
 Purchased 4 of these . . got 4 of the wrong ones . . going to Give them one more shot and reorder and hope that I get the right ones . These seem a bit hard to open as well .
 the containers were too difficult to open . the amount of space was what i needed but we wont be using it daily as hoped .
 This is one of several 7 day and 4 times a day medicine holders that are larger than usual . The chief disadvantages of this particular model are that the lids were hard to open - really tight fit - and the more critical , because of the fact that lids are back to back you ca n't open the lids as completely as I needed when I was trying to fill these containers . We found the large four times a day medicine holders that were in one line worked much better .
 Althought a great idea , with the different colors for each day , the morning noon , etc lables are not easy to see - maybe they should color code the time of day too . also , not easy enough to open for someone with arthritis ... not a good choise for us
 I have experienced problems with Rayovac Ultra Pro batteries leaking . When I first experienced the problem a couple of years ago , I assumed that it was just a bad battery or a bad batch . I understand that no product or manufacturing process is going to be perfect every time . So , I decided to give Rayovac the benefit of the doubt and I continued to purchase their Ultra Pro batteries for my electronics . Since then , I have continued to see the problem happen . It has now happened more than once with AA , AAA , and D cell batteries . I have never had the problem with their 9V cells or C cells , but I do n't use as many either . All of the batteries that failed were well within their expiration period , stored and used properly , and most were purchased at different times . Tonight it was my 3-Cell MagLite - and this is the last straw for me.Rayovac does provide a warranty/guarantee against battery leaks and product damage , but they require the customer to mail the damaged product and the leaking batteries to them . I think it is unreasonable and potentially hazardous to mess around with the corrosive batteries that are leaking in order to package them up for shipping . Warranty or not , with the frequency of failures that I have experienced , I will not be putting Rayovac batteries in any product that I own again .
 After recieving these batteries and then shopping at CostCo I found out I payed 50 % to much for these AA batteries.CostCo 's Kirkland brand AA bateries cost far less .
 None of the batteries work . I tried every single one and none of them could run a remote control . When I put in a new Rayovac I bought at the grocery store it works fine . Stay away from this product/seller .
 I got this little pond thinking it would be a good way to `` get my feet wet '' in the water garden hobby . Quality wise the item is just fine , but in practice it just does n't work well . The small water volume and un-insulated sides with it above ground cause the pond to get way too warm in summer , killing any plants and fish . Also , if you have pets or wildlife , forget it . Water gardens attract animals , and birds land on the edge and collapse the pond , bunnies lean on it and collapse the pond , your dog takes a drink and collapses the pond ... you get the picture.You could line the edges with retaining wall stones , but at that point cost wise you may as well have bought a little rigid pond . But , if you only want it for use in your hoe , and you have no pets , it 's probably a 5 star product .
 These are NOT Mountain Herb , but Original Swiss Herb . If it matters to you - it does to me , significantly - please be aware of that . Twice I 've attempted to order Mountain Herb from Amazon sellers , and both times I got Original Swiss Herb , even though the ad clearly CLAIMS they 're Mountain Herb . The flavor is different .
 I have used magnetic therapy for healing previously and with other items , I have received and been aware of the healing benefits - unfortunately , I did not find that with these particular magnets .
 This scale really is quite poor . I find myself taking an average of 3-4 weighings each time I use it as it varies by as much as 1 Kg . It is neither attractive in appearance , accurate , nor consistent ; and for this price it has no redeeming factor whatsoever.I would definitely recommend against this purchase . I am considering purchasing the Ozeri ZB13 scale to replace this one , as it has MUCH better reviews . Or if other stats beside weight are important to you , consider the Omron HBF500 series for a few bucks more . Note , that I have n't had experience with either of these , but they received excellent reviews on Amazon .
 At first glance this scale looks fairly sophisticated . Looks can be deceiving . I 'm fairly certain that the body fat sensor do n't do anything at all . Why does a body fat measuring device need to know if you are an athlete or what your height is ? If is truly measuring resistance through your body this info should be irrelevant ! What it is actually doing is calculating your BMI . That is completely useless if you want to know your bodyfat percentage ! Do n't believe me ? Change your height ! Your body fat will go down if you say you are taller and will go up if you say you are shorter ! In exact accordance with a BMI chart ! Utterly useless !!! I rated this a two because the scale works very well . People having trouble with the scale must be using their unit on carpet ! That or their 's is defective .
 This scale seemed to work great at first . Then after a week it was saying I weighed 50 pounds more or less than I actually do . After a few days of that it quit working completely -LRB- not due to low battery -RRB- . I have not contacted the company yet but I hope to get a full refund .
 This product was easy to set up , and the scale portion works well . However , those are the only positives.The body fat percentage of the scale does not work . I get different readings each time I step on the scale . One of the reasons why I bought this was because it has an athletic mode , which corrects for the high muscle mass of athletes . Being a collegiate division one athlete , my muscle percentage is higher than that of a normal person . The batteries were also not included , so that added extra expenses.Overall , it was not worth the money I spent on it . If you are an athlete that want accurate readings , do not buy this scale .
 Some days this scale will read the same WHATEVER you put on it.I can step on it with or without shoes , holding books , with wet hair
 I 've had my Taylor scale for several years now . I 'd always felt it was a bit strange with its numbers and that it was `` off '' somehow . Sometimes the numbers would seem too high , sometimes too low . But , I figured I paid a pretty penny for it , so I 'm not going to just toss it out . I thought that I could trust it to at least give me a `` heads up '' if things were changing significantly one way or the other.I lost a significant amount of weight this year . How much ? I 'm not really sure . Why ? Because I weighed myself on Saturday and saw 163.4 . OK , that 's about 2 pounds over my normal , but acceptable for the holiday season . Then I got on the scale again on Monday and it read 178.0 - a nearly 15 POUND weight gain !!! I got on and off the scale dozens of times while trying to hold back tears and every time it came up with 178.0 . I was devastated . I had thought I 'd lost about 45 pounds . Now I have no idea how much weight I actually lost and what my current weight might be . The scale at the gym told me 170 lbs last night ... but even if that 's correct , that 's a 7 POUND weight gain !!! What gives?This scale is a piece of crap . Any device that misses weight gain over a period of time sufficient for the user to gain between 7 and 15 pounds is really a piece of junk . And now I also have the great pleasure of feeling as though I was asleep at the wheel , letting 1/3 of my hard-earned weight loss creep back despite the fact that I weigh myself several times a week.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS SCALE !!!
 Two 20 lb dumbbells weigh 42.5 lbs according to this scale ... most of the time , but not always , occasionally they weigh 41 or 42 or 40 lbs . As the weight increases so does the discrepancy reaching 4.5 pounds for the weight of 150-200 lbs . Enough said .
 I have the original cho-pat , which is wonderful . It is the only product I 've found that keeps all my knee `` parts '' steady and feeling good when I exercise . But the original has velcro that rubbed me the wrong way , so I thought the new & improved version would be better . But this one wo n't stay put - slides down my leg , no matter how tight I make it . I would like to return , but they wo n't take it back . Save your money ... or better yet , buy the original one and modify the velcro so it wo n't hurt your skin .
 I would definitely tell anyone not to buy this product . It was cheap and would n't work properly . I have been trying since I 've bought it to get ahold of someone to return this , with no luck . The directions that came with it was horrible . Only half of it was spelled correctly , and the grammar was horrible . Do not buy this product .
 I went completely numb and was unable to keep it up . It was embarrassing . Also , my partner started to feel numb as well . I would not recommend these .
 It does what it is supposed to do , it prolongs your hardness and creates numbness . This is not for every one , I recommend this to people who has early ejaculation problem .
 These are the worst condoms ever . They made me completely numb and could n't feel a damn thing . Guys if you want to actually enjoy it do n't buy this . Waste of time and money .
 Ok so here 's the deal ... I 'm usually not the one in the relationship who gets off first , and tonight I was in desperate need of a condom and as any 20 yr old I do n't want a baby !!!! Well my best friend swears up and down on this condom and gives me this extended pleasure . Well I think nothing of it , just a condom ... NOT I ended up going for an hour and a half and abs hurting and well after she got off the first time had to go to hand joob ... still did n't work ... I go to the bathroom and try my self ... FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I ca n't get myself , , , , , , needless to say it numbs it WAY too much !!!!! Works if you need that BUT ... . DO NOT USE UNLESS U HAVE A PROBLEM !!!!!!!!
 If you do n't want to feel anything , but want to last then this is for you . Otherwise stick with the other models .
 These are awful . A friend had some so I grabbed one on the way to my girls house . Well I got there and we where all set then I could n't feel a thing . And neither could she . These have a numbing lubricant that is supposed to control climax . Oh it will control it , they control it so well you ca n't come . Skip these go with something else NOT climax controlling .
 I was n't really looking for `` extended pleasure '' but it so happened that i grabbed those.The essence of those condoms is to prolong your pleasure by putting in Benzocaine which numbs guys ' p * n * ses thus making it less sensitive and more difficult to reach ejaculation.Why ? Why would I want NOT TO want feel sex ? That 's all there is to it , the feel.Condoms are also thicker , which makes it quite impossible to tell even if it was IN or OUT . Felt like i was not part of the sex but a side observer.I tried to use them just for pregnancy prevention by putting them at the end , but the time between premature and normal ejaculation is exactly how much the condom needs to make you numb . I just threw them away ... I do want to mention also that before i realized what those condoms do , i freaked out since i thought there was something wrong with me . I would touch it and push it left and right and would n't feel ANYTHING , it was n't part of me anymore . Was ready to go to emergency if i did n't google it ... Do n't buy . Look for alternative . 2 stars because i do n't want to be mean and after all it did prevent pregnancy ... but whatever , i can do it with plastic bag ... am sure it would feel better .
 I didnt have a problem with climaxing too early . I put one of these on in hopes I would last long enough to finish the job but instead made me completely numb so I couldnt keep it up . My partner also said it didnt feel as good to her , the numbing got both of us and I lost all feeling to my shaft . Sex lasted a whopping like 2 mins before it wouldnt stay hard . Waited 5 mins or so then switched back to ultra ribbed .
 I bought the Cryoderm spray because my mother swears by it , but I have n't been nearly as satisfied with it as she is . While a spray can help you reach areas you ca n't as well with a roll-on , it also can make a bit of a mess and get to areas you do n't want it to . But it just does n't work as well as Biofreeze , which I 've gone back to . Biofreeze goes on easily and the scent disappears -LRB- which would be nice for Tiger Balm , which is the best but the smelliest -RRB- , and is a far better product than Cryoderm .
 Horrible product . I 'll never buy it again . I purchased multi-pack and threw the entire lot in the trash after about 5 minutes trying to use the first roll.The adhesive paper has more of an affinity to unrolling and sticking to itself than anything else . The roll was poorly perforated so removing a used strip resulted in little gaps in the smoothness of the roll . This caused it to roll back on itself and proceed to unroll 3 or 4 unused sheets in one single swipe.Before I tried this product I always used Evercare lint rollers . I 'll go back to those rollers as they are much better product .
 As I write this review , Amazon has this item priced at $ 25.98 . The return shipping is prohibitive , so I just want to warn everyone before you make the purchase . Please read.In the past Amazon has consistently offered very competitive , if not the lowest , price on every item they sell , so I bought this item a week ago without doing much comparison shopping.Then I found out that Bed Bath & Beyond sells a package of two 70 counts lint roller at $ 3.99 . It 's one of their everyday low price item . It 's not a weekly special price or a promotional price . You can buy as many as you want.That works out to be 840 sheet -LRB- 12 rolls * 70 sheets/roll -RRB- for $ 23.94 , or 35 sheets per dollar paid . Amazon tries to sell you 672 sheets -LRB- 12 * 56 -RRB- for $ 25.98 , or 26 sheets per dollar paid.By the way , I just checked Warmart 's website . They also offer pack of two scotch lint rollers . Price varies by store , but you would think Wamart wo n't be undersold by Bed Bath & Beyond ... The bottom line is , Amazon is A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE than big box retailers on this item . Bed Bath & Beyond also routinely mails out $ 5 off $ 15 coupons . But even without coupon it 's a no-brainer to buy somewhere other than Amazon .
 Um , this does n't do anything but make your bowel movements green . That is it . Besides making your burps smell like leaves . This only helped my breath on one or two occasions . It does not provide a constant result for my breath.However , I did notice the first couple of days that I took it , my armpits sweated alot less , but all that is gone now . It only worked a short while for meI will be searching for a more effective product that produces lasting results cause this ai n't it .
 In this instance I can honestly say , nothing beats the original produt . The price looks great until you realize you have to take twice as many as you did when you were using the `` Original Body Mint '' . In additiona to the increased intake is the fact that this product did n't seem to work as well either . Sadly I purchased a bulk supply hoping to save some money , -LRB- bad move on my part -RRB- this will be the first and last order of this product . I 'll gladly pay the higher price for the product that does work .
 I been usin this product and honestly I still feel the same I have not felt or seen any difference I tought that this will start working at least with in one week of treatment ti 'll this day I feel the same . .
 This stuff is hard to swallow because it tastes bad . I 'm not sure it 's purpose of deodorizing because I did n't notice any of that . I did notice some deodorizing with powder spirulina , but I had allergic reaction to it as well , so I had to let it go .
 This liquid chlorofresh mint flavore was horrible , smell was terrible , mint flavor just made it worse . it made me want to throw up and makes your teeth green for a long time.i took it for 3 days and it DID NOT HELP AT ALL . SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET THE CHLOROPHYLL PILL . ALSO GET IT FROM A DIFFERNT COMAPANY .
 This did n't work for me . Makes your stomach hurt sometimes . Only good is that it contains some copper . I take it as a supplement . Will not buy again .
 Waste of money . The pills in the bottle smell bad , and it did n't help my bad breath at all . This really sucks ! Any suggestions on what really helps bad breath ??
 I purchased this item over a month ago . This ihas done absolutely nothing for me . No need to purchase again .
 started with just 1 capsule per day , tried for 5 days ... all 5 days been having diarrhea ... like not even funny ... stomach would make loud noises too . I 'm still giving a try to every other day , so will see
 I was hoping this would stop the odor like Nullo does because it is a lot cheaper but it does n't work as good .
 It did n't work . I was and still am so desperate to get rid of my underarm b.o. that I tried about everything that promises to eliminate odor . So far , none has worked . These soft gels actually made my stomach hurt a little , even though I take them as directed . They also turns the feces green , but did n't eliminate the smell or anything . I found no improvement at all =-LRB- . I just want to get rid of my b.o. I 've had it since 15 and now I am 21 and have no life because of it . I guess I will continue to search .
 This product I must say did work . Just not for me . I noticed a change for the better in my breath and my body in general . It 's just that everytime I took them I got horrible cramps . It 's too bad because they were great . Maybe they will work for you .
 I wanted the softgel capsules The picture and description is for the liquid . Makes it hard tNature 's Way Chlorofresh , 90 Softgelso order
 This product is `` Non Continuois '' . I received 50 ft in 3 arbitrary lengths connected only by some flimsy red tape which easily pulls apart and will not hold up to anything . If you need 50 continuous feet do not buy this product .
 The nutrients and health benefit is outstanding in all the regular Emergen-c but I remember from a few years ago that the super orange tasted half like real orange and half like a good artificial orange , like Tang or orange soda pop . It used to be my favorite by far but the orange flavor is now pure chemical orange and there is a strong off flavor that distracts from the main flavor . I 'm giving it 2 stars only because the lemon-lime is definitely worse.I must admit that the super orange still produces the least fizz when mixing so you can mix a larger batch without overflowing the container with foam.The only flavor I can recommend now is the pink lemonade , which tastes good with no off flavor or aftertaste , though I hesitate to call it natural tasting .6 Jan 2013 update : My mom actually still had a bunch of the old formula emergen-C flavors . The old super orange was fine - 3 stars . The new super orange is really awful - 1 star . The only difference I found in the ingredients on the packages was that the old one listed malic acid , orange juice powder , natural flavors . The new one listed natural orange flavors , malic acid , orange juice powder.The new acai berry is still good - 3 stars . The old black cherry heart health was very good - 4 stars - so I 'll try the new one and report back in that product if the new one is also good .
 The recommended daily amount of vitamin C for adults is around 100mg . Multiplying the amount by ten gives no advantage to the body , considering the body 's tissues can not even uptake more than the RDA . There is no clinical evidence of vitamin C , of any amount , as a cure or prevention of any major disease , or the common cold . Its clinical uses are limited to aiding the body 's absorption of iron in the GI tract , and acidifying the urine . Excess doses can also lead to the formation of kidney stones . -LRB- Sources
 I DID NOT ORDER THIS ITEM BUT GOT CHARGED FOR IT ANYWAY . HAD TO CHANGE MY PROFILE TO GET THIS STOPPED !!! VERY UNSATISFIED CUSTOMER .
 Unfortunately it just does n't work . Using conductive gel and electric tweezers just is n't practical . The gel dries out too fast and when it does , it is no longer conductive . If you used it in a high-humidity environment you might a tiny bit more success but still dreadfully unsatisfactory . Finding a standard needle probe to replace the tweezers and gel would probably work . Save your money .
 I bought a five-pack of these at a local Costco and they are just terrible . Being from Minnesota , I am a firm believer in all things made by 3M , but unfortunately these lint rollers just do n't stick . I 'm really confused how 3M/Scotch managed to get these on the market after doing any sort of testing in the field . Their postal tape , packing tape , and every other sticky substance that they make is usually the best on the market . However , these lint rollers fall way short of expectations . The sheets are very hard to tear off and they just do n't grab the pet hair like they should . I have a hound and he is very hairy , but these rollers just do n't grab . What Scotch should have done is used their packing tape that 's the color of masking tape for their lint rollers ! If you buy lint rollers , buy the kind that look like masking tape sold by other companies , as they work WAY better than these . I bought these because they were a good price and will definitely not buy them again . Come on 3M , you can do better than this !
 I have cats . I 've always had cats . I 've always used lint rollers . Our usual roller , something we usually buy at Target , ran out . In a pinch I bought these at CVS , 'cause they were on sale . BOY , do they suck . You pick up more cat hair wrapping a piece of tape around your finger . They 're the lousiest investment I 've ever made and I will never , ever buy them again .
 Scotch Lint Roller is the worst lint roller I have ever used . It does n't pick up cat hair very good , is n't sticky enough . The sheets do not tear off even and it is too pricey . A waste of time and money .
 These rollers kind of defeat the purpose . I am constantly ripping off sheets because it appears to have little pick-up ability . Does not pick-up pet hairs very well . Now I am stuck with a box of these . I will never buy this brand roller again . The rollers from Jos. A. Bank have the best pick-up I have found .
 These do not fit my rollers , they are waaaay too big and do n't even stay on . They are supposed to be REFILLS , so I expected them to fit on the rollers I have , but NOOOOOO.I do n't even know , yet , if they will pick up cat hair because they are almost impossible to use .
 I purchased this for my 4 year old thinking it would be a great nightlight . Not a good idea for young children because the glass ball is not attached and is very heavy . Consequently , it will break things if thrown -LRB- the glass ball will not break or crack very well made -RRB- anyways ... the light projected is VERY dim . It did not project on the ceiling or the walls . Also the sound quality is barely audible . Only two of the six sound was average quality . I bought mine for $ 19.99 and it was thrown away within two weeks . Spend your money on something else ... it just doesnt do the job .
 ALTHOUGH WE LOVED THIS SCULPTURE , THE SOUND PART OF IT ONLY WORKED FOR 2 HOURS . AFTER THAT IT WOULD ONLY GIVE OUT A SICK WARBLE .
 I bought this for my daughter for Christmas . She is a big Hannah Montana fan , and loves the brush . Too bad there is no way to change the head - or even the batteries ! It is less than 2 months old , the batteries are dead . Now it is just more junk for the landfill.The idea of 2 minute brushing and music combined is a great idea . Too bad the company could n't have made it to last . I wo n't be buying another one .
 When I received my order , the bottles arrived empty and the whole carton was wet with liquid . I contacted AmericaRX and they demanded a picture , and gave no apology . Unfortunately , I had thrown the carton away . It would have dried by then , anyway . I would not order this product from this company , or any other product , for that matter ! No customer service !
 I have used this product for years , buying it from different health food stores as well as online . I was very surprised and disappointed with purchase . Although the expiration date was in 2014 the vitamins smelled awful and had to be thrown out .
 This thermometer is a complete waste of money . Used less than 5 times and the battery was dead . Cover would n't open easily and after finally managing to replace the battery , it would n't switch on anymore . Do n't buy this .
 Bought product and checked out good . Like the interface -LRB- color code to indicates high/normal temp -RRB- . A few month later when I needed it , battery was dead . New battery from Radio Shack costed $ 3.25 , which was by the way not available in common stores -LRB- walmart , target , walgreen , etc. -RRB- .
 The battery was not only dead upon arrival but very hard to remove in order to replace it . Poor choice of thermometer ... never again
 My Vicks thermometer arrived with a dead battery . I ordered a replacement battery -LRB- Energizer CR1225 -RRB- and the thermometer then worked fine ... one time . I put it away for a couple of months with the power definitely off ; the plastic sleeve is quite hard , so there 's no chance that the power switch was accidentally pushed during storage . The next time I needed the thermometer , the `` new '' battery -LRB- used just that one time -RRB- was just about dead . The thermometer would turn on briefly , but then the screen would fade out . I should have listened to all of the other reviewers who described severe battery problems for this and other Vicks thermometers . I suspect the small number of reviewers who said `` it 's great '' just got lucky with specific thermometers that do n't have rapid battery drain problems , whereas most of the thermometers have this problem . If you buy one of these cheap Vicks thermometers , be prepared for it to fail very quickly , even with a brand-new battery .
 It did n't get off to a great start with a dead battery.We have an older Vicks V965 Basal thermometer . Basal thermometers are the more accurate version needed for tracking ovulation.So we wanted a spare as a backup or for travel . Fortunately , Amazon had it.Or not . Apparently this is the V965R . This version is not a Basal thermometer . The rapid reading feature advertised might have been a hint , but who would have thought it with the same model number?This thermometer measures by waiting until the temperature reading starts to level off . It 's not clear how level is enough for it , but the times vary from 8-25 seconds and the readings vary by about half a degree , which is very significant when an 0.4 degree temperature shift is normally interpreted to signal ovulation . So our confusion aside , the thermometer is very inconsistent .
 Total rip off . Why on earth would a company put such a lame device on the market ? especially when a parent is desperate for an affordable thermometer , only to be ripped off .
 The main reason this thermometer got 1 star was because it lasted about 20 uses in less than a month and now the thing beeps real long at me when I try to use it . The battery is dying already!Also , the backlight does n't last long enough for me to actually see the measurement taken.The recall information was not there 50 % of the time when I turned it back on.It takes temperatures quick , but that 's about it . Please do n't waste your money on this .
 When the item came , the batteries were already dead . I ran to the drugstore to buy new batteries , but the store did n't carry the correct kind . Even if they did , we could not get the battery cover off . It says to just use a coin , but we did that and all it did was strip the plastic . Both my husband and I tried with various tools , but we could n't open the battery cover . We 'll keep trying , but right now it 's basically a big waste of money .
 Right out of the box , this item would not work and it is an item that is not allowed for return . Thankfully , customer service was able to help with this by giving me a refund . I will NOT be buying this item again . I will find something else to replace it with .
 it did not work . Possibly the battery was dead . I had to send elsewhere for a replacement and as yet have not received it .
 We were in the midst of moving when I ordered this and when I got it , it did n't work . Tried to replace the battery and that did n't help . I may have just gotten a dud so do n't let it discourage you from trying it if there are more good comments than bad .
 I usually check things out on Amazon before I buy them , and sure wish I had done so with this . This thing should be recalled by the FDA . I was in my local drug store and needed a rectal thermometer to monitor my 70 lb dog 's temperature when he was sick . My expectations were that I was purchasing an accurate thermometer with a flexible tip that would give a rapid and more comfortable experience for my dog who is very determined not have his temp ever taken . Instead , this is what I got :1 . Before using it on him , I checked my temp orally 3 times and got a different reading each time , although they were all with a degree of each other . I decided to go ahead and use it as I needed to make certain his temp did n't go any higher .2 . I took his temp , and when the `` beep '' at the end went off , he took off .3 . Even though I knew he had a fever at the vets 45 minutes earlier , the Vicks thing said it was almost 2 degrees below the normal range for dogs .4 . Thinking perhaps I had n't inserted the tip far enough , even though my vet said I only needed to insert it about an inch , I took it again and it was still below normal .5 . I have a BD thermometer with a flexible tip that I use , so I apologized profusely to my dog and used the BD thermometer which showed his temp was 1.8 degrees above doggy normal .6 . I tried to return the Vicks thermometer , but it had to be in its original package . I told them why it was n't in it 's original packaging and was told that because I had used it on a dog , I had voided the warranty . I left it on their counter and went to a different drug store and purchased another BD thermometer for myself.My dog and I are very close , but I draw the line at sharing a thermometer !!! I have since purchased a ear thermometer for dogs which I have validated for accuracy at the vets office when they have taken his temp rectally . They now have me check his temp with it before I bring him in to spare everyone the temperature taking drama . After 6 months of every kind of training approach imaginable , even our trainer said that every dog should be allowed at least one phobia .
 When I went to use it recently , the battery was dead . Had only used it once before.My 2 year had a high fever , and I was left with nothing to check her temperature.I was just about to purchase a new battery , when I read these other reviews , so have just decided to dump it instead.Some companies will stop at nothing to make a quick buck , even at the expense of babies and kids.Next time I will avoid Vicks , and find something a little more reliable .
 This thermometer never gives the same reading twice , and the temperatures can vary by quite a large margin . You simply can not depend on the thermometer to tell you if you have a fever or not . I wish I could still get one of those old-fashioned mercury thermometers -LRB- the kind you have to shake down -RRB- .
 The product comes with battery exhausted , and it is really hard to unlock the battery cover , so I have not got chance to use the product so far .
 From the first use out of the package this item has been ridiculouslu inconsistent and inaccurate . Will give me readings of 95.1 and then minutes later will read 97.4 , 97.9 and then 98.8 . This is a coomplete waste of money and actually quite dangerous if you need to know if someone is running a fever . Scary .
 I like the idea of a quick , inexpensive near-instant thermometer . But after using this several times , both healthy and sick , it has never registered above 98 degrees . Repeated readings in a short time resulted in significant variations . Now , sick and feverish , I find I am at 97.8 , while the old mercury thermometer has me at 101 . Not the diagnostic tool I had would depend on .
 When we 1st purchased this thermometer the battery was dead even before we used . The second time round , the battery lasted no more than 10 uses and it was out again . The 3rd time lasted about 12 uses . It 's now dead again.According to specification under the instructions , the battery life isstipulated at more than 300 measurements or approximately 2 years ofusage . we are very disappointed with the product due to this reason . Other than that , I loved the big read out and colored back light .
 Another Vicks thermometer . And still more junk ! It dies very fast . And changing batteries does n't work . Please do n't buy a Vicks thermometer .
 This is my first Amazon review after being a loyal customer for years . However , seldom you come across a products that is so clearly broken , It has compelled me to write the review.Do not buy this product - It DOES NOT measure temperature with ANY accuracy - I got 97.4 , 99.7 and 98.1 when regular instrument shows 99 . I returned first one and tries second piece - Same exact problem!To me selling this product is a fraud . I am henceforth skeptical of Vicks as a brand . They must have poor quality control .
 I bought this thermometer and used it s few times when the battery died . I went out and bought a new battery and the darned thing wo n't work at all now . 3 or 4 uses for $ 15.00 ??? What a waste of money ! I bought an off brand from a local drug store for $ 3.95 that seems to do the same thing and still works after countless uses .
 I compared this thermometer with a brand new one given to me by a nurse . Professional thermometer read
 I have had this thermometer for a while now , and I need to be burning up for it to read above 98 degrees . I just tested it against a mercury lab thermometer , and the lab thermometer read 98.6 , but the vicks thermometer read 95.9 . I have always thought it a little strange that it never showed me as normal unless I already felt I had a temperature . This thing is going in the garbage today ...
 Out of the package this thermometer read low -LRB- 96.8 and 97 degrees without the supplied probe covers -RRB- on 2 different human subjects instead of between 97.6 F to 98.8 F expected for healthy humans . Over the course of 15 minutes , using the oral method with one human subject , where the probe was inserted under the tongue with enough force to cause minor discomfort , the readings varied from 96.9 F to 97.5 F on repeated insertions and measurements . Given this , I can not rely on this thermometer to accurately gauge temperature for anyone with illness . More testing is needed , with an accurate temperature reference . However , human trials are the most realistic in terms of intended usage , and this data points to an accuracy issue for the Vicks thermometer . Aside from the accuracy concern , it has nice features such as a flexible tip , acoustic signals , and an easy to read display . -LRB- Following this review , I purchased a German-made Geratherm Mercury-free oral thermometer , initial tests indicate very accurate readings -LCB- 98.2 F for a healthy human -RCB- . The downside to this thermometer is that it requires 180 seconds to read , the upside is that it does not require batteries and it appears to be very accurate . After years of purchasing useless electronic thermometers , I finally have one that is accurate ! -RRB-
 I bought this thermometer for emergencies within the past year and when I was in a panic to check my sick baby 's temperature in September , it did not work . The battery had died before I had a chance to use it ! After the emergency passed , I went to several stores looking for a replacement battery . No one could match it to anything they carried . I found the same Vic 's thermometer in the package on the shelf and could not find a battery type listed anywhere . The pharmacist could not assist me . Tonight with my glasses on and a 8x magnifier , I identified the model , but no battery type . Finally , I tried looking on Vic 's website and still found nothing other than the bad reviews by other people who had similar problems . Rather than waste anymore time and money on this product , I will call this a loss and invest in a different brand thermometer with better reviews .
 After losing our last accurate mercury thermometer -LRB- remember the days when we all had good , accurate , thermometers ? -RRB- we have tried several that are either mercury-free or digital . To date , all have been a disappointment.The Vicks Speed Read was the second type of digital thermometer that we tried , and we purchased two of them . Both were miserable failures at either reading accurate temperatures or even giving repeatable measurements.Typically , a healthy adult should have a temperature of about 98.6 F -- but both Vicks Speed Read Digital Thermometers give initial readings in the 95.0 - 95.5 range . After several measurements over 10 minutes , readings rose to 96 and 97 but never reached higher than 97.3 . Subsequent tests with additional people , times and comparison with other known accurate thermometers confirmed this inherent inaccuracy.Readings on both the Vicks thermometers were neither repeatable or accurate.Because of these failings I strongly discourage the purchase of the Vicks Speed Read Digital Thermometer.Still searching for an accurate digital thermometer ...
 This thermometer is not very accurate . I can take my baby 's temperature 3 times in 3 minutes , and I will get a different reading each time . If she is not running fever , the reading varies greatly each time , usually well under 97 . On a more positive note , when she is running fever , it does seem to be a little more consistent and accurate . It gives a quick reading , and it does n't bother her at all when I take her temperature under her arm .
 Although reviewed as accurate in many sources , this device is both slow and inaccurate . The inability to receive a quick reading will frustrate the user and make the baby very unhappy . Babies do not like to be probed . Be quick about it should be the motto.I strongly advise getting one that reads the temp quickly
 I thought this was really cool at first . Used it about 10-15 times and it stopped working . Got it for $ 10 at Target . Wish I could take it back . I do like the light-up features , the soft stick that goes in your mouth , and the large read-out . If only it lasted longer . Could be the battery , but most of my batteries for any thermometer I 've ever bought have lasted several years before needing to be changed ... even after being really sick for months and having to take my temp several times daily ... so either way , that 's a major inconvenience . I also felt like my other thermometer was more accurate ... I would get several different readings with this one . It boasts 8 seconds and while it is WAY faster than my old thermometer , it 's not 8 seconds .
 This thermometer always gives readings around 96.5 to 97.5 degrees . As such , it is not a usable product . I am going to replace it , hopefully finding something that is accurate .
 Though quick to give a reading , this thermometer is useless . It typically reads one to two degrees low and can give different readings just moments apart . I got sick recently , and quickly found I could n't trust it at all .
 I bought two of these , and they were off by 2 degrees ! And then one died all together within the first week . What a waste of money !
 The thermometer tries to be `` speedy '' and gives faulty readings . If you take three readings in a row , with a minute in between , its reading can vary by an entire degree . I 've NEVER gotten the same reading twice in a row . : - / In order to get a valid reading , I have to take 4 readings and average them . In my opinion , this defeats the purpose of it being `` speedy '' . Go with another brand ...
 Documentation was poor as we needed to change the display from Fahrenheit to Celcius . We finally decided to search the Internet to find the answer . The thermometer was great after that but then when we needed it less than a year later it failed us as the battery had died . We had only used it that first time so we basically only got that one use out of it . When trying to open the battery compartment we were shocked to find that it was impossible to open . We have also read other reviews stating that once opened it was impossible to actually find a replacement battery . Makes a great first impression but does n't weather the storm when you need it later !
 I have a 5 year old , 3 year old and 17 month old . For the past 2 years I have tried to get an accurate reading with this Vicks thermometer and the Safety First digital thermometer . They are both awful ! I thought I would get a quick , accurate , painless reading - not at all ! My kids squirm they ca n't stand the feeling of this under their arm , when I do get a reading it reads a temp . of 97.1 to 98.9 . I know by feeling their forhead they are burning up , complaining of any variety of symptoms from earaches to sore throats or naseau . I 'd just like an accurate reading to now if they have a 101 or 103 fever . Do n't wast your money . -LRB- I end up using a rectal mercury thermometer on my 17 month old to get it right . -RRB- I just read the many good reviews for the Exergen Temporal Scanner Temporal Artery Thermometer so I 'll invest some money and purchase it . Let you know in the future if it is worthwhile .
 According to this thermometer my husband had a temp of 100.8 for a couple of days ... After violent shaking and chills , we finally decided to go to the Urgent Care , they said his temp was actually 104 ! We double checked the Vicks when we got back home -LRB- 5 minutes -RRB- , and yep , it still said 100.8 .
 This thermometer SUCKS !! It takes approximately 5 minutes to give a reading and if your baby moves just a bit , the timer starts over so you 're waiting 5 more minutes , a total of 10 !! And with an infant or newborn you do n't have time to waist on this silly thermometer . My baby hates it under his arms , he squirms and cries , in the meantime I 'm still waiting to get a reading from it !! I would advise parents to purchase a digital thermometer for the ear or simply choose another name brand , this Vicks model needs to be chunked in the river !!!!
 Taste nasty ! Had my child gagging & wanting to vomit . I tried it too and it 's horrible . It 's thick & pungent . EWwW . Throwing it out .
 The ` little ' series is usually pretty good , but this is an exception I 've found . My wife , wanting something less nasty than milk of magnesia to help our 2 year old have a bm , brought this home . `` It tastes like chocolate '' is what she said , trusting the label . Our innoccent son tried it and then choked and threw up . Poor guy . I tried it later ... . man , was it nasty . It says to ` slowly ' administer it to inner cheek . I do n't think many kids would go for this . The only way would be mixing it into something already strong tasting and only a few drops at a time . The best is to modify diet and lots of fluids , but good ol milk of magnesia does the trick when you need it .
 Ricola has changed the sweetener in its products . In the past , the ingredient list included sugar or honey ; now it lists `` starch syrup . '' Because I had used the drops many times in the past with no ill effects , I did not check the label , trusting that the product was the same as it had been . When I became ill with all the symptoms associated with a reaction to corn , I read the label and then contacted the company to ask what kind of starch was used . I received a response that the syrup was `` derived from corn . '' I believe this is deceptive labeling and would advise anyone with a corn allergy not to use this product .
 I thought , per the photo , I 'd be getting 2 batteries , but I got only one , for the price of 5 -LRB- yes other merchants are selling 5 packs for the same price -RRB- . I hope it is worth the price , cz it certainly is n't worth returning
 Waste of money . Very large , no texture , and it 's hardly cheaper than the real brand . Shipping was n't as discreet as I would 've liked , fortunately I got to the mail before the others in my family . The cock rings are VERY uncomfortable , and do nothing for me . Overall , I would not recommend buying this product .
 I read several reviews of this product that say it works wonders and although I only took one dose , I believe that it may in fact work . However , the ingredient list contains 60mg of Tea Tree Oil . Everything I have read about Tea Tree suggests that it should NEVER be ingested . I did a little research and found nothing to contradict that information . Just to be sure , I contacted a trusted herbalist to get a second opinion . She consulted several of colleagues and they all said the same thing ... NEVER ingest Tea Tree Oil . So , although this product may cure your Candida , but it contains an ingredient that if ingested can also be toxic or cause internal bleeding or cause you to lapse into a coma , etc. , etc. , etc. . So , I could n't possibly recommend this to anyone.By the way , I contacted Solaray to ask why they included something like Tea Tree in a supplement . No one ever got back to me .
 A direct quote from the National Institute of Health -LRB- NIH -RRB- website : `` Tea tree oil taken by mouth has been associated with potentially severe reactions , even when used in small quantities . Several reports describe people using tea tree oil by mouth who developed severe rash , reduced immune system function , abdominal pain , diarrhea , lethargy , drowsiness , inflammation of the corners of the mouth , slow or uneven walking , confusion , or coma . There have also been reports of nausea , unpleasant taste , burning sensation , and bad breath associated with tea tree oil use . '' -LSB- ... -RSB- Solaray Yeast Cleanse has 60mg of tea tree oil in it ! I purchased this product based on the recommendation of the `` expert '' at my local health food store . I originally wanted to purchase caprylic acid and oil of oregano -LRB- which I knew from my own research that both were good supplements to fight off Candida -RRB- . She told me that the Yeast Cleanse contained several other natural ingredients that were recommended to fight chronic yeast infections , so I took her advice and bought it . Two days after I began taking the capsules I had severe abdominal cramping , nausea , a blinding migraine-like headache , and pain in most of my muscles and joints . I looked up the other ingredients in the capsules and was shocked when I found the information on tea tree oil 's dangers when taken orally.I realize that these supplements are not `` regulated '' in the same manner as other medications by the FDA ; however , for a company to include a known toxic ingredient in one of their supplements is absolutely irresponsible on THEIR part . I will be returning the remainder of my bottle , along with a copy of the referenced website above , and asking the `` expert '' for a full refund .
 I have Candida and was taking this with other probiotics . It says to take 6 caps a day !!! I was taking 2 or three and after a month and a half my boyfriend could n't stand to kiss me . I smelled like horrible garlic , and we love to eat garlic . Anoher friend said `` I smell garlic '' when I was two feet away from her ! It may work but you wo n't have any friends afterward .
 I took only one dose of this medication -LRB- 2 capsules -RRB- and soon after became incredibly dizzy , and this lasted for more than 24 hours ! I do n't know if it maybe interacted with something I was taking , but this was my experience .
 Hello im a 31 year old man and i have severe bladder pain and frequent urination due to having interstitial cystitis and i have been suffering from this condition for 9 months now and i 've been told by my urologist that there 's no cure or effective treatment for IC but i 've also read online that others have been cured from IC and completely symptom free by taking anti-fungal or anti-yeast supplements . So i decided to give this one a try but i was a bit hesitent , because of what i read about the tea tree oil not being safe for consumption but for topical use only . Well i bought it anyways and i tried it for one day cuz i was desperate to find anything that would help me and the good news is that it worked and i immediately felt relief in my bladder just 2 hours after taking the 6 pills as directed by the bottle but the bad news is when my body started processing the ingredients i started feeling a sharp pain in the right side of my body in the kidney area , not a nice feeling and the pain persisted for 9 hours along with mild diarrhea . I 'm definately not gon na use this product again and i do n't recommend it to anyone . I 'm gon na try other supplements that do n't have the tea tree oil in it so that i do n't wreck my liver or kidneys .
 I have taken this product only a handful of times . And ths last time I took before bed and woke up with extreme abdominal pain . It s 3pm the next day and the pain is still persisting . I would never take this medication again as I am nervous I caused some real damage to my system . In so much pain . Nothing is helping right now . Do n't buy this .
 I bought two medium size of this product . One obvieously is larger than the other . Both were too small for me even though I carefully measured my knee before ordering . I had to send them back and bought midium size ACE product from local drug store , which is just right -LRB- size wise -RRB- .
 I ordered a small , and it was too small . I ordered a medium , and it was too big ! I sent it back for a refund . This knee support does not match up in size with the supports from Target or the sporting goods stores . It is better to get one in your city , that way you can try it on , and take it back right away .
 These supports run very large and actually fell off my leg when I attempted to put one on . I ordered two . I would not recommend this product to anyone , and ended up throwing them away . Seller represented that they were working with me , but as it turns out , they did not .
 It provides little protection for your knee . You have to wear other brace or strap to get necessary support .
 I saw this oil on Amazon website , but ordered directly from the supplier , Auroma . Tried it in a cold process soap . It has a very weak fragrance , even when used directly in a massage oil . Now Foods grapefruit oil is much cheaper and way better quality . You can also try the Eden 's brand on AmazonWaste of money . Seek another brand . Also , when contacted , their customer service is very slow to respond , or do not respnond at all .
 I thought this was going to be the greatest . But I was disappointed because of the adjustable frame . On the bottom of the frame it 's difficult to see in the picture , but their are two thumb screws to adjust the bracket up and down so it lay flat on the bed . If you have a foot board which I do most bed do you need to reach way down between foot board and mattress to get at these screws , and the sheets and blankets are in the way . Very cumbersome this way I take it out and put it back under at night thats how difficult these screws are and caregivers have difficult time need to explain how it works it 's hassle . BUT otherwise ! It holds the sheets/blankets well and size is good it 's made well but this was very disappointing . The white cheaper one which I had was easier to use but not as well made as this one .
 I 've only used this a few times so it may not have had time to work , but with the way my hands are IT STINGS SOOOOOOOO BAD !!! It hurts like hell !! Do n't put on open open cracks or sores !!!! You WILL regret it !! By the way , this is NOT a cream . It 's a dry oil . It does soak into the skin fast , but remember it is an oil not a cream !! AND IT HURTS !!!
 I make it short
 This is the most uncomfortable ankle support I have ever worn . The hemmed places all around the heal makes it impossible to walk with it on . . And I have fat feet and they swell at times but the part closest to the toe is very loose making it hard to put a sock on so you can give up any chance of wearing this for a walk . . Going back to the hem around the heel , it was uncomfortable and I just had it on with my feet elevated . . So even with no pressure it needs to be fixed . . I would not recommend this product and I regret buying this product . .
 I bought a neoprene one and this one for about the same price . The neoprene one fit well . Although I though I had a big ankle , this was almost big enough to go over my knee . Giving it to one of my `` Really Big '' relatives .
 Just a warning -- strand test with extreme care ! I did n't strand test long enough because I went with the color on the package . My hair is about 5 shades darker now than I wanted .
 I 've used a couple different kinds of mouthguards over the years , and this is the only one I have downright hated . It fit awkwardly , it felt flimsy , it moved while I slept , and then after only a week of using it , I chomped it right in half while I was sleeping . Do not buy this product unless it is a last resort .
 I wore the pre-redesigned version of this night guard for months and when I replaced it with this one , I bit through it in two weeks .
 Had one of the $ 500 grinding guards ... always felt like a tennis racquet in my mouth.Bought both the Plackers and the Sleep Right guards to compare.Sleep Right is adjustable , but abraids my cheek.Plackers can be worn on top or bottom arcade , whichever works better.Plackers is meant to be worn only 3 times , but I 've been using mine for a month , and it 's working great!Definitely recommend the Plackers over the Sleep Right .
 Warning ... The dental guard pictured in this listing is not what the buyer is getting.The dental guard pictured sells for about $ 45 at Walgreen 's , so I thought I was getting a good deal when I purchased it from this seller.However , what was delivered was the cheaper model that sells for $ 25 at the pharmacy.I have submitted a request for the seller to fix the problem , and just maybe , this was an innocent mistake and this transaction was merely an isolated incident.However , if the seller denies to replace the product , I will add to this comment and recommend that you buy the other , cheaper model.I 'd like to clarify that this is not a negative endorsement of the sleep right product itself.This is more a warning to buyers to hold off from their purchase of this product until it is concluded as to whether the seller has made an innocent mistake or if the seller is deceiving amazon 's customers .
 The flexible nature of the product created a gagging sensation , and no matter how it was adjusted always felt like I would swallow it during the night . I had a difficult time even trying to figure out which end went up & which went down . I tried it for one week , then gave up . I went back to the solid units which you boil . Do not believe the hype on these . When I tried to return it I got the run-around and when I finally sent it back the company claimed they neverreceived it , so I 'm out $ 39.99 The company is as sketchy as their product .
 I found this product very uncomfortable and difficult to fit properly.It did not stay in my mouth overnight . I would never recommend it .
 The sleep guard did not fit well , I had to mail them back with a refund form , seller never sent a check or process a refund . I have made a claim to Amazon , yet seller said they never gotten anything . It sucked !!!! Will never deal with this companyeven again .
 I really love the design of this product . I have tried many different night guards and this is definitely my favorite as far as comfort . The problem I had was exorbitant cost and durability.I bought this in the first place because my dentist quoted me at $ 500 for an acrylic night guard . Presumably , the Sleep Right would be a better option , but for $ 40 each , they do n't last long . I found that I ground through mine in about 30 days . I would actually give Sleep Right a glowing review if they let you buy the replacement grind pads for a reasonable price or if they gave you a few extra grind pads per pack ... but since you have to buy the entire set with the main piece that holds the pads , carrying case , and packaging , this turns into a $ 500/year investment that is no longer worth it . Like I said , great design , but they are pricing themselves right past the more durable versions you can get specially fitted at the dentist .
 After five or six nights , right after getting used to it , it broke up . Materials are very lousy , and even though it is a good idea , the product is bad , and pretty expensive for what you get in exchange .
 I just bought the new and improved night guard . I can not even sleep with it . the new material is way too hard . I hae them now .
 This guard did n't fit right - uncomfortable , and I found it very difficult to sleep that I had to take it out . Unfortunately , I will have to keep looking but thinking the ones you boil and mold to your teeth would be better for me .
 This is a cheaply made , flimsy product . The one I received has the holes for the width adjustment in the wrong place so the securing pop-up bottons do n't work . The height adjustment for the arms is only for the front of the arms . If you lower the height the arms slope down ! The height of the back of the arms is not adjustable . Very poor design .
 Great idea , but the two I ordered for my wife were not usable because the holes in the bracket to attach the arms were in the wrong place . You could not secure the arms in place at a 90 degree angle and leaving them unsecured would have been unstable for user . I had to send both back for a refund . Really disappointed !
 The product looked great , but after 3 hours of taking off commode bolts , this apparatus would not fit on our toilet -- which was to be used by my elderly father . Since it involves a commode , I assumed that nothing can be sent back , and we were out money . It says it fits all toilets , but not true , and difficult to attach -- which was not mentioned .
 The motor is weak , which means hair gets stuck in the blades rather than being nicely trimmed , and the battery life drops off after a few months to the point where the clippers need to be recharged after each use .
 What 's bad :1 . It has a single wide-blade that is supposed to be used for both the beard and the moustache . Without a narrow-blade it is very difficult to define the line of moustache because the wide blade cuts at un-intended places too .2 . The blade is so weak that it ca n't be used to form the outline of the beard cleanly . Hairs outside the outline of the beard ca n't get a close cut.Why 1 star -- For an important thing like this , one can be either completely satisfied or completely un-satisfied , there ca n't be anything between the two ; nobody likes to spend money and time to settle for something mediocre.Within a week I switched to another trimmer and I like it very much . Its Wahl Groomsman XL2 , I bought it at Walmart . It has dual blades ; and it works great in trimming and removing unwanted hairs -LRB- the only bad thing about this is it is a bit noisy compared to Norelco T765 -RRB- .
 I had the previous Norelco introductory model for about two years . The rechargeable batteries , as others have noted , wore out rather quickly . I only use a trimmer about five months of the year and only a few times a week so I did n't really use the trimmer enough to justify it dying so quickly.Thinking this was all just a quirk , I bought this new model to replace the one I threw out . It was a total waste of money!The biggest issue is the lack of power in the motor . This thing , even when fully charged , will PULL the hair off your face if you trim too quickly . The blades just are n't moving fast enough . If you trim slowly you 're OK . If you 're in a hurry and trim quickly you 're in for a painful surprise . I never had this problem with the previous model or any other beard trimmer for that matter.The second issue I have is with the trimmer head which they supposedly `` improved '' from the previous model . The new head is this delicate flap that goes up and down as you turn the dial . If you do n't treat your trimmer delicately -LRB- and who does ? -RRB- and throw this thing in your shaving kit or luggage you just might find that you 've broken this small piece of plastic and thus made your trimmer completely worthless . I also found the new head to be very poor at keeping a unified level in my beard , something that really was n't a problem before.Norelco has lost my business . The next trimmer I buy will be from another company . Based on many positive reviews here on Amazon it looks like Remington has some good models .
 Had this for nearly a year and am about to throw it away and purchase a wahl , here 's why :1 . Even at full charge , the motor lacks power . This means it actually slows down , nearly to a stop , when trimming thick areas .2 . It trims unevenly , requiring multiple -LRB- and i mean more than five -RRB- passes in the same area to get the hairs somewhat the same length .3 . If you remove the length setter to get the closest shave possible , i.e. as a sideburn trimmer -LRB- like most electric razers come with -RRB- , the blades are set so far apart that they actually pinch the skin - painful and slightly bloody.Avoid this one at all costs .
 the wide trimmer doesnt allow you to trim your mustache properly and does not cut evenly under the nose which is very annoying !! Also the blade level adjuster is sensitive and when your trimming a rough beard its hard to keep the setting on the same number . dont waste your time and your money .
 This model is ok I guess but I really miss the pop out trimmer of the older model that eventually wore out after several years . Does n't seem like the choices are that good any more and I would love to find an older Norelco model l ike I had . This model trims the beard ok but the head is too wide to do any detail work and the pop out trimmer was perfect for that . Replaced a Conair unit that had a bad habit of ripping my beard hair out though -- will never buy another Conair product .
 Please , please can we have a `` no-star '' rating on Amazon , because this piece of cr-p does not merit the single star that I am obliged to award it if I wish to post this review ? Bought this item from Amazon about a year ago , and have been giving it the benefit of the doubt until now , but why bother ? Have just spent 20 minutes of my time trimming a shortish -LRB- about 1.5 '' long -RRB- beard . This is ludicrous ! My old , basic Remington clippers , which I was dumb enough to throw away when I acquired this item , would have handled the job in less than three minutes . Unlike this model , it would also have done a decent job of trimming my beard ! If this item ever reappears on Amazon , shun it like the plague ! In the meantime , suggest you approach any similar Norelco product with extreme caution .
 After just one year the rechargeable battery suddenly does n't hold a charge . The battery is not replaceable . For my next purchase I 'm staying away from Norelco .
 As others have pointed out Norelco has deliberately made it impossible to replace the rechargeable battery thus forcing you to replace the whole unit when the battery wears out , which it does rapidly . Moreover , despite Norelco/Philips being a foreign owned company the charge only works in the USA .
 This is the second beard and moustache timmer made by Norelco that I purchased but this one only lasted 6 months . I noticed immediately how much lighter this trimmer was compared to the older model I had . It must have been because of the all plastic insides since after ONLY six months the teeth that allow the trimmer to adjust broke and I had to throw it away . Guess , I should have opted for the more expensive model ... . lesson learned .
 I 've had this trimmer for like 2 years and I only used it because I was too cheap to buy a knew one , however since it stopped working completely , now I have to get a new one . It would n't stay charged that long for one.For two , it just cut horribly . I would n't suggest this product to anybody . Hope this helps .
 I have to second all the writers who found this shaver to be much less than advertised . It stopped taking a charge about 6 months after I purchased it . It is truly underpowered and overpriced . Please stay away from it .
 Fool me once , shame on you . Fool me twice , shame on me . I owned the previous model -LRB- T-760 -RRB- and after about a year it became unchargeable . Looks like it 's charging , but does n't actually charge . Figured it was a fluke and bought another one a year ago and wallah ! Same problem . However , this time , it does n't look like it 's charging . The light never comes on . I guess for 17 bucks , that 's what we should expect .
 This is my very first trimmer , so I did n't have anything to compare it to . But I did notice right away that -LRB- a -RRB- it does n't hold a charge very long and -LRB- b -RRB- takes a while to do the job , with a lot of passes . The short charge life means one more charger I have to take on vacation . It needs so many passes to do the job it takes longer than it used to take to shave , and the battery starts to wind down before I 'm done . My now-retired Panasonic shaver would go a week and a half of daily use on a single charge , and I 'll be looking for something that good after I get a few months out of this thing . I wo n't buy another Norelco .
 I 've owned this for over a year now , but I 've only had a beard intermittently during that time . I 'd say about 5 months worth of trimming.Well , like another user said , this thing was definitely under-powered from the start . And now , it has completely stopped working . It wo n't hold a charge at all . Even when it is plugged in , it 's not receiving enough power to barely turn the motor . Even if I try to charge it for a full day , the battery wo n't get charged , the unit simply gets hot to the touch . Clearly some sort of defect with the power supply/battery .
 Second Norelco I purchased . The first one worked well , but died.Thinking they were the same product , I went w / the T765 b/c I did n't need the `` side trimmer . '' Waste of money . Go w / the more powerful , yet expensive model .
 This design is just horrible . I bought this to trim my goatee which I keep pretty short . This was no problem with the unit I had before , but it 's near impossible to get a decent trim with this thing . If you look at the picture , you do n't trim with the front edge like you do with other bear trimmers , but instead have to use the spring loaded flat top part . The results from my second shave with this thing was a way short trim over my top lip and a much longer hair under my nose . Also , while trimming along my chin I seem to have tilted the thing just right to get a very short trim on one spot which looked real bad . I tried to go back and trim the rest to match , but I just could n't seem to get the trimmer at just the right angle to get an even trim . Since I already had the thing set to 1 my only other option would have been to remove the guard and free-hand the trim . Needless to say , I spent the next couple days with a very uneven goatee.The next problem I have with this thing is that you ca n't just plug it in and use it . It has to charge before you can use it , so if a charge runs out before you are done trimming , you have to wait until it charges to finish . This is completely opposite to the way their electric razors work , where if the charge runs low while shaving , you just plug it in and continue.Overall , you might want to use this if you have a full beard , or a thick goatee , but if you want to keep it trimmed short , this is not the product for you . I 'm going to go buy something else .
 If people with really good trimmers saw how I operated with this trimmer they 'd probably laugh . You have to go over and over and over the same spot to cut your beard with any semblance of uniformity . Also you have to be careful to apply equal pressure each time or your cut could be spotty because of the spring loaded guide . Also as others have said if you want a close trim , you will probably end up looking like a bad joke with plenty of skin showing.The design is bad , and the battery croaked after a few years of use -LRB- while religiously following the use/recharge guide -RRB- . Kind of annoying but probably for the best , since I can get a better unit now.When you look at the selection of 115-220 volt travel trimmers its no wonder that Norelco is producing garbage theres almost no competition . If any companies are reading this you have a wide opening to take on Norelco .
 I saw some reviews here telling that the green-to-black ones are good . So I trusted it . They really are crap too . Sony Walkman WM-101 runs longer on carbon batteries than on those . My Olympus D-580 runs out of power within 20 shots , while a pair of TDK KR15 1000MAh rechargeables give power to about 60 shots.A full charge leaks in under a week . This is a real shame for Duracell . I used to trust that brand.Don ' t buy this item ! . .
 Purchased eight 2650 mah Duracells and none of them hold a charge for more than a few days.I use a high-quality recharger and even using the discharge cycle has not improved the functionality of these batteries.I own five year-old Powerex batteries that work far better , even though they have been through hundreds of charge-deplete cycles.These Duracells are appropriate for no device as they simply do not work.Purchasers should be offered refunds by Duracell .
 These batteries are not very good at all . Even when used with a good charger , they simply do n't have a very long life . I use them in a Canon digital camera , and after one or two shots , they start taking longer and longer to recharge the flash . Now , I take them right off the charger , the camera flashes the `` low battery '' sign , and they take 10-15 seconds just to charge the flash . The batteries that came with the charger -LRB- a La Crosse -RRB- last longer per charge and have n't worn out like these have . I 'll never buy Duracell rechargeables again .
 I bought an 8pack in January 2009 for use in aCanon PowerShot Pro Series S5 IS 8.0 MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoomdigital camera . The camera uses 4 AAs and would inhale the cheapie Costco branded alkalines . However , I could only depend on one set of 4 AAs , while the other set would last about the time it took to recharge the first set . Then , after a year , these AA batteries exhibit the similar problems . They charge up nicely , but within about 10 photos , the camera starts flashing low battery . The poorly performing set just teases me by to powering up my camera so it can turn off . I 've been using theMaha Powerex MH-C9000 WizardOne Charger-Analyzerall this time and have run it through the break-in cycle , but they 're dead.I 'm running now with the little IMEDION AA 2100mAh NiMH Rechargeable Batteries w/Holder - 4 Batteries Per Pack that I purchased at the same time , but never used . Low discharge indeed to have that much power after a year.As opposed to aklaline batteries , I 've saved some landfill space by using these Duracells , but spent about the same amount of money without the confidence that a new set of cheapie AA can give you . Two stars .
 Pure junk . Could not be charged at all . It 's as if they were empty . I tried three different chargers to be certain , and not one of these eight batteries charged up.That is a horrible amount of money to loose for some of us . Duracell has no excuse to miss this kind of garbage .
 I have tried every way I can think of to get these batteries to hold a charge . After charging , they have 1.4 volts . If they sit for a week , they are down to .9 volts . The only way they work is if you use them the same day they are charged . I would not take another set of these batteries if they were given to me !
 I have two sets of 2650 and one set of 2400 . I got the first set because I wanted the 15-min charger ; very convenient for charging up the batteries as you get ready to head out with the camera . After only one year of very minimum usage -LRB- 10-12 cycles , I estimate -RRB- , most of them do n't hold their charge for more than a day or 20-25 mins of use in my digital cameras . What a waste of $ 100 .
 The Duracell NiMH 2650mAH rechargeable batteries are anything but . After a few charges they failed to hold a charge , even after they had been in one or more of my chargers for several hours . Big disappointment when you are on an 8-hour hike in the mountains and then discover ALL six pairs fail immediately when loaded in your camera . -LRB- Fortunately , I carried a non-rechargeable pair so the photo experience was not a total bust -RRB- . If I could rate them in the minus range , I would .
 I have purchased multiple sets of these batteries - they 're Duracell - what could go wrong - right ? WRONG . I have tried recharging these batteries in multiple chargers and they wont hold a charge for a quarter of the time any other brand of batteries I have do - including batteries I have had for over 5 years and have been recharged hundreds of times . I would not recommend .
 These batteries are junk . They work great for a few months and then wo n't hold a charge for more than a few days . I 'm sticking with the Sanyo Eneloops . No problems with them so far .
 I have 16 of these batteries ... . thought at first my chargers were bad . So I bought new ones thinking maybe the high capacity was too much for my other charges . Batteries say charged but do n't power up my camera . test w / alkalines camara works.So I go and buy the maha charger , do a full capactiy charge/discharge/recharge to ensure batteries are good . Maha charger fully charges , says ready to go . Plug the batteries in dead , camera beeps and off.So I then do a slow charge , float charge ... . same deal.batteries are beep-off in the camera . Take some of my older 2100mah batteries they work like a champ.Worst money I ever spent , imagine you are ready to take pictures and have these `` new great '' batteries ... you are screwed.Now to figure out how to get them replaced and make duracell live up to their warranty.Just heed the advice of others , do n't waste a minute or penny ! These were a waste of resources and shame on duracell for not recalling them.I just called their `` help desk '' they informed me that they will replace the batteries with a coupon in 2-3 weeks . I explained the quantity , they would just say I would get a coupon to replace `` most '' of the batteries . Reinforcing why you should stay clear . My lower capacity 2400 's work fine but the 2650 's are a waste of our resources and duracell needs to get these off the market . 16 bad batteries does not happen by chance.The other trivial thing , I own a professional battery charger by maha and it 's one of the best rated out there ... they believe I should use their cheap 20 dollar charger only since my charger might not work . I 'm sure they are just reading off a flowchart . They even asked me what device types I 've used them in , what types of other things did I try them in . We 'll see what `` most of my replacement coupon will be '' . My hunch is it 's going to be less than what I have bought . Did I say RUN AWAY FROM THIS CRAP BATTERY ??? Amazon needs to take this product off the site since it 's not doing their reputation any good .
 I bought these batteries think that being made by Duracell that they would be a good quality battery . How WRONG I was . These things can not hold a charge for more then a few days , and that is when they are n't even being used . I did a complete discharge and refresh on them hoping that this would help their charge hold time ... it did not.Do not buy these things if you want to have a good functioning and usable battery . I gave them 1 star because Amazon forced me too , I would have preferred 0 stars .
 I own 5 brands of NiMh batteries and these were big disappointments . Two seperate sets of 4 AA batteries held very short charges , wore out very quickly , and at least 2 are dead after only a few uses . Duracell alkaline may be amongst the best , but do not buy these . So far my Sanyo have been the highest performers . I use them in everything from cameras , flashes , flashlights , radios ... they just are poor in all applications . Others include Eveready , Rayovac , RadioShack , Sanyo . Sanyo eneloop rocks !
 I bought these batteries about 2 years ago along with the `` Duracell Rechargeable ACCU 15 Minute Charger '' that the batteries came with . They claim to last hundreds of charges before being depleted . Within 6 months , one by one each battery either A -RRB- would die in a few hours -LRB- I 'm using them for my Xbox 360 controllers -RRB- or B -RRB- Wo n't recharge at all anymore on the docking station . Now I 'm down to my final 2 that will even recharge and I basically have to recharge them once every 3-4 days . And I do n't even play my video games that much ! I 'd say about 5-6 hours a week.I 'm shocked Duracell , such a long lasting , reliable company , would make such a shoddy product .
 I had two sets of these that I used regularly for 4-5 years or so on long family vacations -- took them camping , in the mountains , to the coasts , everywhere . They were fantastic . I always kept one set charged in the camera , and a spare -LRB- charged -RRB- set in the camera bag , so I was never caught without batteries.Until I lost one this summer and purchased a couple new sets.I get about 20 photos from the set in my camera , and the set in the bag loses its power within a week . They are worthless -- and I 'm thinking about mailing them to a Duracell corporate office demanding my money back . Indeed , until I get a refund , I 'll never touch a Duracell again . Unfortunately , I do n't have my receipt or packaging , so returning them to the store I bought them from is no longer an option.I half wonder whether they accidentally made a massive bad batch . If so , they should create a recall program for people .
 I bought these batteries a while ago , but since I 've bought some replacements , i realize just how crappy these duracell batteries are . Like another reviewer stated , they do n't hold a charge . he said more that 2 weeks , when mine were freshly delivered , they did n't last more than 3 days in a wireless mighty mouse . A mouse . These Sony cycleEnergy ones and the other Sony 's prior to it have been awesome . They work fine in rockband wireless devices , and I 've been trying to drain them so I can to a recharge , but it 's taking a while . It lost 8 % charge in 2 weeks in my might mouse . I think I 'll probably go back to them . I was wooed by the great looking ratings on the duracells , but if they do n't keep the charge , the number do n't matter . ps , these were made in japan , with a blue top visible .
 I purchased this item together with a La Crosse chargerLa Crosse Technology BC-9009 AlphaPower Battery Chargerfrom MTA Trading.Shipment was fast , service was great but this product is not as great as expected.I am using these batteries on toys for my kid . Nothing that needs a high capacity though -LRB- not for digital camera -RRB- . The batteries do n't hold a charge , I never managed to reach the maximum capacity.The batteries that came with the charger are of far better quality even if not from a brand.So , do n't buy these DURACELLs . I bought them feeling secure about Duracell quality but I was wrong.They are of any use now . I 'll just dispose them.I hope this can help you to avoid making the same mistake as I did .
 I will never buy duracell NiMH again . I bought a 4-pack awhile back and only 2 of them seems to even hold a charge . I thought maybe I had a few bad batteries so I decided to buy another 8-pack duracell NiMH , and again these batteries do not seem to hold a good charge . I even have one battery reading bad when I charge it with my Ansmann Energy 16 , and the other 7 was low on charge . I decided to only go with Sanyo Eneloop now , Eneloop version 2 is coming out in Japan on Nov. 19 , 2009 .
 I 've bought either of these -LRB- green and black label -RRB- , none of them seem to hold their charge well . Voltage will drop below 1.3 V after just a week or so . Waste of money . The older Energizer 2500 mah batteries I got hold their charge much better .
 About a year ago I purchased 16 of those with a duracell brand charger and they worked pretty well for remote controls and kids ' toys that mainly makes sounds -LRB- i.e. not a huge power drain -RRB- . The duracells do self-drain a little faster that I expected but I did n't find it a huge hassle.In June 2009 I decide I need another batch so I bought another 16 . The new ones are horrible ! I charged them 2 weeks before use and I was surprised to find none of them had enough to even power a PS3 remote control . I have a travel size shaver that takes 2 AA 's which I use 2 days a week and those new duracells could n't even last 2 consecutive weeks.I wish someone can tell me I 'm doing something wrong to the batteries but chances are they just suck . Numerous cycles of recharge followed by immediate self-drain make me give up on them , now it 's more than a hassle to bother using them .
 Do n't waste your money on these , I bought 2-pks of these in Feb , 2009 based on some favorable reviews posted here . Once I received them and charged them up with myLa Crosse Technology BC-9009 AlphaPower Battery ChargerI noticed that about half of them lose their charge after sitting unused for a week or two.Go buy some SANYO eneloops instead .
 I have about 12 of these . lem me tell you something first off . If you plan to use batteries very frequently , they will do . but i left for a week on vacation and i come back only to find ALL my batteries are dead . Now i have to wait 16 + hours just to do a few things that i should 've been able to do immediately . i recommend to have a few backup packs of alkaline handy before buying these .
 I bought these as an addition to many other rechargeable AA batteries . I have had bad luck with them so I just tested them in my lacross bc-900 charger and they came up with 650-850 mahr capacity -LRB- 2650 mahr rated -RRB- . fully 1/3 or the rating . I have many older AA 's that work great and hold up for years . I never fast charge and occationally run the conditioner function on them.for some reason , these are not holding up.I just bought a bunch of eneloops . we will see how they hold up .
 I have been buying rechargeable AA batteries since the days of NiCd cells . I have purchased many brands , including Energizer , Maha Powerex , Kodak , Sanyo Eneloops , and Duracell . All degrade slowly over time -- except some Duracells , which are prone to sudden and irreversible failure . I charge with Maha chargers , including the MH-C9000 which can also recondition and analyze . Several years ago , I bought ~ 20 of these Duracells . Fully half of them no longer hold a charge.I have many Energizer , Powerex , and Kodak cells that hold nearly their rated capacity for far longer than two years . To have 50 % of the Duracells fail in this timeframe has convinced me to never buy a Duracell NiMH battery again . Ever .
 A total waste of money . I bought 8 Duracell rechargeable batteries from this vendor -LRB- NY Electronics -RRB- . The batteries do not hold the charge . If the camera has not been used for a week or so and I pick it to shoot something interesting , it is so disappointing and frustrating to find out that the batteries are absolutely dead . I am reporting this to the Duracell Company .
 I bought these batteries as replacements for a set of NiMH batteries I had bought a few years ago at Radio Shack which had finally reached end of life . Imagine my surprise when I discovered that the batteries I had just retired held a charge longer than these ! I can not understand why any company would manufacture a product as worthless as this . I first thought that my digital camera had developed a defect which caused the batteries to drain within only 3-5 days . However , the same effect occurs in other devices or even if I just store them . I was impressed by the claimed capacity of 2650 mAh but what good is that capacity if you have to use it all within a few days ? Do n't waste your money on these !
 The first batch of these Duracells that I bought were pretty good . Then I bought a bunch more on eBay and they were absolutely crap . I ca n't even take ONE picture with my little Canon camera . I press the power button and there 's not enough power left to retract the lens back into the camera ! And all of this done with batteries fully recharged right out from the Duracell 15-minutes charger.I fell cheated . robbed . No more Duracell for me , period .
 I 'm a big believer in rechargeable batteries and have purchased many brands . I 've never had such bad luck as with Duracel NiMHs . After 2 of the first 4 batteries that I tried would n't hold a charge at all , I contacted Duracell , who sent me a replacement pack . I had better luck with the replacements , but I can still count on these to last half the time of any of my other NiMHs . I 've tried refreshing these batteries with my La Crosse BC-900 , but that did n't improve the discharge rate.After trying a couple packages of Sanyo Eneloops , I 'm hooked - that 's all I 'll be buying in the future !
 They dont hold charge and their full charge is only 650 mah not 2650 mah
 Bought eight of these , they are all crap . They are the black and green , made in Japan . I use one of them in a wall clock , and the clock dies after a week . My husband uses six of them in a label maker , and every time he goes to use the label maker , it 's dead . These were all junk to begin with , and have NEVER held a charge . Going to call Duracell and ask for a coupon for some replacements . I will be using that coupon to buy 2400mAH batteries , not the 2650 's . We have 2400 's and they work fine , even after a couple of years .
 Another bad review ... please listen to us and AVOID these batteries . They worked fine for the first few charges , but now they wo n't run a basic AM radio for more than an hour before dying . Do not purchase !
 After my Energizer and Sanyo rechargeable AAs were confiscated at the airport in Paris , I was forced to replace them . Both the Energizer and the Sanyo 2700s worked beautifully , held a charge for months and powered my camera flash reliably . Unfortunately , I can not say the same for these Duracells . This is a good example of how name brand may not always be the best . These batteries discharge very rapidly -LRB- within days if unused -RRB- . I constantly have to recharge them and 2 sets are not enough for my needs - I previously never needed to take my charger with me on vacations of up to two weeks , but if I were to rely on 2 sets of these batteries , I would need to bring the charger for a weekend jaunt with scant flash photography . Do n't spend your hard earned money on these batteries !
 The Duracell 2650mAh batteries surprised me by being dead when I needed them -LRB- I thought they were ready and good for use -RRB- . It 's been only a couple of weeks roughly since I recharged the 2650mAh 's prior to my attempt to use the batteries . The astonishingly fast self-discharge rate make the 2650mAh 's impractical/inconvenient . I am discarding -LRB- properly -RRB- all eight of my Duracell 2650mAh batteries , and ordering more pre-charged batteries such as the Eneloop .
 I bought the one on the picture -LRB- black and green -RRB- and after just a little over 3 months they do n't hold the charge for half a day Horrible ! i 've even have a good charger it 's the La Crosse Technology BC-700 . But the Tenergy pre-charge bought at the same time still working fine , this is really bad , now i 'm going to try theSanyo Eneloop or the Powerex AA 2700mA . Hope this helps
 All of my Duracell 2650mah batteries have gone bad.I have other Duracell batteries I bought before I got the 2650 's and they are still going strong . I use a high quality charger so it 's a problem with the batteries for sure.If you buy these batteries , make sure you have a long warranty and a good return policy!The only batteries I buy now are eneloop AA and AAA since they their charge for a much longer time than any other battery I have found . I have to charge my Duracells the night before I use them , the eneloops I can charge the month before and the eneloops are still fully charged ! The duracells lose their charge quickly .
 This product has tarnished the Duracell 's reputation for sure . Bought a pack and they do n't hold any charge . Now I got to throw them out which creates more pollution which defeat the purpose of buying these batteries in the first place .
 5/28/10While sitting at my desk I heard a hissing sound and found the Duracell leaking a gas . I wrapped it up in a sock and threw it outside . The battery was very hot.I 've had the Duracells for under a year and These batteries never really held a charge for long but was good enough for the convenience . I emailed Duracell today to see what they want to do about the faulty battery . I have 12 AA and 4AAA .6 / 4/10 Duracell has yet to contact me . The problem has been reported to them so if someone gets injured by their batteries they have failed to follow up on a potential problem .
 Purchased 3 packs of these . Mine are labeled made in Japan . Read somewhere some are marked make in China?These are the worst batteries I have ever purchased . I tried 2 different charges . Just purchased a La Crosse Technology BC-700 from here thinking that would help . It ca n't charge them past 1,000 mAH . It is not the charger.Update . . wanted to post that I told the charger to discharge the cells first , than charge . When that failed , I told it to condition it , i.e. discharge , charge , until some change , 3 days of this . This did n't work . Will not hold a charge , will not take the full charge .
 Believe the positive reviews of these batteries , they are the best you can buy , and that even means the other brands rated 2700mAh -LRB- or more -RRB- . I have more than 60 of these , I use them in torches , remote controls , wireless mice / keyboards , anything that will take them.If you have a charger like mine -LRB- Maha WizardOne MH-C9000 -RRB- that will take a capacity reading , do a comparison for yourself against Energizers , generic , chinese cells , anything . And you will find like I did that the Duracells have higher capacity and lower leakage than any high capacity AA cell.After a slow charge , you will find , Duracells
 I had bought two sets of these as the `` 4-pack '' . Sadly , half of my batteries do n't hold a charge . Since I have the La Crosse Technology BC-900 AlphaPower Battery Charger , I can check the current voltage of the batteries . After brief usage , some batteries still had high voltage , while others had completely run out !! Consequently , I do n't use the ones that do n't hold a charge -LRB- and the others work just fine -RRB- . I own many other brands of batteries , but these are the worst . I think the Rayovac have been the best .
 I am so totally disappointed by these batteries that I could simply spit bullets . I bought them for my digital camera about four months ago . I am * not * a big photo enthusiast so only grab the camera for `` special '' events like the kids recital at school , birthdays , and so on . Imagine my dismay to find that all eight of these batteries totally lose their charge after sitting for a day or two after a recharge . I 've even tried a different recharger ... same results . The no-name batteries that came with my camera work like a charm ... these name brand tripe are heading for the recycle bin !
 I purchased an eight pack of batteries for two Canon flashes . This product is always the first to lose the power . I have other rechargeable brands that last days longer . I do n't know if I got a bad batch of these batteries or not . As it is I would never purchase this brand of rechargeable batteries again .
 These batteries looked like exact replacements for my digital camera . The original batteries worked great !!! These will not hold a charge evensitting on the shelf . I charged all 8 batteries before a family event , and took several pictures . A week later , we had more family over and took a few pictures . Then , the next day , the batteries were dead . I replaced them with another set -LRB- recently charged -RRB- , and was able to take TWO pictures before they were dead . I put in a third set -LRB- recently charged -RRB- , and they were dead immediately : - -LRB-
 These are absolute garbage for photography . I read the user reviews about the long shelf like and liked the high capacity rating , but my experience has been the opposite in the 3 months or so I 've had them . It seems like they ca n't hold a charge for even a week , after an overnight charge . I bought them for use in a Canon 430EX II Speedlite and often times find that my flash is useless because the batteries are dead . I 'll try the Sanyo Eneloops of Panasonics next time .
 Bought 8 of these Duracell 2650 mAh rechargeables right before my 2-week archaeological expedition to a remote desert in Peru , because they were supposed to last so long in my digital camera . Wow , did it * suck * that not a one of them held their charge ! These batteries are worse than useless - they almost caused me to miss my photo-ops for this whole trip!Good thing I 'd also brought along a pack of Energizer Lithium batteries , because they seriously kicked * ss , and even lasted much longer than I 'd expected -LRB- way over 600 pictures per set -RRB- ! Never trusting Duracells again ! -LRB- wish I could give zero - or negative-stars in the rating ! -RRB-
 I 'm a semi-pro photographer with experience in the field and when it comes to trust , these batteries do n't have mine.I 've always liked regular Duracell batteries better than any other but after a few months of regular use , my 2650mAh with 15min quick charger have n't held up . After a full charge , I can expect to get a solid run out of them -LRB- 250 photos , 1/4 of them with flash -RRB- from my Canon A710IS , but leave those batteries sitting in the camera for a few days ??? I fully expect them to be dead . I agree with the other 1 star reviewers . Too bad . I wo n't give up on Duracell though . I 'll just be patient , though I have heard good things about Sanyo 's Eneloop batteries .
 Writing good reviews is always a joy because you affirm to yourself that you made the correct decision . -- This wo n't be one of those -- . Before you add these batteries to your cart , think about all the other low reviews on this product , then please move on.I purchased these batteries for a variety of purposes and so far six out of the eight batteries have failed to charge on the first try or failed to hold a charge more than 4 days -LRB- probably more than 90 % depleted since I was only able to take two photos . For you techies , you are probably thinking , `` Its your charger '' . I understand your point as I 've tried two chargers , my ole reliable MAHA MH-C401FS that has successfully charged my other PowerEx , Sanyo , and and Sony HiMH batteries . On one new set of these Duracell 's I tried my Sony charger that came with the Camera and it took fully four more hours to charge the Duracell 's -LRB- My two year old Sony 2500 MaHr batteries were my measuring stick -RRB- but these Duracells were found to be depleted three days later when I dropped them into a radio -LRB- BTW
 These batteries DO NOT hold a charge . I use them for my backup point and shoot which might sit for a couple of months before use . I learned -LRB- the hard way -RRB- long ago to recharge the batteries just before I was going to use them . As I did not want to carry my DSLR into a pizza restaurant , I took my Powershot A620 instead . I had charged the batteries -LRB- all 8 -RRB- the evening before . I managed 25 pictures in 20 minutes before the 1st set -LRB- different duracell rechargeables -RRB- died . I got 5 pictures on these before the batteries died . I was quite upset as all the partygoers had not yet arrived . The next morning when I charged these batteries , nothing happened when I put them into the camera -LRB- I had a family gathering to go to that afternoon -RRB- . Completely dead . So much for recharging them up to 1000 times . I doubt that I recharged them even 20 times . Duracell has lost a customer .
 My previous experience with rechargeable batteries are theRayovac I-C3 15 Minute Rechargeable Batteries , AA , 4 batteries , and they blow the socks off these sorry things.I 'll charge up a batch of four and often I 'll find they 're dead in a matter of days just sitting in a plastic dish . I 'd recommend looking into another product , as I 'll personally avoid Duracell going forward .
 Bought these a few months back , and they are worthless . They seem to lose most of their charge in a week -LRB- or less -RRB- . In use , they die very quickly.I have a couple older AA Duracell batteries that work just fine ... so maybe Duracell changed something . The good/older batteries are colored green/white and say `` Made in Singapore '' . The bad/newer batteries are colored green/black and say `` Made in Japan '' .
 I have used alkaline Duracell batteries for years and have always been satisfied with their quality . Recently I purchased a number of these rechargeable NiMH batteries and have been sadly disappointed . They wo n't hold a charge ! The only way that I have found them usable at all is to take them from the charger and use them right away - otherwise they are dead before they get started . Sorry , Duracell , but you have really hurt yourself - and your faithful customers - with this poor product . Even though I have a number of these and they have been used almost not at all I will likely toss them out and buy some other brand that will work when I need them .
 I purchased a high-end battery charger -LRB- Lacrosse -RRB- and of the 3 different brands of batteries that I use , these are by far the worst in terms of how long they hold the charge . I fully charged two of them 3 days ago , and just put them in a Logitech mouse . Immediately got a warning that the battery level was `` critical . '' Never again !
 These are the junk HR6 DC1500 which only hold their charge for a brief time . After 10-15 days storage , they will be completely depleted . Use these the same day they are charged for full capacity .
 ... but that 's the definition of any battery . And unfortunately , these batteries leak faster than any rechargeable cells I 've ever encountered.The nominal charge on all NiMH cells is 1.2 V. Usually right after a charge , they 'll be 1.36 or so , and even after a few months should be around 1.3 . However , all these batteries leak far faster than that . After two weeks of just sitting in a box , of the eight I charged , two were down to 0.94 volts , others hovering near a volt , and the best of them barely reading 1.2 . I 'm afraid Duracell has permanently damaged their reputation with me because of this . Oddly , I bought an identical-looking set from them two years earlier , and they are still going great . There must be some defect with these -- but judging by the most recent reviews here , it is hardly an isolated incident .
 They do not last too long . I have death batteries after several -LRB- 4-5 -RRB- charges . This product is always the first to lose the power . I have other rechargeable brands that last days longer . I do n't know if I got a bad batch of these batteries or not . As it is I would never purchase this brand of rechargeable batteries again .
 PROs : - They worked for a while.CONs : - My charger declared these unusable after about 15 charges . -LRB- Duracell claims `` up to 1000 charges . '' -RRB- - The amazon listing also claims they `` last nearly 1 1/2 hours '' in a camera , which is a senseless claim . - You can get quality `` Low Self-discharge '' batteries for less cost than these self-draining batteries . - - - Alternatives - - - A much better deal would beSANYO NEW 1500 eneloop 8 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable BatteriesorAmazonBasics AA NiMH Precharged Rechargeable Batteries -LRB- 8-Pack , 2000 mAh -RRB- .
 If these are the batteries with the green labeling , I can not recommend them . Electro-chemically they seem fine , and hold a good charge for a long time , but the batteries are just a little too fat to fit most of my AA devices . I have to conclude they do not meet AA mechanical specs . So I have to use the competing brand for most of my equipment .
 I 'm on my second lot of 16 after thinking that my quick charger might have ruined the first set . So I switched to a trickle charger with a fresh set of betteries only to learn that it 's not the charger , it 's the batteries . Most of them will not hold a charge longer than a few days . Totally worthless .
 I purchased 16 of these pieces of junk -LRB- green top , no gold -RRB- about 18 months ago , and every single one ca n't hold a charge longer than about a week or ten days . They seem to work more or less OK if you just need batteries that work for a day or two , but it 's an absolute must to leave them in the charge up until the moment they 're needed . Stay away if you can . * Edit : To Duracell 's credit , when I complained in their comment section of the website , they sent me coupons for replacement rechargeables , which I used to buy some of the `` precharged '' -LRB- low self-discharge -RRB- ones . I still say to be careful about these , but Duracell stepped up and if you get stuck with a bad batch like I did , you might have similar results .
 For some reason , you took the cans out of the plastic wrap provided by the manufacturer and put them in a box where they knocked against each other and were damaged .
 Although Glucerna seems to help avoid low blood glucose , it is sweet , sweet , sweet ! And , ironically , full of things that are otherwise bad for you , like transfat and palm oil , and little that is good . Another brand of diabetic snack bar is not likely to be worse , and almost certainly would be better . The makers of this bar do n't care about our health
 When i recieved the product it was about 97 degrees . Needless to say , they were melted . They still taste good , just look bad .
 It 's nearly a month , and I 'm still waiting for this delivery . Diabetics depend on these snacks , is why they were ordered in bulk .
 Glucerna Snack Bar has very high saturated fat and many artificial preservatives . It tastes very bad as well . I do n't recommend .
 I love this product but I have a hard time with my children taking it because they do n't like the taste . I did find that if you mix it with a little bit of juice they will drink it but they still complaint about the taste . It is so much trouble that I probably will not purchase it again . : \
 I ca n't believe how many 5 star reviews this product got . I can get my son to take it -LRB- I have to coax him to do it -RRB- , but he does not care for the taste . I am currently looking for a different product that has a taste that appeals to him .
 The title clearly states that this offer is for a four count case of 1 gallon Windex bottles from this vendor . What arrived is a single gallon bottle in a box from Sam 's Club . This is out and out fraud . I am so angry I can barely type . This better be a monumental screw up or I want somebody in handcuffs . Do n't people understand that wire fraud is a felony ?
 It only charges for 20 minutes and not even half charged.You can take 10 pictures with them , it is useless ! Speaked to vidpro , they are aware of the problems . They asked me to ship them back and pay $ 9 shipping and handling for replacements . The total cost comes to $ 20 if I want get it exchanged . It 's not worth that . it is absolutely a terrible experience !
 I regret that I purchased these batteries and the charger . All I can say is that the batteries do n't hold a charge . A wasted $ 40.00
 my AAA battery last about 4 to 5 hour -LRB- i use 700mmh -RRB- but worst thing is sometimes , 30 min per charge.don ' t know whyi do not recommand this product
 In the past , we have loved Metab Herbs -LRB- capsules -RRB- . I never dreamed this would be in a form other than capsules . It is like eating grass ! We have n't been able to come up with any way of taking it that does n't cause nausea . I thought about sending back the second bottle which was unopened , but I thought we might figure out how to get it into our system . My suggestion would be that the company should never attempt to sell this in `` grass '' form . Guess we are wimps ...
 The description says these are `` all natural . '' I was amazed as the colors are very vibrant , so I checked their website . They are NOT natural and are packed with artificial , petroleum-based colors like most other colored sprinkles . If you 're looking for naturally colored sprinkles & colorings , try ChocolateCraftKits dot com .
 Do n't waste your money . Used them on my trip to Europe and they were completely ineffective . What a joke ! A true rip off .
 Please go to Sam 's club or COSTCO and get a pack of 24 for $ 32 . Product itself is highly recommended but not at the price available here .
 I get the same amount at my sams club for cheaper ! no way i am ordering from here at that price !
 great product 5 * stoo expensive 1 * My local BJs sells this 24 pack at $ 37
 I have been giving my child these products for 2 years & she loves them all . The problem is not with the product but the prices charged on this site . Everyone knows you can find these for under $ 10 a six pack in grocery stores , plus you can use coupons . I have NEVER paid more than $ 8.00 for this . I only joined amazon mom for this product & I ` m sorry I bothered .
 DO NOT BUY from any of these guys ! , try your local TARGET ! a 6 pack of 24 oz bottles costs barely $ 10 . You are better off going there to stock up ! some of the prices on here are ridiculos !!
 Terrible product ! I was reading the label to see why this would be considered a good thing to give to children and I am shocked at how much pure garbage is in it -- junk soy protein , artificial colors and flavors ... NOT something that should be marketed as healthy for children . You would be better off giving them an organic yogurt shake .
 This deodorant is truly unscented . It is not invisible as advertised . Also , right after I put on the deodorant and a dark color shirt I will see white stains from deodorant on the shirt.I mainly got it for the `` invisible '' part .
 I could n't figure out why my clothes were bleaching , then when I switched to a new anti perspirant the problem disappeared ! BAN IS BAD ! BAD STAINS . UUGhhh ... I lost hundreds of dollars in clothes because of it , and I even thought I should go to a doctor ! This ca n't be healthy .
 There 's not a lot more to say
 Ordinarily , I would n't call a sewn in tag a serious design problem , but in this case , it is just plain stupid how the tag is attached . The tag is rather irritating , so I decided to remove it . It appears as though the tag is just sewn onto the upper end of the support , and that you can just remove the stitches and be rid of it . Wrong . The stitches that hold the tag on , are the same stitches that are used to put the brace together . If you cut the stitches , you screw up the integrity of the brace . I expect mine will fall apart a lot sooner than it should now.It would have been nice to have some sort of warning to not remove the friggin tag . They can print a manual in 20 different languages , but they ca n't be bothered to warn you not to cut the stupid tag off ?? It 's a good elbow support , but do n't make the same mistake I did .
 I purchased the correct size based on the companies measurement process . The portion of the brace that fits over the forearm seems to fit well , but the portion that sits over the upper arm is SUPER baggy on the backside -LRB- tricep -RRB- portion of my arm . There is no way this thing would provide any support for me , might as well wear a sock . Unless you are really fat and have a huge amount of flesh on the back of your arm , you will not find a size that will fit and perform as described . Also , their return policy is terrible . Cost me over $ 40 in shipping and restocking fees to return this pos .
 I first came across these in a hotel room where we had stayed . I ordered a number of them , but I ca n't say I 'm that happy with them . The rooms I placed them in are just too large I guess . They are faily expensive , and they did n't last a month . I ca n't say I 'd recommend them .
 I purchased this lemon scent natural magic hoping it eliminate smell from my shoes closet . It turns out this thing smells worse than my shoes . There is some extremely strong odor that covers any smell , however i ca n't it and it makes me nausea , I highly do not recommend this if you want fresh smell at home .
 Do n't think that the sweet flavor in 1 serving comes from the 2 grams of sugar . They are dumping massive amounts of the artificial sweetener Acesulfame , also known as `` Sweet One '' , into this protein shake . Amazon should be more forthright in advertising this product .
 Blech !! I have to plug my nose to get this stuff down in the morning . I 've been using American Sports Nutrition , American Whey in Chocolate ... religiously , but when my local dealer was out of it one day , she talked me into switching to this ... telling me that it tasted great . AWFUL , absolutely awful in comparison to American Whey . I ca n't wait until she gets it back in stock , so I can ditch this stuff . What a waste of money !!
 Having tried other Whey products , I was really disappointed with this one . Way too sweet . If you need something to discourage your use of protein powder , this it it !
 Appears less effective than a competitor 's product from Larrea Biosciences , Inc. , which I have used for almost 2 years . Also , being in uncoated tablet form , instead of capsule form , Chaparrel 's strong odor contaminates the taste of other pills when stored in a weekly pill organizer . I tried Chaparral because it 's considerably cheaper than the other , but I will not reorder it .
 I would give this 0 stars but the option does not exist . Do not waste your money these tweezers are completely useless . I got a free lighted mirror and pedicure set but it was still not worth the money !!!
 First of all , I never wrote a review , but this thing sucks so bad , I had no choice . Consider this a warning.First of all , the magnifying lens is useless . If you were tweezing your brows , you would have to hold it almost vertically just to see thru the lens . I dont know about everyone else , but I hold mine at slightly more than a 90 degree angle . The people who made this must have forgotten that your eyes are under your brow not over it and a mirror would not help with this very much . And if using the lense , you would have to pull the hair straight down instead of in the direction of the hair growth like youre suppose to . So basically the lens is nothing but a piece of plastic that just gets in the way . Attempting to actually make use of it , will only make tweezing more complicated . And it really isnt.And the light is a sharp blue LED which is almost too bright . Honestly I dont see the point . Maybe if it was just a regular light -LRB- not blue -RRB- it would soften the glow a little bit , making the hair easier to see . I just turned it off.I tried to use it as a regular pair of tweezers , and the palm of my hand started to get sore . The Luma Tweeze is made slightly wider because of the lense and the light in the middle . It is actually too bulky to even use as a regular pair of tweezers.I figured this thing would be too good to be true . I love cool gadgets . Too bad this was not one of them . So instead of ordering it online and paying for shipping , then again for shipping if I had to return it , I went Beyond . I mean Bed Bath and Beyond . They had it for $ 6.99 . Not too much of an investment for something that doesnt work . But I prefer to get my money back and buy me a nice pair of plain tweezers that I can actually use.To LumaTweeze ... Thanks but no thanks .
 Product was delivered before the promised time , but about the quality of the product ... I 'm not very happy , the light is nice & bright , but it is very wide making the tweezing very stressful on the fingers !
 These tweezers are a big joke . The light is not near bright enough and the tweezers do n't pluck my eyebrows because they do n't come together . I definetly wasted my money on this one ! Do not buy this item !
 I ordered the LumaTweeze Pro this past week 12/29/09 , They Shipped me the LumaTweeze , The LumaTweeze was not worth the price at all . I am very surprised they would advertise -LRB- Image Displayed -RRB- one thing and ship another . The LumaTweeze is not worth it at all .
 Seller did not send the tweezers illustrated . Sent bigger rounded bulkier model - impossible to use . Too costly to ship back . Do n't waste your money on these . Try the La-Tweez Illuminated Tweezers instead . They work pretty good .
 Lets ' face it ; sometimes the price of an item will tell you the quality . I am used to buying $ 15 - $ 20 tweezers but I thought I would buy the Luma Tweeze Pro as I need another pair of tweezers . Well , its BAD , not worth it .1 . They are not sharp . I tried to sharpen them but because they are made of a cheaper metal , they ca n't be sharpen well .2 . LED light , the light is blocked by the tweezers when you get close to your eyebrow .3 . Magnifier glass gets on your way as you must to keep the tweezers in a specific place in order to use it .4 . `` Grabs even the finest Hairs '' yeah , whatever .5 . You have a 60 day limited warranty but you have to pay $ 5.99.6 . After 20 minutes , my fingers were killing as I tried hard to use them.Good brand tweezers can be sharpen few times before they wear out . These , I bought them today ; they are already in my garbage can .
 This came in a good container , all the way to my front door . The mailman threw it down on my porch breaking the lid causing the container to empty out . The article had no protection underneath , only on top .
 ABC offered this product , as well as all its products , with a free shipping promotion if items ordered totaled $ 100.00 or more . Naturally , due the weight of this item , the free shipping offer was a fantastic promotion . Unfortunately , shortly after ordering , I was notified that ABC was `` out of stock '' and , therefore , my order was cancelled . Now ... perhaps I am being inordinately suspicious but I suspect the order was cancelled due to ABC 's unwillingness to honor promotion . IMO , it either should not offer products for sale that are `` out of stock '' or merely suspend the transaction until products are , again , in stock . Bad business practice .
 WHAT YOU SEE IN THE PICTURE IS ` NOT ' WHAT YOU WILL BE RECEIVING ! WHAT IS SHOWN IN THE PICTURE IS A COMPLETE WELCH ALLYN FIBER OPTIC SIGMOIDOSCOPE / ANOSCOPE SET THAT TYPICALLY SELLS FOR OVER WELL OVER $ 2,000.00 . WHAT IS ADVERTISED IS JUST THE ` LIGHT HANDLE ' -LRB- MODEL # 73210 -RRB- FOR THIS KIT , NOTHING ELSE .
 They ran extremely small . Even though I had measured my hand , still got wrong size . They run way to small and tight .
 I tried the small first - based on the measuring guide , it should have fit . Could not get it on . My wrist measures 6.5 &#34; - based on the guide the medium should have been an easy fit . It 's so tight it causes more pain . I 've given up on this brand .
 This was purchased to help with my daughters wrist support during volleyball . The wrist brace fell apart within one week .
 It looks like they bought a elastic bandage wrap and cut off a 6-inch piece and just sewed the ends together.took approximately 2 days before it started to crumple up around my wrist like a stretched out sock.took approximately a week before the seam started to unravelyes , there is a big seam running lengthwise down the wrist support where they have sewed it together . There is NO support from this item because it 's so poorly made and not stiff enough.you would be far better off wrapping an Ace bandage around your wrist several times before using this.not worth buying AT ANY PRICE ... it just falls apart .
 The item was not like the description on the website . I tried contacting them twice to find out how to return the item . They never replied to my emails . This is the worst transaction I have ever had on Amazon !
 I have tendonitis in both hands . While this product is better than nothing , it really does n't do much . Honestly it caused my wrists to be more uncomfortable after a day at the computer than wearing nothing at all . It 's better to go with something that has more support .
 This product gave me Awful stomach cramps . Seller has a no return policy . Read the entire ad before buying . Did not work for me . Not what I thought .
 My $ 100 + Norelco razor died after nearly 7 years so I decided to give this mid-range panasonic razor a try since it uses different blades . The thing vibrates like crazy and it gave me razor burn . The separate adapter only works on 120V which means you ca n't use it in Europe or Asia - Norelco 's voltage converter was integrated and could be used seamlessly with 120V and 220V and the cord was coiled for easy storage . Its also made in China , which usually means `` low-end '' today . In short this razor falls short of my expectations and I hope to be able to return it and get my $ 50 + money back .
 The Panasonic ES7024SC was a terrible shaver . It missed spots and was very insufficient . I must give credit where credit is due though ; Amazon did promptly refunded my money back , so I am greatful for that . I was n't sure how the refund process was going to be , but I was very satisfied with Amazon 's service .
 Just five months and it is gone . Simply stopped running . Water seems to have reached the internal parts .
 Does an effective use but I regret the purchase because : - the charger weighs more than the normal rechargeable shaver and thus difficult to carry on trips , and - it does not have a universal charger/adaper that can work on 110-220 volts as rechargeable shavers normally do . So it is useless if you travel to Europe as I do.From now on , I will stick to Braun , Philips etc. .
 I am a long time panasonic shaver user -LRB- 8 years + -RRB- , but this shaver is one of the worse ever . I was so disappointed with this one . I hope I will be able to return it and get my money back ... trust me ... this shaver is not for anyone ... should not have been on the market at all .
 Really disappointed in the quality of the brace ... it does help my ankle some , but the area around the seams started puckering almost immediately , making it difficult to keep it smooth under clothing/socks ...
 This product was independently tested by Consumer Labs and was found to have only 41 % of the Vitamin A it claims to have . Very disappointing .
 These tablets are very large , very difficult to swallow . I have to chew these vitamins and it 's not the best taste .
 There are many different types of prenatal vitamins , and so if this is your first pregnancy you will probably be just as lost as I was on which is the best for me . I came to amazon and just picked the most bought prenatal vitamin and figured it must be good.The pills are VERY big , and they cause * for me * a lot of heartburn . They make me pretty sick everytime I take them . So I pretty much have stopped taking them . You have the taste in your mouth for a while after taking them.Overall there are many other pills out there that you can buy that are much smaller . . if anything else . Stuart prenatal vitamins are pretty popular , and pretty easy to take.As far as rainbow lite , its as if its a punishment everytime i have to take it.So in concluding , id say rainbow lite works , but they are just uncomfortable . . And if you could find another brand that works for you , I would try that first .
 I do not like this brand . I do n't think my body absorb whatever nutrients supposed to contain in the vitamin pills .
 This is day 3 with these and the 2nd day in a row I 've gagged and thrown up in the sink . I had been using another kind , but the iron was too low so I switched . It 's been AWFUL ! Like another reviewer said , its the taste/smell/size combo . It 's not working for me AT ALL . and I can take large pills just fine normally , and my other prenatals were n't particularly small either . But they did n't smell or make me gag . Tonight I cut them in half to see if that would help . The first half went down fine . The second I gagged again and threw up in the sink . I give up !
 i bought this but i got a headache on this vitamins and stomach pain it 's a waste of money ...
 They were the cheapest on the shelf a the time and I cant even bare the smell of them or taste of them . I dont chew them but if you take them with water they taste HORRIBLE .
 These pills are HUGE and incredibly dry !!! Are you kidding me ? I 'm supposed to swallow these while I 'm nauseous ?!? Fat chance ! Although I have to admit , when I cut the pill into 3 pieces and choked each piece down with a ton of OJ , I did n't experience any weird side effects . So if you do n't have a problem swallowing really big , chalky pills , the vitamins and minerals in these pills seem to balance nicely with your digestive system .
 The ingredients seem good , which is why I bought them but they should have split the pill into two and coated it with something because it is nauseating to swallow . If you have a sensitive gag reflex , find something else . Otherwise , you should be fine but I 'm trying something else .
 I did n't like how big this pill was or how 1/2 of the time i took it i would burp and `` taste ' the pill and hour or two after i took it .
 Full disclosure
 Although the product seems to be well made and all the ingredients are plant-based , it made me feel horrible . I have taken myself off these prenatals and started taking a cheaper brand that dissolves easy and my morning sickness has disappeared . They smell terrible , causing myself to gag at just the smell . I 've been taking them at bedtime trying to not get sick on them , does n't always work that way .
 These vitamins gave me horrible constipation . I like the fact that you have to take only one , but I ca n't get past the stomach pains . I 'm going to try something else.Rainbow Light Just Once Prenatal One Multivitamin , 150 tablets
 I love Rainbow Light vitamins and supplements ; I have never had any complaints with the quality or the company . However , if you look at this seller 's pictures , you may believe -LRB- as I did -RRB- that the Prenatal Petites require you to take one tablet per day . When I got my shipment , I realized that the photo was not of a Prenatal Petites bottle , as you are actually required to take three tablets daily . Had I known , I would have found the other Rainbow Light prenatal that only requires one tablet daily .
 I can not comment on the health benefits of this product - I have to trust the manufacturer that this is as good as it says it is . What I can comment on is that these pills are HUGE and difficult to swallow . The outside of these pills are a bit rough and are harder than all others that I 've tried to swallow . I 'm going through the bottle while alternating with other pre-natal pills but on the days that I have to take these I dread swallowing them . I normally do not have a problem swallowing any pills so believe me when I say that these are tough to swallow .
 I have mixed opinions about this product . Although I felt really well in the first weeks , in the 6th and 7th weeks of my pregnancy I felt super bad after taking these vitamins . During those weeks when I was more susceptible to nausea and vomiting , I felt even worse after taking these vitamins . The smell , the taste of pills made me feel really sick in my stomach . Actually when I was vomiting I tasted the bad flavor of this product in my mouth . Today I would not recommend these vitamins . Furthermore , be careful if you are taking these vitamins associated with Rainbow 1 DHA . Please watch your vitamins intake because the excess of some vitamins may be dangerous for you and your baby .
 Although these appear to have wonderful ingredients and are just once a day , I dread taking them because I throw them back up every time , even since I cut them in half . They are so huge , so dry and so wide that it makes me cry to take them . So , for what is worth , go with the organic in the veggie capsules . They are worth taking four per day !
 I received the bottle thinking it would be prenatal vitamins since that 's what everything says this is . My package came and it says Women 's One . Has anyone else had this issue ?
 I gave this vitamin a try and had to stop taking it due to symptoms of constipation . I tried it every other day and it still was not helpful . I would not recommend this prenatal vitamin solely for the major discomfort it caused .
 My insurance does not cover prenatal vitamins , so on the hunt for something I could afford I purchased these . I liked that they were natural , included ginger extract , and were one a day.But surely they can make a vitamin that tastes better than this ? I 've tried a range of other vitamins , and never have I had anything that tastes this bad . I do n't understand the folks who said this does n't taste bad - did they get different pills ? Are their taste buds dead ? Even the smell in opening the bottle is overwhelming . My current method is trying to cover the pungent taste -LRB- and aftertaste -RRB- with milk . Does n't quite work , but anything to take the edge off.I do take them with the Mommy 's Bliss Omega-3 DHA supplements , and those are quite nice .
 I did not realize until after I ordered them and had just started using them that this formula contains raspberry leaf . I am not a medical professional but from what I 've read and been advised , raspberry leaf must be avoided during most of your pregnancy because it can cause uterine contractions or some other uterine problems . In the very end of the pregnancy around your due date it 's ok because it helps tone the uterus . But before that , you do n't want raspberry leaf 's effects on your uterus until you are getting ready to deliver . By the way , same issue applies to Mom To Be Tea by a different company that makes herbal teas -LRB- edit
 These pills made me so nuseas I couldn ' even eat . I thought it was my pregnancy symptoms but as soon as I stopped taking the pills I noticed a 90 % difference , I was able to eat and woke up feeling better . I am usuallly good with vitamins since I have taken them even prior to being PG but I guess the iron may be too harsh on my tummy .
 I rarely complain about things on Amazon and , in general , am an easy pill taker - no problems swallowing pills -LRB- even large ones -RRB- and no problem with pill odors . I bought these as soon as I found out I was pregnant based on the good reviews . My first trimester consisted of a lot of nausea and from the first day I opened the bottle of these pills , I almost lost it . The smell was intolerable !! I could barely take them throughout the 1st trimester and instead , wound up taking all of the gel tab pills that came to me through free samples from my OB 's office . Once 1st trimester was over -LRB- and my free supply had run out -RRB- , I decided to try them again . It was a little better but the smell still persists each and every time I open the bottle . Even my husband ca n't stand the smell if he happens to be standing nearby . Because of how bad they are , I still gag about every other day and in general , the whole thing has been a VERY unpleasant experience for me . I should probably have just returned them right from the start , but I did n't and now I 'm stuck . And also in my 8th month , so this ordeal is almost over . I will definitely be buying gel tabs if I ever get pregnant again !
 Its been about a month or more and I still have n't received the Rainbow Light Prenatal Just Multivitamin . I was excited to try them
 I took these vitamines just 3 times , but I started getting hives on my face and all over my body . I stopped taking vitamins but unfortunitaly the hives did not go away . It has been 5 days that I have not taken them but I still have hives on my face and body . They are itching very much . May be it is very rarely side effect , I do n't know . But I know that right now I 'm suffer from hives.Besides , in the nights of the days that I took the vitamins , I could not sleep well and when I slept I had nightmares . After I stopped taking them , nightmares ended .
 After having my baby I wanted to continue prenatal supplements because I felt so healthy on them ! These got great reviews so I decided to try them , but IMMEDIATELY gave me horrible skin !! I 'm 30 , have combination skin , and occasionally get little break outs but nothing major . After three days of vitamins my skin is completely broken out despite continuing my normal skin routine with Murad salicylic wash . What a nightmare !
 I had this prenatal early this year for my first pregnancy . I had a miscarriage at 7 weeks ... I do n't know if its directly related to this vitamin , but every body type is different . I did some research on the vitamins ... That 's a lot of b12 and vitamin a. Seems like some of the other ingredients are excess as well . Be careful before purcHasing this product . Make sure you get a prenatal vitamins according to your lifestyle and diet . Other than this , it did have a positive affect on my hair ... It actually stopped falling .
 I have never gotten morning sickness . But this stuff made me gag the first time I opened the bottle . I took it every day for about 9 weeks , but one day I took it and about an hour later , I felt sick to my stomach . I vomited the stuff up and felt so much better . These pills are large , a weird greenish color and smell bad . Do n't get these . Again , this is coming from a pregnant woman who does n't even get morning sickness ! Imagine what it could do to someone who does .
 My obstetrician recommended these vitamins , so I was excited to try them out . Unfortunately , the seal under the cap was broken upon arrival . In addition , the cotton layer looked like it was pushed out of the way . It was positioned such that it looked obvious that someone had placed their finger inside the bottle . The distributor , All Star Health , said that the seals sometimes get broken during the shipping process by extreme changes in temperature from hot to cold . I feel that if this is the case , the manufacturer should change their sealing technology so that the seals do n't break . The distributor offered a refund , which I am taking them up on . However , the refund does not cover the shipping that I paid to get the item , or the shipping I 'll pay to send the item back , so there 's a $ 10 shipping loss on a $ 20-something dollar purchase .
 I started taking these vitamins when I first found out I was pregnant -LRB- at 5 weeks -RRB- . I had to discontinue use when I started to get morning sick because it only exacerbated my nausea . In the throes of morning sickness , I started taking a multivitamin suggested by my OB . When I ran out of my OB recommended prenatal vitamin I was 8 months pregnant so I started to take the Rainbow Light vitamin again . Well , the nausea was gone , but I have had the worst nightmares and the most vivid dreams ever since . I ca n't directly blame the vitamin , but I do not have the vivid nightmares if I forget to take my vitamin . I have n't read about anyone else having this problem and my OB thinks that it is unrelated , but I wanted to share my story . I hope you have better luck with this vitamin than I did .
 I took these vitamins for 1 year before my first pregnancy , 9 months of pregnancy , and then two years after my pregnancy . They did not make me feel nauseous . They are large and can be difficult to take for that reason , but other than that no issues . However , the FDA confirmed in 2009 that these vitamins contain lead , which you can read more about on their website . For that reason I would never take -LRB- nor recommend -RRB- these vitamins again .
 I do n't know what it is in this vitamin , but I started getting hives that come and go all over my arms and legs a few days after starting them . Once I stopped the hives went away . The pills are large but I did not have any difficultly swallowing them . No other side effects at all other than the hives , which were bad enough that I had to completely stop taking them .
 Purchased these multivitamins for a friend via Amazon Prime -LRB- sold by Electronica Direct -RRB- last week . The supplement facts posted in an image here on Amazon are NOT what is posted on the Rainbow Light web site nor does it match what is on the bottle . THE DIFFERENCE IS SIGNIFICANT . As of this posting , the correct information can be found here
 I went for these vitamins because they had a lot of good ingredients and were relatively cheap compared to other vitamins in the market . As noted by other reviewers , the vitamin is very difficult to swallow . I thought I would overcome that problem ; however , I dreaded the moment of taking it every morning . On the worst side , it does give constant constipation -LRB- I apologize for being graphic -RRB- , as other reviewers also noticed.I still finished the whole bottle of Rainbow Prenatal so that I would not waste the money spent ; however , I went back to the more expensive Oculair 120 VegiCaps -LRB- also called Biosyntrx-oculair on Amazon -RRB- vitamin that I have been taking for several years prior to trying Rainbow Prenatal . Even though Oculair is more expensive , it 's so much easier to swallow having a soft cover of each individual tablet , and I have no side effects from it as I had with Rainbow Prenatal.I hope this helps . Best wishes !
 I 've been taking this for 2 years while my hubby and I tried to conceive . I did n't have any problems in all that time . It is a HUGE , non-coated pill , but I did n't have too much trouble swallowing it.Then I got pregnant.At about 5 weeks , it became impossible to swallow without gagging and forcing it down my throat . I almost vomited trying to swallow the darn thing . It 's just too big !! I only just learned that in 2008 , the FDA identified this vitamin as being number 5 in the list of prenatal vitamins containing the most lead ! You can read more about it by doing a search for `` prenatal vitamins lead '' and then clicking on the link to the FDA 's site.Definitely scary stuff !
 I took these vitamins for a few months during my second pregnancy -LRB- which ended in miscarriage -RRB- . Now , I 'm not saying that the vitamin is to blame , but I was alarmed by the amount of Vitamin E in these pills , which is a vitamin you do n't want to get too much of during pregnancy as it can cause serious defects -LRB- along with things like Vitamin A , which it also has a lot of -RRB- . Taking this prenatal along with the corresponding DHA Rainbow Lite pills gave me 130 IU of Vitamin E . The recommended daily intake of Vitamin E for a pregnant woman is only 22.4 IU !! The label even states it gives you 333 % of your DV of Vitamin E. No prenatal should be giving you more than 100 % DV on anything , except maybe folic acid . I agree with other posters also that red raspberry leaf is controversial being used early in pregnancy , and not something I would have taken if I had realized it ahead of time . I 've also heard of the problems with lead in these . I bought a different prenatal that gives only 15 IU of Vitamin E and nothing else exotic , to give room for my natural consumption of these vitamins in my diet . Again , I 'm not saying these vitamins caused anything , but I would be careful . Ask your Dr. if you 're not sure.Other , less important complaints for me were the fact that these really are huge horse pills , and I 'm not one to have problems taking pills . I 'm really good at it so it was n't too difficult , but they really do have a funky smell just like every other vitamin I 've tasted ... if I had problems with morning sickness I definitely do n't think I could have taken it .
 I started taking these because I am low on Vitamin D and they have added D2 so I thought it would eliminate having to take that pill too . I am currently trying to conceive and started getting heavy nausea in the afternoons after I would take it -LRB- I had to eat something first because my stomach tends to be sensitive when empty -RRB- . I thought `` Yeah ! I 'm pregnant , I have nausea ! '' But no . Turns out it was a side effect of the vitamins because it would happen almost every day about an hour after consumption . Boo . So now I am back to the drawing board for something that does n't upset my stomach . Although Rainbow Light does make my nails grow ! As with any prenatal , however .
 Did n't work out for me , but everyone woman is different so they may like these . Now taking Vitafusion gummies they are great , but do n't have Iron . OB gave me the ok though .
 These pills have all the things you could need in a prenatal plus the assurance that there are no harmful additives . Unfortunately for me they really upset my stomach . This is n't a usual reaction for me . I 'm taking them now while nursing my son . I took another store brand during my pregnancy with no reaction . But this one makes me sick almost every day . I 've tried taking it at all different times of the day but nothing works .
 First of all , the pills are huge ! They are difficult to swallow . Secondly , they made me sick . I was constantly going to the bathroom after I ate.They made going to the bathroom painful . Once I stopped taking them I no longer had issues . I would not recommend to my worst enemy !
 I am currently taking these pills . Yes , these pill are very big compaired to other prenatal vitamins and they leave a horrible taste in your mouth . No matter what I eat , the taste is still there . I dread taking these pill . I think this gave me an upset stomach , I did n't suffer from morning sickness until I started taking these pills . When I visit my doctor I will get a precription prenatal vitamin .
 I had to stop taking these vitamins because I would run to the bathroom in the middle of the night with severe stomach pains . It also caused pretty bad constipation . It may the level or form of iron but I had to switch because I could not tolerate them . I tried splitting the pill and taking it twice a day but I was still miserable . I switched to New Chapter Prenatal Vitamins and they are far better . I have more energy and no digestive issues with the New Chapter brand .
 These are horse tablets , ca n't get them down even with alot of liquid and I usually have no problem with pills .
 These pills are very large and thick and even cut in two , I found it difficult to shallow a pill cut in half . Since the pills are soft I would recommend that you grind the pill , using back of a spoon , into a powder and mix with something such as apple sauce or cottage cheese . If you attempt to shallow a whole pill make sure you have someone available to perform the Heimlich procedure .
 i 'm still in the process of trying different low carb bars , but i 'd have to say the atkins bars are the worst tasting . they taste like cardboard . blech ! and all the flavors taste almost exactly the same . AVOID !! the only good thing is that they act as a great appetite suppressant . after eating one , im not hungry for HOURS !
 Net carbs schmet carbs . This thing is loaded with carbs -LRB- 26g -RRB- ; that is 1 2/3 DAY 's budget for carbs in the atkins plan . - in ONE bar ! Carbs are carbs . Such thinly veiled deception just makes me mad . Amazon should enforce truth in advertising .
 I guess I should have known that at $ 9.99 a box that there would be something wrong with them ... I ordered the Smores and Mocha Crunch varieties of the Atkins Advantage bar , and when they arrived , I noticed that one of the boxes was past the expiration date -LRB- Dec 2004 -RRB- and the other is almost expired -LRB- Feb 2005 -RRB- . I ca n't believe that they can get away with selling expired food without advertising it as such . So , buyer beware ! You get what you pay for sometimes ! VERY DISAPPOINTED !!!
 These `` softgels '' are super hard and have a rough texture that makes them very hard to swallow . They 're the same size as the salmon oil capsules I 've been taking for many years , but those have always been slick and go down easily . I 'm going to find a previous brand and throw these away before I choke on one .
 I did n't even have to order any of this product to see that it is inferior . First , it only contains 150MG of Omega-3 fatty acids . Most high quality fish oil supplements will contain 3 or 4 times that . Plus that means you are paying for 850mg of `` other '' fish oil -- not the good Omega 3 kind . Plus it states the product is `` extracted solely from already harvested salmon using fish parts that would otherwise be wasted ... '' In other words , it uses parts of the fish that humans do not eat like the heads and organs . Good fish oil is made from the flesh of the fish . Avoid this product and buy some by a reputable manufacturer .
 I did n't notice any weight gain after having this for a month . I would not recommend this to anyone . Try some alternate brands .
 This product contains neurotoxin , cancer causing , bone marrow diminishing , human addictive Aspartame . Very dangerous . Will not buy this product again . Many weight gainers have it . Please be aware .
 Ok this will work on fresh spots , not older ones ! I got this for a shower door in a house we bought that obviously the previous owners did not clean well . DID nothing to the mold around the door frame . Not even lighten it ! I ended up using plain bleach , alot of scrubbing and then found a product from Menards by Rubbermaid that is a mildew/mold spray and that does work . Yes it has bleach in it too and smells , but so did this ! I used it to clean just regular soap scum and it kind of worked . Still not worth it . I gave it to my neighbor to use on outdoor furniture and she got nothing too so ... will not be ordering again .
 It really has to get me riled to write a review , but this vendor succeded . I have used the product for years with excellent results . Unfortunately the vendor sent me some very , very old product . So old that they were actually past their shelf life of 2 years . Instead of being dry powder crystal the contents of the packets were a slimy worthless gel . Next time I will buy direct from the manufacturer . The entire order was n't bad ; however , the plastic bottle seems to be OK .
 Seen the commercial and thought , wow . That stuff looks amazing . Up until I had bought myself some . Tried it on my boat . Fiberglass and vinyl seats . There were some rust spots . Did absolutely nothing . Did not work . Started walking around my house to see what it will work on . Tried my vinyl front door . Results were so so . Tried it on my exterior window sills . Again so so . Maybe I was expecting a miracle . Some soap and water with a little elbow grease would have accomplished the same . Do n't let the commercial fool you .
 After reading all the wonderful reviews , I decided to buy it for my bathroom tub . Other than the fact that the smell was unbearable , which I was ready to accept , the product did nothing to the few stains I had in my tub under the mat . Hope it works for others -LRB- and it looks like it does -RRB- ; but unfortunately , it did not work for me
 I ordered this product after seeing positive reviews ; however , upon receipt , the two bags of what should have been dry crystals or powder were completely wet , even though they arrived in manufacturer-sealed bags . It was impossible to use the product . I noticed another reviewer had the same issue .
 Product was supposed to be two packages of powder and a bottle . When received the two packages of powder was wet mush and one had broken and was all inside of the box . Contacted a very nice person at Instagone and he informed me that I was not the first to complain to them . It seems that &#34; As seen on TV products &#34; was selling their Instagone that was 8 years old . He was nice enough to replace the two packages and it worked as advertised . Never again will I buy anything from &#34; As seen on TV products &#34; .
 I bought this product a few months ago . It worked at the first 1-2 months , and then it did not stick together with skin any more . I was quite disappointed the quality of this tape .
 these caps were not real super x i have used these before and they worked these did not I need my money refunded
 No one seems to sell the old fashioned 3 t0 5 gallon jugs to catch a full day -LRB- or night -RRB- of output . Many males produce 3000 ml to 4000 ml within a 12 to 16 hour period.Does anyone know of a med supply who still produce and sell this size ?
 Tried several cans of this cr * p -LRB- only because Home Depot and Lowe 's no longer carry my favorite RAID Wasp and Hornet killer -RRB- and it works NOT at all . Went back to RAID when I found it ... and RAID Wasp and Hornet Killer is still the BEST on the planet - will knock a wasp or yellow jacket out of the air , straight down with no flyaway . Do n't waste your money on this Johnson crap.But why , oh why , is my Amazon page showing the Raid can for the Johnson SC Wasp/Hornet Killer ?
 I read the positive reviews about this product and I 've come to the conclusion that I must have SUPER BUGS ! I have a large nest of yellow jackets , -LRB- you know , the kind that likes to crawl into your soda pop can or make your life miserable at the zoo -RRB- . They built their nest under one of my eaves about 13 ' above the ground . I bought a can of this stuff and waited till dusk . First of all it fell far short of the 22 ' they claim . I was lucky to get 10 ' ! I had to get a ladder to get within 10 ' of the nest and then I soaked it , just like the instructions said I should . This is the next day now and they 're up there buzzing around like nothing happened , in fact I think they like the stuff ! Was the formula changed since all these positive reviews were left ? The ingredients on my can says
 Purchased this product to kill a pesky wasp hovering outside my balcony . After spraying the wasp multiple times directly with the spray , I watched it finally fall . Then , a few minutes later , it flew back , far angrier and looking for revenge . Finally , I dowsed the wasp with the spray while it was on the ground . It crawled around , not killed by the spray , but merely weighed down by the weight of the spray 's petroleum distillate . I ended up having to stomp the bug and get insecticide all over my shoes in the process.The spray is ineffective at killing wasps and mostly seems to anger them further . Perhaps the bugs down here are tougher than this spray can handle . The only thing this product was effective at was giving my favorite pair of sneakers a permanent petroleum smell .
 Claims to kill fleas . My cats brought some in just as we went on vacation . Upon our return , fleas were all over . We tried all the J&J flea killers . All worthless . By worthless I mean the fleas treated the pooling RAID products as a swimming pool , splashing around for apparent fun . When they got tired , they hopped away . We brought back the empty cans and demanded a refund .
 Why do n't you people consider putting a lid on this product , literally . The last two to three times I 've bought it , it was never sprayed ONCE before it hit the ground thanks to my puppy and the flimsy sprayer top busted and rendered it completely useless . I ca n't tell you how many bottles I 've put in the trash unused in the past few months . It was recommended that I use this product to defend my miniature dachshund from bully breeds on walks due to its spraying capacity of 20 + feet . I have probably bought it 5-7 times in the last three months and have not used it a single time for its actual purpose , but have had it busted before it could be of any use , thanks to a very enthusiastic puppy and your product not having a proper lid on it . Soon I 'm going to upload a video showing just how easy it is to bust the sprayer on this and that includes dropping the can on its side and not even remotely impacting the sprayer directly . I hope you 're paying your product packaging people what they seem to be worth , advising you to * not * put a lid on it , therefore ensuring -LRB- apparently -RRB- much more profit . Anybody else who has had the same problem , please respond to this review .
 I just keep kicking it off in my sleep - I ca n't seem to keep it on ... it seems to slide while I am sleeping and I wake up with it completely removed from my foot .
 went by the size chart but i think that it is to big , I 'm a 10 to 10.5 and i think this is to big to really pull the fore foot and toe to provide a proper stretch for the plantar tendon . it fall off of my foot a night or i 've got it so tight to try to get to work that i loose circulation to my foot . get something else .
 Why bother.Too flexible . When tightened enough to limit movement , it cuts circulation.Used for four nights with no results .
 i have had back pain with sciatica for few years.i have used other homeopathic drugs for flu and I found them somehow effective so , I thought it may work on my sciatica as well but it did not .
 I had severe Back and leg pain and took this product with no relief . I got an MRI which showed a lumbar disk causing nerve pressure.If you experience Sciatica type pains go see a spine Doctor as you possibly have a herinated disk .
 if you have sensitive skin dont even try it - I like the smell but it gave me a rash and does not work
 I followed the directions on the bottle . And it said to increase 2 capsules a night until you have three or more bowel movements a day . So I did , and I got up to 10 capsules - I did n't want to go past that . Then I woke in the middle of the night because of phenomenally sharp pain in my side ! I thought my appendix had burst ! Then I had diarhea for 3 days ! I had to miss work ! That pain in my side did n't go away for a week . I was really worried that this product damaged my insides.I 've tried several things since trying these . My advice to anyone is - if you are having this type of trouble , try elimation diets - start with gluten -LRB- wheat -RRB- and/or casein -LRB- milk -RRB- products . I have been gluten/casein/soy free for 2 months . And I go regularly 3 times a day with no fiber , no psyllium husk , no senna , no enzymes , no All-Bran , no Flax seed , no laxatives , no nothing ! Your body is constipated because it REALLY does n't like something you are eating ! I 've also been able to lose the weight I 've been struggling to lose .
 I did just what the directions said and all the cleanse did is give me the runs , not uncontrollable . I did not see anything abnormal or feel like it was doing what it claimed it does . For the money an expensive laxative !!!
 Either my bowels are in better shape than I thought or the product does not work for me . Basically caused my stomach to churn for 8 hours then out came water . I was afraid to use this on days I work because my position will not allow me to run to the restroom every 2 hours .
 I purchased this product with high hopes . I followed the directions precisely and still nothing happened but cramping and bloating . I added lemon as suggested , fasted and nothing but pain.I urge you not to spend your money on this .
 I am disappointed with this product after reading all the great reviews . I followed the directions to the letter , including taking fresh lemon juice to aid the reaction , etc. . As the directions state , taking 2 more each night until reaching 3-5 bowel movements the next day . I am up to taking 16 pills , and have yet to have more than 2 BMs the following day , and have lost at most 1 , maybe 2 lbs that I can directly attribute to this product , going from 245 to about 243 . My stomach/intestines/bowels do make some noise , and true to form , my BMs are liquified . Word of warning ... if you try this stuff and you feel the need to pass gas , do so at the very high risk of it not being just gas . Disgusting , I know , but I 'm just being honest and trying to let you know what you are getting in to here.I would have given one star , but since it did seem to help a little , I gave 2 stars.As far as the shipping ... I think I had the product 2-3 days after ordering , so no complaint there .
 This product made me feel alarmingly ill at the dose recommended , causing me to have safety concerns about which I will do some research of my own . You might want to beware of this seller -- initially they not respond to my email at all , then upon sending 2 more , asking about the satisfaction guaranteed policy , they finally responded saying that once you have opened it they will not consider refunding -LRB- even though the Oxy Powder company has a money back guarantee -RRB- . After that they did not reply at all to further questions on my part .
 I believed all these great reviews . I am sure some people like this product , but I found it toxic . I also do not appreciate the fake reviews.If you want rampant diarrhea and cramping , this is the product for you.To say this cleanses the colon walls when nothing else does is a joke . You need to take extra pancreatin or other enzymes for that . Just having rampant diarrhea will not cleanse your colon walls.This product is really overpriced . I rarely throw away supplements , but after trying it twice , I could not bear a repeat.I recommend doing a regular colon cleanse , taking triphala and also taking pro-biotics for chronic constipation . A good colon cleanse will also help to purify your blood and liver also . This product just can not do that .
 I bought oxy-powder with hi hopes , but just taking the first 4 pills gave me constant wet stools , I had diarrhea all the time , just fluid , no solid stools
 After reading all the claims , I spent money on this product that was totally wasted . Oxy powder gave me intense cramping and instead of helping my digestive track , it bound me up more . I ended up going to the doctor and getting a perscrption product just so I could get back to normal.I bought this on line and tried to return it and they refused .
 This product did not at all . Once I started to use it , I began to become constipated , and had to use a laxitive to get a bowel movement . I would not recommend this product to anyone .
 Total waste of money..........Oxy-Powder Colon Cleanse ... does zero nothing like throwing money in the trash ... Did nothing for me ... my work for others but not me ! ~
 I am so disappointed . Actually , I 'm calling the company tomorrow to get a refund . I followed all directions , changed dosage when it was n't working correctly , but it did not cleanse my system in any way . Do n't waste your money , a cheap laxative will do the same thing .
 This product is a complete waste of money . It does nothing more than a normal laxative can do , however the side effects are a lot worse . This product causes severe bloating and cramping . As the manufacturer tells you , it also causes loose stools . Do n't expect to travel far from a bathroom while you use this product -- you need to have it close by at all times , as your ability to hold your bowel movements in for longer than 30 seconds will be extremely compromised . Also , if you have a work out routine -- completely forget about doing it while on Oxy Powder -- you will not be able to work out for longer than 5 minutes without running to the bathroom . This is a complete waste of money .
 This is an expensive laxative . You will get the same results with cheaper options like Swiss Kriss , Miralax , magnesium citrate or eating handfuls of Concord grapes .
 I 've been taking Oxy Powder for 3 days , following all the prescribed recommendations -LRB- including the healthy diet -RRB- . I do n't know how it works for other people , but for me it causes a very obvious diarrhea . It makes me go to the restroom a couple of hours after I eat anything , I clearly see the pieces of what I ate in what comes out . I feel dehydrated -LRB- in spite of drinking lots of water -RRB- , dizzy , and have a very bad headache . Will not take it any more and will call them tomorrow to request a refund.This bad experience also made me browse for medical research article on colon cleansing . Surprisingly , I could not find any ... . On the contrary , it seems that our colon is typically nice , pink and clean , and no doctors or pathologists have ever observed a mucous plaque or anything of this kind . So I am not sure whether to trust the whole industry of colon cleansing products in general ...
 Disappointed with the results of this product . Will never purchase it again . Yes , it liquifies feces , but very little results.I was not happy with the product & felt it was not effective .
 I took this about a year ago , and I almost ended up in the emergency room . I was stuck in the bathroom at work for at least 15 mintues , with cramps that were so severe , I could n't even STAND UP and pull up my pants.I went directly to my doctor 's office when the cramps subsided - afraid I had done permanent damage by being stupid enough to take these pills . -LRB- and I took the recommended dosage -RRB- . Luckily , the cramps did n't come back and I threw away the remaining pills .
 I ignored the bad reviews . Now I realize my mistake . Oxy-Powder is not for everybody , and has the potential of making you very sick . Not worth it .
 I followed the directions exactly and the day after I started I was living in the bathroom with water running out of me . Not sure why , but I stopped because I could n't be confined to my house and bathroom . I tried it again some months later , and again , the same thing . Needless to say , I got very frustrated and threw these away .
 take it for two days caused me not continue to take more . just got gas and diarrhea . expect otherwise . not recommended at all . very disappointed . The page says you 'll have loose stools but I almost defecated water .
 It works , but just gives you complete diarrhea which I could have gotten for a lot less money by buying a laxative . So to say the least I am dissapointed .
 I have taken six tablets for four days . It has caused bloating , several small bouts of watery stools and no relief . I will continue it for a couple more days to see if bloating decreases . I 'm still looking for a helpful product without the cramping and bloating .
 I am very skeptical about all the hype about our colons and the toxins that are lurking . I decided to try a cleanser and this one claimed to be one of the best . The dose suggested is if I remember correctly , 4 pills at bedtime and if you did not get results , then you were to increase your dose to 6 pills . After the first night I got sick . Lets just say that I could not stop going to the bathroom . If I wanted to do that , then I would just eat a huge plate of mexican food . After this experience I doubt I will try another one .
 I ordered this product with high hopes , but after using a whole bottle I am still not sure about it . The ingredients on the website are described as `` high quality oxygen based '' , but after really reading through them , the ingredients seem very similar to a regular magnesium-based laxative . The directions say to take a large number of pills over the course of several days , and it 'll definitely make you go to the bathroom - but it has the same effect as a regular ole ' laxative , in that it causes your bowels to just retain a bunch of water so that the next day you go to the bathroom a bunch but it 's extremely watery.I have IBS/C and took Zelnorm , which WAS a miracle drug ... unfortunately it was taken off the market due to health concerns . I decided to try out this product to prevent/reduce bloating - but when I take it at night , the next morning I am SO BLOATED until I go to the bathroom like 5 times . If I only go to the bathroom once , I 'm still totally bloated - I guess from all of the water that has been sucked into my bowels as a result of taking the pills . I have found however , that taking 4 pills at night will make it easier to go to the bathroom the next day without all of the water.All in all , I 'd say take this stuff if you need a laxative - but it is not the `` miracle pill '' that it claims to be . I was pretty disappointed .
 I took all these capsules , and did not feel more energetic , do not believe my colon could possibly have been any cleaner , did not lose one ounce , felt bloated . Causes your bowels to just retain a bunch of water so that the next day you go to the bathroom a bunch but it 's extremely watery . Waste of time and money . I was very sick . I can not recommend this product
 I started taking this on Friday and had some watery bowel movements the next day . I thought I drank enough water but I think I was wrong . So on Saturday night , I took 5 instead of the recommended 6 . I had stomach pains before I went to bed and I woke up with the feeling of having to go but nothing came out . The next day I felt sick . I had body aches , a head ache and stomach pains . I felt like I had the flu . I drank tons of water but still felt dehydrated . I took off work the next day because I still felt sick.I guess that some people react differently but mine was a little extreme . I would not recommend to anyone . I never write reviews but I felt that this needed to be out there .
 I tried this product for about 10 days ... when I finally threw in the towel . Did n't work for me at all . However , I was able to send it back for a refund , which was great .
 Oxy-Powder Colon CleanseThis product is nothing more than a souped up laxative . Do not waste your money . It does not de-toxify or regulate . The product claims to produce three to five bowel movements the next day . It took three days to have any effect and then only produced one movement , and resulted in sever diarrhea later . I was left feeling the same afterward as I did before taking the product . I would not recommend this product to anyone .
 This product is advertised to be a colon cleanser . Yet when I received the bottle it says it is for constipation . This is not one of my problems . I took the product and then became what I thought was constipated . -LRB- loose stools -RRB- . I called the company and was told this is normal and to stick with it . Well , I took all these capsules , and did not feel more energetic , do not believe my colon could possibly have been any cleaner , did not lose one ounce , felt bloated . The company person said it works for 98 % of the people . IF this is so , I am one of the 2 % that it absolute did not work for . An absolute waste of time and money , and this is from a person who has used other colon cleansers and eats fresh , wholesome , foods , no meat and exercises regularly . It took me about four days to get back `` regular '' after trying this product . I can not recommend this product .
 Seriously , this is a total rip-off . Go to youtube and search about this product . Watch the `` doctor 's '' presentations ... so tacky and an obvious scheme . Do yourself a favor , steer clear . I sent mine back . . all it does is give you nasty diarrhea . I tried it for 4 days and then researched the product . Total scam . The seller was fast and reliable , however the product is garbage ... and overpriced .
 This just did not work , and i tried and tried and tried , i added lots and lots of lemon to water and drank it on a very empty tummy late at night before bed , nothing , tried it in the AM same thing nothing , i upped my dosage ... nothing . well to be fair a little watery diarheah came out but not much ... i have to say i am sticking w / my swiss kriss ... never lets me down , works in just hours . and costs only $ 9 online , lasts 2 months , but this would last maybe a few weeks given i took like 9 a day ... and still did not work , too expensive , and since i got from an `` independednt ebay distributor '' at retail cost mind you who tells me she wont uphold the money back guarantee , i called the main company and they wont help me either , nothing . thats pathetic . really is . Have receipt for full price of $ 42.95 plus shipping costs , from their own distributor and they cant uphold the guarantee , which they offer 60day guarantee to customers . oh well . crappy company , hate the pills and dont like the way they treat their customers ... wherever they purchase .
 I was disappointed in this product . I took it as directed . It gave me diarrhea .
 After taking this product for only 7 days ... I coughed up blood ! I had to be taken to the emergency room ... DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !
 It only seals if the bowl is al least 1/2 inch smaller , but then the edge hangs over making it hard to put in and take out of the fridge . I really wanted something I could put over a bowl and take to work for lunch -LRB- in a bag -RRB- so it 's useless for that . It is OK for storing stuff in the fridge . I have n't needed to try it as a cooking lid so do n't know how it works for that .
 This thing stunk to high hell . And I tried everything to un-stink it . Baking soda , vinegar , time in the sun , time in the cold . It 's just a very chemical smell that does n't go away . So I threw it away . I 'm sorry , but this reflects on Doc Johnson Company . Hence , they are off my list for any future purchases for even letting something like this hit the retail market at all .
 The product might work , but it doesnt taste that good , so it 's hard to drink . It 's better if you mix it with the actual fruit . The are a few recipes on the box that give you some pretty good ideas , but even with that it 's not the best tasting smoothy
 DLPA is an Amino Acid supplement for adults which is supposed to elevate your mood , decrease your pain and help with alleviating symptoms of arthritis , depression , menstrual cramps and migraines.I have taken it several times and believe it has the potential to do what it claims . Unfortunately it upset my stomach and so I was unable to give it more than a brief trial run .
 I honestly bought this product because I thought it worked like ipecac , and would help me to throw up if I feel gross ... but unless you have to drink a WHOLE lot , it does n't work that way . It could be just because I did n't take a lot each time I 've tried it , but I 'm not sure .
 I could not even put my feet in the stockings . They are absolutely worthless unless you have a trained person to put them on you and take them off . I wanted them for circulation problems . This did not work at all , since I could not even get them on at all . They are not good for elderly persons , as elderly persons do not have the strength to stretch the stockings onto their feet or legs . The stockings were entirely too tight for my purposes . Jobst have said no return on the items . I have n't put them on since I could not stretch them with my hands in order to put them on my feet or legs . I am totally disheartened by this whole episode . They have been totally unused , not even tried on , as they were too tight .
 Based on the first week of use , I have to say I 'm disappointed . There are 2 problem areas - first , the adjustment screw for the flame does n't work right ; second , the valve for refilling the lighter with butane seems to leak badly . Maybe I 'm just not doing it right , but I 've tried to figure out a way to refill & just seem to keep getting leaks . Also , I ca n't tell how much butane is getting in - probably not much since the lighter does n't keep the flame for long .
 These batteries are incredibly bad . I bought them for my Nikon Sb-800 speedlight . Since they are 2900 mAh , I thought I was going to get outstanding results . I did not.I 've used Impact 2900 mAh , Enegizer 2500 mAh , and several other 2700 mAh AA batteries . Results were fine . But thses Power 2000 batteries died almost immediately . I could n't believe it was the batteries because it was so quick . I thought my SB-800 went bad . But , I replaced the batteries and sure enough , all was well.Don ' t buy Power 2000 batteries . They are very bad .
 These batteries discharge at a measured rate of 100mA/day or more . Even fully charged with a good charger they wo n't even turn on any of my digital cameras . The stated capacity is totally fake . I can assure this after having tested three different models , all AAs
 I regret to say that this product by Childlife , in particular is too strong . I purchased this product for my toddler and eight year old son who could n't stand it . I tried it out for myself , and ended up tossing it in the trash . Granted , some might actually take well to it , just like the previous reviewer . However , we were n't one of the lucky ones .
 My child took the essential fatty acids for 4 or 5 days and complained of a stomach . As soon as he quit taking them , his stomach settled .
 it does not stay cold very long or warm . i would not recommend this . it is also very cold to the outside of the so i just put it on my forehead . a damp towel and a ziplock bag of ice is a better and cheaper solution
 *** My Revised Review : -LRB- 1 star -RRB- CAN I STILL RETURN THIS ITEM PLEASE ? -LRB- Today is Feb 13 , but my return policy was ended on Feb 10 , only 3 days ago -RRB- . The hot pack is not working anymore , after I put in microwave , when I got it our there was a HUGE bubble of air or something inside it , and it was scary . I let it cool down and the bubble is gone , but the surface is not smooth as before . I would be appreciated if you let me return this item now . *** My first Review : -LRB- 3 stars -RRB- I got this for my dry eyes . It keeps the heat very good , like for 5 minutes . but its not in direct contact with eyes , there is a little space . However , it is very tightly touching around my eyes , and kinda burning . I heated in microwave for 20 sec as instruction said.I like the idea of rubber band used in this product . Also keeps the heat long enough . But I dont recommend for DRY EYES .
 This thing works reasonably well as a hot -LRB- dry -RRB- mask . However , the product description at Amazon says that it can be heated in the microwave oven `` or even hot water , '' so my intention was to use it dampened . The directions that came with the device say `` do not get the product 's wet . '' The two directions seem to be mutually exclusive . It is not worth my time to send it back , but if you want to use it for moist heat -- forget about it .
 I was really looking foward to using my gel mask , with it 's happy , spongy feel . I froze it for a week until one day I needed it.It stayed cool for about twenty minutes . That was all . The fabric took on the small of my freezer.And then it fell apart . The stitching that held the outer cover onto the inner gel came unstitched . Not a great product .
 If you like freezing your corneas , but want to maintain that baggage around your eyes , then this product is for you . I do n't know if there is a shortage of product testers where this was made , but this is clearly an awful design , and it loses it 's cool in less than 10 minutes . Stick with a damp cloth .
 For now this gets a 1 star because there 's a giant part on the top that is n't even stitched . If this is intended then I apologize and will change this to a better rating , but it looks odd to me . And it 's not mentioned anywhere about there being a giant part that is n't stitched closed . It 's kind of in the middle but more to the left a little bit . And also when the product came the velcro part of the strap was stuck to the blue gel part -LRB- the side you put on your face -RRB- and even while gently pulling it off it managed to damage it a little bit . While that 's a bummer , the biggest issue for me is the stitching at the top . As far as I 'm aware there 's no reason to ever take it out of it 's pouch so why would it be like that ? I hope they did n't send me a used product ...
 This mask is worthless if you plan on using it as a cooling mask . You can put it in the freezer for weeks and it will only stay just barely above room temperature for about ten minutes . Save your money . Buy a bag of frozen peas and put that on your eyes . Frozen peas are dirt cheap and they actually work at cooling hot fatigued eyes .
 I prefer to deal with allergy problems without using drugs.Heat works best , for me.I bought 3 heat-delivering products at the same time.This worked great the first 3 or 4 times.Then , the 4th or 5th time I tried it , part of the edge came unsewed.I think it 'll work again if I hand-sew it shut , butI 'm afraid to use it til then.How long do we think it 'll be til I get around to that ? This decade or next ?
 my daughter complained that it did not stay cold very long . On the fist use the seams began to unravel . By the third use the gel pack was coming out . We returned it and bought a different one .
 Most uncomfortable , digs in , falls down , does not hold them up , would not recommend them to anyone , useless and overpriced , would like my money back
 These are horrible and a complete waste of money ! As soon as I put them on they slid down . There is nothing to keep them up on their own . Do n't buy these unless you plan on getting a garter with them -LRB- yuck ! -RRB- I bought the ones with the silicone top and they work a bit better - still not great but better .
 I bought this pad for my 4 1/2 year old 's bed as she is still working on staying dry through the night . Changing sheets a few times a week was getting rough and so I opted to try a sheet protector.I failed to notice that this one was so small . It would fit a twin bed , but only covers about 2/3 the width of her full sized bed . The pad has nothing to help it stay in place at all , so it bunches up.It 's difficult to imagine it being comfortable even for an adult who might stay a bit more still during sleep.I liked the idea of this but found it disappointing once put to use .
 I purchased this item for a family member several years ago , and have not used it very much because it seems more flimsy and less comfortable than others that we own . The real problem is that it retains odors after usage , despite washing and soaking in baking soda . The only way I can get the odor out is to spray the pad with an odor-eliminator spray . We have other pads , inclulding some made by this same company , where odors wash out easily and completely with nothing more than detergent . Perhaps they have improved this since I purchased it , but based on my experience I would not recommend this item .
 The minute I opened the package I was bowled over by the strong chemical smell . I opened it up thinking it would air out some , but it did not , so I returned them . -LRB- I 'd bought 2 . -RRB- Did n't want to take the chance of washing/drying them in case the smell did n't go away , then I would n't be able to return them , so I do n't know if the smell goes away in time after washing , but considering how strong it was I doubt it .
 I have two issues with this product :1 -RRB- Uncomfortable - poor design has extra velcro -LRB- not used to hold the collar on you -RRB- poking out and scratching at your throat .2 -RRB- Does n't absorb the cold very well - a can of Coca Cola in the refrigerator for 20 minutes is way colder than this pack is after sitting overnight in a chest ` deep freeze ' freezer.A cold wash rag wrapped around your neck and covered with a towel would be just about as effective , more comfortable , and more convenient . I suppose this would be useful to someone who is extremely sensitive to cold packs and does n't mind red scratch marks on their neck .
 I bought this to use as a cold pack . The collar just feels cool at best , even immediately after taking it from the freezer , when it 's been there overnight.Just so so fit , too . Rides high on back and away from neck.Didn ' t try it for a hot pack , it might be better for this .
 I have order thousands of items from Amazon , and I believe this is one of the very few times I have had to write a negative review . This product was not worth the money I paid for it , and did n't not work very well at all . I tried to return the product , but I was told since I froze the item I was no longer able to return the product . I asked the vendor how would I know if the product worked it I did n't freeze it?I would not recommend ordering this product . There are far better products for less money .
 I loved the idea of this product , and it does fit nicely -LRB- although it 's a little big for my neck , but I 'm a small woman -RRB- which is the only reason I give it two stars instead of one star . This product simply does not get cold enough , and the little bit of chill it does reach , only lasts for 10 minutes at most . Same goes for the heating . As well , I recently put it in the microwave for 2 minutes to heat it up as directed , and on one of the creases , the gel/plastic somehow started to burn , pop and smoke . We also purchased the wrap around version for your leg , and it used a different type of polyester material -LRB- the neck one was cotton -RRB- to house the gel pack , and that material is completely snagged from the velcro strap and looks awful after only a few uses . If we could , we 'd return them .
 This item advertises to be exactly what cervical neck pain sufferers need but it does not live up to its description.The concept is excellent but the fit is awkward , complicated and does not hold the cold or really get that cold . The add says 20F but I seriously doubt it . Other reviews mention it not staying warm either . We thought the cold might be more lasting but it was n't . Try something else .
 This looked like the perfect solution to early morning neck pain . Wrong . What it is is a non-messy alternative to real ice packs that will provide a bit of coolness for a short period of time . Back to the ice bags for me .
 Much easier to wrap baggies of ice in a towel , or use a heating pad . More effective too . I expected more .
 Hi AllI thought they were the right cold pack because I was looking for some way to close the ends . This product does that , but the only problem is that I left the cold pack overnight in the freezer and It did n't stay cold for twenty minutes on my neck . Very dissapointing
 Just like the other reviewers - I agree - it will not stay Hot or Cold for very long.However I seem to have a different problem . I have A SHORT NECK ! I am heavy set - so I am sure that contributes to the `` problem . `` Well having a short neck causes it to raise up off my shoulders and wo n't close properly around my neck.As you can see , it is very high around the collar/chin area . My ear lobes are pushed up and it is very uncomfortable shoved up behind my ears.Also , the back sides and back is raised up ALMOST HALF WAY UP the back of my head!Look at the picture closely , and picture that on a `` squatty neck person . '' Having a short neck really does lift the whole thing OFF your shoulders , smash your earlobe up and UP the backside of your head !!! It does not lay flat on the back of a short necked persons bsck . Only the very lower portion of the Gel Pack touches the back AT ALL.Isn ' t this supposed to be for the neck and down the back area?While shoved up like it does , it creates a `` HOLLOW '' all around inside and underneath . Therefore , no gel pack or what little heat it has is touching the skin on or around the neck of `` a SHORT NECKED PERSON ! `` One is also aware of the front closure choking and strangling them!Also the Velcro tab is sewed up so high on the front of the collar that the edge STABS and IRRITATES under the chin.This product has too many design flaws to make it worth the asking price for a neck therapy product.HOWEVER
 I 've seen a couple other reviewers write this , but I just wanted to echo their sentiment . Elasto-gel never gets cool enough to be therapeutic , no matter how long you leave it in the freezer .
 Great concept , but it feels like a whip-lash neck brace . I ca n't wear it long enough to get the benefit without feeling clastrophobic . I still use it , just not secured around my neck . Could be very useful for wrapping a knee or shoulder though . If I turn it upside down , it snuggles around the neck much nicer .
 For years I 've used a gel wrap made by Medi-Temp for my chronic neck pain which I love because it is ICY cold . I purchased the Elasto Gel because of the good reviews and because it looked like it would cover more of the neck and back area . I am extrememly disappointed in the Elasto Gel 's temperature . Even after overnight in the freezer it feels more like a cool washrag out of the refrigerator rather than an Ice pack . If I 'm not able to return it , mine will soon be available on Ebay .
 I have the elasto gel eye thing , 4 '' roll and the foot wrap . . All are great . The cervical neck thing is crap . It has a cotton cover unlike the others and barely gets cold even after you lay it on yourself for a while and it 's not comfortable with the elastic attached . Do n't buy ! I wish I could return it . Try the cervical by chattooga col pac , I have two I luv .
 This looked perfect for me , as it seemed like the gel , type I have had before - but it does not hold the heat or cold.No help at all .
 Great seller and fast shipping , but product not useful at all . If you want cold , get an ice pack . If you want heat , get heat patches . If you want to keep re-heating a heavy awkward thing that must be sealed or even humidity will ruin it , then buy this piece of junk . The heat lasts 15 minutes at best . Useless .
 I purchased this product to use on my neck for my Herniated disc problem . It might stay cold for a 1/2 hour . It also is n't very cold to the touch . Gel packs from your local pharmacy will work allot better and cost less !
 I thought this product would be great compared to simple ice packs which we have to hold with our hand onto the sore spot . However this just does not get cold enough . Its only mildly cold , not ice cold - which is required for treating pains.plus the package is bulky . I wish they could make is slimmer less heavy .
 I am very disappointed in this item . I bought for an ice collar and it is not cold , cool but not cold . Additionally it is very uncomfortable but in all fairness I used it at night in bed , may be more comfortable when up .
 I am a pediatric physical therapist who suffered whiplash when rear-ended in a car accident . This sounded like a great product . Ordered it and was disappointed . My frozen bag of peas does a better job . It does n't get cold enough to numb the back of my neck . Will be paying to send this back but it 's a waste of money .
 I 've been ordering Elasto-Gel collars for years for a friend who suffered a neck injury . Elasto-Gel collars have two different types of covers
 I 'm sorry to write such a negative review , but the maker messed up and this product is going back . The box and bag clearly and in large WARNING letters say `` DO NOT GET WRAP WET '' , `` IF THE PRODUCT BECOMES DAMP , FULLY AIR DRY IT BEFORE CONTINUING USE '' , and in smaller letters , `` Do not use wet towels under the gel '' . So exactly how do you do moist heat , if you need to stop as soon as the gel gets `` damp '' and `` fully air dry before continuing use '' ? This product should not be advertised as being suitable for moist heat until it is fully sealed in something that completely protects the gel from moisture.Also very important , what happens when you break a sweat under the pad ? I 'm not by any means a chronic sweater , but it 's a heating pad and that is just part of the deal . My current heat therapy device is fully sealed in plastic so it can be washed for hygienic reasons , and that 's just common sense in action.Further , heating compounds tends to release chemicals , so covering the wonder-gel with something known to be safe for human contact after heating would be highly advisable to avoid the possibility of giving people allergic reactions to whatever the gel is made of .1 star and I 'd give it 0 if I could for wasting my time and shipping costs . Do n't cut important things that a customer would happily pay for because you are trying to hit a price point you made up in your offices .
 the inflatable pump traction device is much better , this does not stablize your neck well and is uncomfortable . It just feels like it strangles your neck but it does not keep it in place .
 So this Mueller shoulder therapy was not what I originally ordered . I ordered the Elasto-gel cervical collar . I was sent this Mueller SHOULDER cold/hot therapy ... even though returned -LRB- twice , because my replacement was the same wrong item -RRB- I can tell you it is a cheap not what you are looking for product . The material is the basic pull on brace type . The hot cold pack looks like the type you crush to activate , although it is suppose to last awhile . If you need something that last and rocks , look at the Elasto-gel products . I ordered the cervical collar for my husband . It to me seems like it does not get that cold , but he begs to differ . He has chronic neck pain due to an old softball injury and still plays so aggravates it all the time . He loves the flexibility . He wraps it on and goes to bed !!
 I bought this Cervical Collar and it sucks . . It never gets coid enough and what cold it does have quickly dissipates . . total waste of $ $ $
 The weight of this pack is too much for me to stand keeping it on my neck when it is sore and the strap is very scratchy and uncomfortable . Even after being in the freezer for more than a day it did n't stay cool very long . It also has the strangest smell . I regret purchasing this item .
 I was never able to get this to fit comfortably . Then , possibly because of the poor fit , it never seemed cold enough to offer me relief . I 've only tried it cold . Perhaps it works better hot . It is good for a flat surface like your back , shoulder blade or legs . But I did n't think it worked well as a cervical collar . I do much better with the $ 1.50 rectangular gel packs .
 frozen overnite & when taken out of freezer , only was cold for 1-2 minutes.heat was a little better.it fit really well , better than it held cold & heat ...
 itwas a fast easy transaction i was just disappointed in the item itself it only stays cold for a very short time and i was hoping for something longer lasting thanks for the prompt service though .
 This item has a couple of faults , which is why I only gave it two stars . The first , glaring weakness is that it does n't get cold enough to consider it ice therapy . I did n't purchase this item with heat therapy in mind , so if that 's what you 're looking for then this review is not for you . But if you are looking for the same type of therapy as putting an icepack on your neck , then look elsewhere . It gets very cool , but not ice cold . The second problem is that this thing is a little too large , and I have a larger than average neck for a man .
 The product description for this item said no sweeteners , that was the primary reason I went with this brand . Beware , fructose is the second listed ingredient ! It 's super sweet tasting , too sweet really . My kids love it and I 'm going to use the whole bottle , but I 'll be buying an actual sugar-free vitamin-C next time .
 We used this on our son 's -LRB- 4 year-old -RRB- bed . The few accidents he had this product proved to not work -LRB- naturally he has a brand new mattress -RRB- . Perhaps this is waterproof for a drop of water ... It is nice and soft but if it can not handle an accident what is the point . Not a good product for us and I can not recommend this .
 The sheet itself would have been fine , but when we took the plastic wrap off the new sheet we found larvae of some sort inside which had eaten a couple of holes in it .
 I will be returning this pad unused , while the description says polyester the package states vinyl backing . It does indeed have the tell tale smell of vinyl . I bought this for my son due to bed wetting issues and refuse to have this toxic substance off-gas while he sleeps
 Pad does what it is generally designed to do
 I opened the box containing the TWO pads that I purchased and on both packages is a sticker stating
 It does seem to protect the mattress ... when it is n't moved by my son . It does NOT tuck into the twin mattress so if my son takes a while to go to sleep or moves it , it is useless . I bought 2 but would not buy again . I 'd find a larger one that tucks .
 I bought two of these for my 3 year old son 's bed , but when I received them , there was a sticker on the back that said they were not for use by children under age 12 . It would be helpful to have this in the description .
 this is NOT WATERPROOF.I had such high hopes for this ... i liked the size and fit nicely on a full bed.but after day 1 , it soaked thru this pad , thru the sheets , thru the mattress pad , and right onto the actual mattress . Pretty worthless .
 The first time I used this product I ended up with not only wet sheets but a wet matress . I will be returning this product . It might work if woken up when the wetting occurs but will not retain the moisture.It is not water proof at all .
 I ordered these pads for my 2-year-old based on the generally positive reviews , and was very disappointed . While they were a great fit for his bed and provided the coverage I was looking for , the first time he had a major leak it went right through the pad into the mattress cover below , and when I washed the pad it essentially disintegrated in the washer . Perhaps I had a defective pad , but I ca n't recommend this pad in any way shape or form based on its complete lack of performance .
 This pad moves around a lot . It does not stay in place and that is a problem if you want to use it on top of your sheets .
 Label says not for use by children under the age of 12 . I would assume it has something to do with the thickness of the pad and SIDS . Amazon should state this on their site . Returning it .
 Item arrived promptly . Contained odd warning about not using with children , but others have commented on that.Physically it appeared to match product description.The first time I used it , I was pleased to see that although it had gotten wet overnight , it felt dry to the touch on top . So my child was clean and comfortable.Changing the bed later I discovered WHY it was clean and comfortable on top - it leaked through completely and the bedding underneath was soaked through.I do not recommend this product if you are trying to prevent moisture from reaching the bedding or the mattress . It did keep my child dry , but other options do both .
 I should have taken previous reviews more seriously . I purchased two of these for an elderly parent with incontinence issues . Although the product looks and feels nice , it does not stay in place while in use . It moves every time my mother moves and is a source of discomfort and annoyance to her . Disappointing purchase .
 It does n't work more than scrubbing with water alone . The fact that there are no ingredients listed on the label should be a red flag .

 Purchased this item to remove grease from wool/oak kitchen cabinets.Three cleanings still did not remove all of the grease .
 The product was purported to remove dirt and gunk . I tried it several times on kitchen cabinets that are soiled on the door only , and it did NOTHING !!!
 The only reason I purchased this product was to remove the sticky residue off my cabinets that are near my stove . I used the product and tried with all of my might to get the grease out to no avail ... waste of money . Might work for making your cabinets shine but not for cleaning as stated on the bottle . I guess castor oil is my next purchase .
 This shave gel -- while featuring a manly , alluring scent that some ladies will like -- burns like hell ! Definitely not for sensitive skin .
 I was so excited to receive the Caldrea Basil Blue Sage Stainless Steel Spray in the mail . Of course , the first thing I did upon delivery was to try it out on my stainless steel refrigerator -LRB- the very reason I bought the product -RRB- . Like most facial products I invested in , this product will join their company in the back of cabinets . After the first use , like all the other similar products I have tested , my refrigerator was left with film and smears . Even though I worked it in and tried `` polishing '' the stainless steel , I was left disappointed and frustrated . I have recently learned that the best way to maintain beauty and shine for stainless steel appliances is by cleansing the surface with a mild dishwashing detergent and then using extra virgin olive oil to protect and polish the stainless steel . The results are better than any products I have come across . The seller is dependable ; the product was disappointing . I hope this is helpful .
 I bought this for my stainless steel refrigerator . This products does not work , I had streaks all over when I was done .
 if you want pad this is the one only cover the top portionif you want whole protector where it encapsulates the whole thing . this is not it .
 The picture appears to have a pulse oximetry with it ; which it did not . I ordered the oral therometer but received the ear one . I had to send it back because of this and that was over 2 weeks ago and still have not received the credit on my card . Very disappointed with the advertising , not with the monitor as I ended up buying one from my usual vendor and it works great .
 I have severe allergies to dust and dust mites . I ordered this , thinking that it was the cure for sneezing and stuffy nose at night . Wrong ! Did n't help at all . Only thing that cured the dust mite problem was a temper-pedic 1 1/2 inch foam mattress . It 's so dense that nothing can get through it . I no longer wake up in the middle of the night with allergy problems.Invest in a temper-pedic , it 's worth the investment for a full nights sleep .
 I bought these thinking maybe I could get the same benefit of the new Sketchers or Reebok work out shoes , but after trying both , I can tell you that these insoles do absolutely nothing !! I wore them around the house over the course of two days , and other than feeling nice , I felt no difference with or without them on . I 've gone to shoe stores and have tried on both Sketchers and Reeboks versions ... and even though they may look a bit odd , the Sketchers are definitely the ones to go with . I will be buying those asap !
 After one use the tips of my toes are blistered ! Granted , I have the kind of feet where the second toe is longer than my big toe but it 's not a problem for the other insoles I 've used . These insoles put your feet in a downward position ... like a mini heel inside your shoe . Because of that , your toes are pushed to the front of your shoe the entire time you 're walking or jogging . I literally took my shoes off and walked the rest of the way home , barefoot ! I came home and put my Spenco cross-trainer insoles back into my shoes and it felt like a dream once again ! I think these insoles would be much better if they extended the length of the shoe so your feet were protected all the way down , like normal insoles . I will be happy to send them to you if you 'd like to lose a toenail too , like I 'm clearly about to do ! : -RRB-
 These are a little cushion that is comfortable to wear in a loose shoe . They do not do anything else as far as anti-cellutlite effect while wearing . I would not buy again .
 I put off buying a pair of sneakers for these insoles . Bad choice . They really hurt the back of my foot . My heels are cracked and on fire every time I walk with these . A shame because I do feel the burn in my legs as they 're working . I just ca n't take the pain they produce . I think they really do n't stay in place at the back of the shoe and they seems to slide forward . My foot is always stepping at the edge of the insole which is the hardest upward part . I need to return them !
 They had stains on them when I received them ... . they do absolutely NOTHING that they say they would ... You can get a better sole at the drugstore -LRB- Dr Scholls -RRB- for less then $ 10 . They make a squeaky noise when I walk too , very annoying .
 I ordered for this item and I never received it . I sent the seller message twice , and it took them forever to reply . I am quite dissappointed because I was so looking forward to receiving this item . I might just buy Dr. Scholl 's .
 This is just another cushioned insole for your shoes . It is no better than those found in pharmacies and theirs is half the price of the `` Smartsole '' .
 These insoles seemed like a great idea to me . However , they did n't work in any of my shoes . Raised my foot up too high out of shoes and were just not comfortable . You need to take the entire inside of your own shoe out to try to fit this in . Today 's shoes come with so many nice insoles that putting these in just defeated the purpose .
 These insoles did n't fit into any of my shoes very well . I figured they would have best chance of fitting in my Nikes , I removed the insole from my shoes , put these in , and could n't even make it out the front door they were so uncomfortable . The plastic on the bottom is very hard and hurt part of my foot since it would n't lay right in my shoes . I definitely would not recommend these .
 THESE INSOLES DONT WORK . I FEEL NO DIFFERENCE WHEN I WALK USING THESE INSOLES . SAVE YOUR MONEY
 I had hoped for more . I wore these daily and I got more out of walking in a good pair of flip flops . Not for me.Lisa in Alabama
 I knew going in that ` reducing cellulite ' was a joke but I did think I 'd enjoy some additional benefits over any other insole . I was wrong . They are comfortable and the cushion is nice but otherwise , they do nothing .
 Another reviewer said these were just ordinairy shoe inserts , I got them anyway and I agree . I own Shapeups which are fantastic . As far as insoles , I think the Dr. Scholl 's for back pain are the best I 've ever tried and cost less then the Smartsoles .
 Not `` negative heel technology '' as stated in the original description - which has now changed - these are way over-priced & provide nothing more than a little extra cushioning .
 These are nice good quality insoles , but I do n't see them doing anything else for me at this time , maybe this will change over a few more months of wear or something but as of right now all I have is new insoles . Felt nothing like `` a burn '' etc on my legs or anywhere else . Not saying they are not a good product , just not worth the price for a set of insoles for your shoes .
 I could not use these , walking in them was fine but the next day my back would hurt so bad ! Sent them back .
 I had an allergic reaction to one of the extra ingrediaents . Having taken saw palmetto for over 20 years , this version produced an itchy rash requiring treatments . Maybe Pygeum ? Or other . I tossed them out
 the battery that came installed in the product was corroded . as a result , the product is non functional as it was damaged by the chemical secreted from the baterry . i recommend when packaging the product , do not preinstall the battery.one of the floss head came with a broken thread.better quality checks should be perform before the product is placed on the retail market .
 The flosser never worked properly from the moment it arrived . The installed battery had badly corroded , and , despite cleaning the contacts with alcohol and installing a new battery , it still would not function .
 The item only worked for 1 week . When I opened it up the battery was corroded and I eas unable to get it to work .
 The item i bought did not work the battery had leaked inside the package . The troubling part is that the person who packed the item could see this and sent it to me anyway . Other than that i like the product -LRB- I already had one -RRB- this one was a stocking stuffer that did not make it to the stocking . I would like another one sent to me -LRB- one that works -RRB- .
 It seemed like it might be a great product , but I bought it for my mom whom has a hard time handling those little disposible flossers . I was n't expecting to be so little and it does n't really work for her . She dropped it one of our dogs got it , it was barely damaged and would not work anymore at all . They only chewed the disposible part . It should n't of broke so easy . Also the button is hard to push .
 Only one of the two flossers that I ordered worked . The battery exploded in one of the units , and the other flosser is not up to speed ... runs very slow . Tried new batteries but that did n't help . However , these flossers are the best when you can find one that works 100 % .
 This device arrived with it 's battery and wires caked with corrosion . Obviously it had been standing around for a long time without use . It failed after a week . I cleaned out the junk and replaced the battery . It now seem to work , but I do n't know for how long .
 This little flosser is great , while it works . My son got one and for the 3 or 4 months it worked it was great . When it stopped working -LRB- yes , I tried a few new batteries -RRB- I contacted Oral B -LRB- owned by P&G . They were kind enough to send me a coupon for free floss . They said the Hummingbird was in this group . No one sells it anywhere around . Ever try to use a Mfg. coupon online ? It wo n't work . I contacted them about it and they said they were sorry , but they could n't send anything but the coupon .
 This is one of the worst products I have ever bought . The tips are expensive and do n't stay attached to the machine very well . I have to constantly re-attach the tip as I floss .
 if could be gotten locally i would recommend it . On line the one I got was a bad deal and too much work trying to retrn or fix .
 I have a cedar mop for over 2 years . And bought the refill from Dept , Store , last us 2-3 years but just was too dirty.This refill we received was immediately unraveling at the seam of the garter after ONE use . I expected that this productwas going to be the same as my old one because it is made by CEDAR too.I have to use my old one and just maybe look around at dept store.again.The product has a very poor quality and workmanship .
 I loved the idea , but was very disappointed that 1/2 the case of 12 was not working!Without the light , it is not exciting to my littlr girl and loses it 's purpose.Disappointed.Stacey
 I bought this as a gift for a family member . She did n't it find it to work at all . I was wondering why it had been reduced so much in price . She sent it back . I do n't think it 's worth anyone 's time to buy it then send it right back .
 This machine was quite a disappointment . It vibrates so strongly , even on the lowest setting , that it was painful . I 'm no sissy but I could n't stand it for more than a minute . It is also noisy and there is no heat ... I returned it and I 'm still on a search for a decent foot massager . Totally overpriced and worthless to me .
 I loved this until the plastic pieces started breaking off . The plastic screw caps on the top broke off after about a year of light use -LRB- 2-3x a week for 15 mins -RRB- . When the screw caps broke off , the whole plate lifted and vibrated noisily and exposed the electronics underneath . It seemed too dangerous to use after that and had to be discarded . Needless to say I am disappointed with the quality .
 No idea what system this is for . It does n't fit the system . It 's a big white plastic container with slots . In no way is it used with the kaboom cleaner . .
 ... but this product does n't work at all for me -- my clothes are cotton , and I remove them from the dryer ASAP , but still end up ironing -LRB- not a horrific thing , just not what I expected from this product 's claims -RRB- . Every item of clothing has looked exactly the same after following the directions .
 I bought these when I ran out of my other brand of B-12 . This B-12 is in the form on cyno cobalamin , which is not easily utilized by the body . The better form is methyl cobalamin . They are sub lingual , which is good and the taste is ok . If they work for you great , but I 'll stick with the other form .
 This item was sent me as a re-oder and I did not order them . Would not have re-ordered them . I had not choice but to keep them . Did not know how to send them back . Other b-12 vitimans are better
 This seemed like a great idea but when I received the item I realized the &#34; seeds &#34; move all around without borders sewn to keep them in their place . Therefore , it is quite the hassle to spread it all out evenly . In the picture it appeared there were quilted squares and I assumed each section held the seeds in place . not so .
 this heat pack does not hold its heat as well as others I have had . Also although it appears in the picture that it is sewn in sections it is not . As a result the material inside slides to the bottom making it uneven if you try and use it sitting upright . I 'm also not nuts about the aroma .
 Very small viewing area and the light went out almost immediately . Waste of money .
 I received the product -LSB- OWL LITE -RSB- and found the light that makes the magnifier an `` OWL LIGHT '' was inoperative . I sent an email to retailer . Their comment was to ask if twisting the card helped -LSB- they were very familiar with the product -RSB- and of course it did not work and why should you twist a credit card light when it was made to use with one hand ????? I sent the product back and it was refused by the retailer.I am now familiar with this particular product and after trying several at a nearby retailer , found they ALL did not light.POOR PRODUCT . POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE .
 This is a product to pass up . The light activation button is difficult to use . It slides out of position where it wo n't activate the light . When you do get it aligned it does n't illuminate consistently . It flickers on and off making it annoying to use . It is compact but the annoyances are not worth the money . Spend you money on something more reliable like a keychain LED light .
 A product that does not work.I ordered two of these . Neither worked when they arrived.The company sent me two more as replacements . Neither of these worked either.You 're supposed to press the button to make the light come on . None of the 4 did . They were all from China . Must not have any quality assurance program .
 I bought three of these for friends and NONE work . The light worked for about 10 seconds on one . Then when we pressed the light button again -LRB- gently I might add -RRB- , it made a clicking noise and the light no longer worked . The other two were duds right out of the package . Excess packaging too ! -LRB- If the website would let me give this item NO STARS , I would have chosen that option -RRB-
 Too tacky -- not worth it . The led is too small to truely illuminate and it is not focused on the area being illuminated . I , too , thought I was going to recieve a pair of them but did not . The magnifier works fine , but you can get a thinner card to do that for less cost . I also bought the `` Fulcrum LED 2-Pack Card Magnifiers '' which is a little over 1/4 inch thick but works , is lightweight , and contained 2 of them , as advertised .
 I purchased the owl lite from ads I saw on TV . It is advertised as credit card sized , but that is misleading . It is in fact the shape of a creidt card , but it has the thickness of three credit cards stacked . That is too large for my wallet . It works as advertised so I may throw one in my gym or computer bag , but i ca n't put it in my wallet which is what I wanted .
 I have used DGL throughout the years with great success . DGL is a wonderful remedy for acid problems with the stomach . I purchased this brand of DGL thinking all DGL products are the same . So I did not read the ingredients . But Planetary Herbals puts orange flavoring into their formula of DGL . Which makes the taste absolutely horrible . I chewed one tablet and just about lost my cookies . I 've never tasted anything so awful . Licorice and orange flavors do not go well together . So this bottle of DGL went into the trash . Now I know to read the label of each brand of DGL .
 I dont get it . I read the reviews and and was really looking foward to trying this . I have alot of trouble with stress-related headaches and neck soreness from tension and I really wanted to love this . It was . . usless . I threw it away after the third attempt . The buckwheat does not heat evenly . The heat doesnt get held for more than a few minutes . The scent of lavender . . well ... it smells really off and I dont know why . I really was disapointed .
 The product is easy to use but when heated it smells like overheated oatmeal -LRB- it must be the buckwheat -RRB- . The smell is not too strong but it bothers me so I do not use it .
 I ordered this as a gift for someone , but decided not to give it to her because a fine gritty dust sifts out through the wrap -LRB- heated or not -RRB- . This dust gets on any surface you place the wrap on , including yourself . It was also kind of bunched up and too firm/almost crunchy especially in the part that curves in front of you . I have purchased other similar products -LRB- Bed Buddy -RRB- and was very satisfied -- just wanted to try something that would wrap around the neck more . I wonder if all of the Happy Company products are like this one ? -- ugh !
 It stays warm for maybe 10 minutes . I reheated it for maybe 3 minutes and now it stinks like a burning smell all the time . The Cherry stone neck pillow is much better , it stays hot longer and the heat is stronger as the weight of the wrap really helps the heat sink into sore neck muscles . Buy the cherry stone neck wrap instead . I use it everyday and its great .
 I have been using this product and not only have my stretch marks gotten worst , I now have a very itchy red rash all over my stomach . I started researching rashes during pregnancy and found that a lot of women are getting rashes after using palmer 's products . I will not be recommending their products to anyone .
 I used this stuff back in 2006 When a had a little trouble with a couple of cold sore outbreaks . The H Balm outbreak eliminator was absolutely useless . Made the sore sting , stinks to the high heavens -LRB- very odorous -RRB- and maybe helped healing by a day even when I used as directed . Hard to use this stuff in public or work because it has a very strong odor . After , I used the H Balm Daily which is oilier and supposed to prevent outbreaks and soothe lips . Nope got another outbreak about two months later , once again when used as directed . Winds up drying out your lips when used as directed , it has no emollients , offers no SPF protection , so your lips cook when in the the sun because it is oily . You will have to use a secondary protection and moisturizer stick . Wound up going to the dermatologist for the problem and she got me straightened out right quick . 2012 and no outbreaks since . Let me clue you if you are not sure about Herpes . It is a virus plain and simple . not a very nice one either . It replicates quickly . When it attacks the lips it is usually HSV-1 , when it attacks the genitals it it HSV-2 , but either one can attack the mouth or genitals depending on how you contract it , through , touching , drinking or eating after one who has an active sore , kissing or sexual contact , including oral sex . Up to 80 % of the American population have been exposed and are carriers , even if they are asymptomatic . Some get it and never pop a cold sore . Once you have either one it is your friend for life . There is no cure . When the virus runs its course it hides out in nerve endings , usually the trigeminal nerve ganglion if it 's the mouth sore . Many things reactivate it , stress , irritating foods , lowered immune , UV exposure . Over time outbreaks become less serious as the virus weakens . You develop antibodies to the strain you have . Topical agents are mostly to heal the sore , but you have to fight Herpes from the inside . This stuff says it does that , but dabbing this stuff on three or four times a day is not gon na get the job done , it may for some , but not for others . Valtrex worked miracles for me . Doc gave me a script . I do not have to take it everyday . Late 2006 when I felt the second one coming , I took two 1000mg Valtrex . No blisters , no sore , just mild pain for a couple of days . Beauty . If you want to use H Balm and H Balm daily go ahead . personally I think it 's a waste of time and money . It 's overly expensive and overhyped .
 When I first heard about the product , I was more than anxious to try it . Every review that I read was good , so I had to give it a try . I must be the only one in America that was not satisfied with this product . It actually did me more harm than good . The only good thing was the warming sensation which was very soothing . However , after that , it itched like crazy . It 's possible that I am allergic to it . I returned it .
 For those of you that may be looking to use this product for things other than cold sores , as I was , keep on looking . I used it religiously for two weeks , even though it smelled terrible and stung . I was careful to use it as directed . It did not speed up the recovery process . In fact , I healed a lot fasted after discontinuing use . The only thing I 've found that helps so far is antibiotic cream with topical pain relief .
 Yes , Sucker , is how I felt the first time I used this product . Waste of money , use Abreva , or get a prescription if you can .
 Wow ! What an excellent massage pad ... that lasted less than one month . I then bought a second one , because this is one plush , wonderful pad , with everything you could dream of a massage pad being . Definitely the best pad I have ever bought , and I have been using these pads everyday , usually for hours at a time for chronic pain , usually Homedics , and they always lasted for months . I never even returned them even though they were still under warranty because I used them so much , that it would n't be honest to do so . The second one of these I bought , one of the motors quit working after one day ! For this price - one month ? That 's just terribly awful !
 i put it in the microwave for 30 seconds and it blew up . there was gel goo everywhere .
 This `` boo boo '' soother has an adorable , machine washable terry cloth cover , but the small , round , soft plastic insert that you freeze is not effective . The insert is n't large enough to soothe most boo boos and the coolness dissipates long before the boo boo stops hurting . I would look for something larger .
 Once frozen , can not put it inside the sleeve.I tried to put it inside , when it was not frozen , the packing riped open and all the gel came out.Save your money ... It is not worth a penny
 This is the 4th pair of the Happy Toes that I 've owned , my family loves them and I was happy to find them instead of settling for a cheap substitute . However after the very first use , one of the outer seems became quickly unsewn , due to the location and material it is impossible to repair . I am very disappointed to say the least , the quality was unacceptable.I bought two pairs and the other was perfectly fine .
 These slipper were very bulky & cloddy -LRB- ? -RRB- and the smell from the lavender was not very pleasant at all .
 The slippers are comfortable and the filler is aromatic and warm . But the slippers were sewn so poorly that the filler began to fall out on both slippers . On the other hand , the item was cheap . I took the filler out and put it in place of another , more expensive pair .
 If you have small feet I guess they are OK . I have size 81/2 and no way can I get these on while wearing a pair of socks . Amazon should have explained that one size fits all means all under size 8 .
 The shoes are warm as advertised , but since they look like boots , one would expect you to be able to wear them around the house . You ca n't . They keep slipping .
 I bought a pair for my wife , heated them up and she wore them onnce in bed . She never put any pressure on them other than pulling them over her skinny size 9 feet to put them on . Never took a single step with them . When she removed them , one had a torn seam and was un-fixable . I put a little pressure on the other slipper in the same spot and it easily separated as well . Amazon 's return policy came through for me though . Thanks Amazon!So far , the Happy Company gloves and headband I bought seem fine though .
 I ordered these slippers as a gift . To my embarassment , the gift never arrived . I received an email stating that the slippers were backordered . Weeks later I received another email stating it would be an indefinite time before the product would be available . I just cancelled the order . I am defiitely an UN-Happy customer .
 THis bar is so disgusting !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ugh !!!!!!!! Keep your money and save your tastebuds and run !
 Definitely one of the worst flavors of protein bars I 've ever tasted . The other Atkins Advantage flavors are fine ... just do n't know what happened with this one . Giving it one star is being way too kind .
 The tip is rather big and is `` seperating '' so the pill falls out . It 's a bit big to fit into a cat 's mouth , in my opinion . We got another one and use this as a back up .
 The name and the instructions are very deceptive . It will only work if your knock your cat unconscious before trying to administer the pill . I 've got the scars on my arm to prove it .
 I bought the happy co electric head tripper for my husband for Christmas . He has wanted ones that we 've seen in the mall , so this seem to be a good one . Well , the plastic pieces that fit into the slot were very flemsy . We had to be careful not to snap it trying to get it in . Once we got it in , the head tripper felt great . It really did send goosebumps down my spine . THe only problem is the purple plastic piece broke off , litterally the next day after giving it to him . It first was bent and then finally broke all the way off . I do not recommend this product . I was thinking of getting the ting ting motorized head massager to replace them . You can still use the happy head tripper it is just one tong short .
 This product feels amazing . However , the base split in half the second time it was used . It 's still usable but it does n't feel the same nor does it work as well . :-LRB- I was very disappointed as this was a gift for someone very special
 Manufacturer would be better off providing extra legs , as this device is very fragile . Not a good consumer product .
 Item does not work properly . The turn nob on it does not turn it on . I have to beat on the end of it to get it to come on .
 might have been nice , but just went over my cheeks . No one at else at work wanted it , so I threw it out . too bad . The ones with metal wires are adjustable . Vibrating unit was just fine . Too bad !
 I bought this last November but did not open it until today . When I turned it on after inserting the battery , I assumed that the failure was attributable to a dead battery . I tried 2 new ones to no avail.BAD !
 never could turn on , plastic prongs promptly broke on 1st use.if it wasnt so inexpensive I would have packed and returned , instead ... STRAIGHT TO TRASH !!
 I bought this in order to release some stress . My job is very demanding and needed some helped so decided to by this product but never worked . At the beggining I through it was the battery so decided to try with a new one but nothing happened ... was very dissapointed ...
 The designer of this product seemed more interested in packaging , shipping and storage of this product that the use of it . The `` prongs '' are made of some sort of cheap plastic that enables the product to be packaged using less space because the prongs come disassembled . I had mine a week and the first prong broke - a week later another prong broke . I glued them but the break was in a place that would not hold . I would not recommend buying this product .
 Ok so I opted for this one since it had the vibration . Bad choice the plastic broke on the 1st use . Should have bought the cheaper non vibrating metal one . Hindesite is 20/20 .
 It should be noted in the description of this item that this product also doubles as a vibrator ! I 'm not talking about the muscle relaxing kind ; I 'm talking about the sexually stimulating kind . Once you remove the plastic prongs that are designed to relax the head/neck , the base is an approximately 5 inch vibrator . Just be forewarned , customers , this item is not for the easily offended .
 seeing how dr.pepper is like my most loved drink in the world i thought i would buy the lip `` gloss '' because i alwasy buy lip gloss . i hated it . it wasnt worth my dollar and cents . it just made my lips feel dry and left me with a bad sore throat . even though i hate the stick , i still LOVE the drink .
 I received two , not three trays . I ordered these to use with teeth whitening gel I just got and after I placed the order , the estimated delivery time was about a month from the date I ordered them . I soon realized that it was because they were coming from China . These are trays that you are supposed to boil , put in your mouth and suck on to make them fit . China is famous for making cheap knock-offs and have far less stringent safety regulations . I do not want to put these in my mouth . If I knew they were coming from China I would have never ordered them . I did n't expect this from an Amazon seller .
 These items just come LOOSE , stuffed into a Mailer-bubble envelope . There was absolutely `` NO '' packaging around the mouth pieces , not even a simple ziplock baggie - nada , nothing . That is not sterile at all . In addition , `` NO '' instructions were enclosed to tell me how to do it ! I 'm really disgusted . I 'm going to have to look on the internet to find out how to make them . The point is `` Who does something like that ?? '' ... Somebody very inconsiderate !!
 I ordered the Opalescence 35 % and 3 D.I.Y trays in a package all together and while the whitening gel was as described , the trays were a great disappointment . I was n't sure what to expect and from the other reviews I had read I figured that perhaps I should try it out on my own and not go by others opinion . The trays are very thick acrylic that does n't mold to your teeth as you would think they do , even by following step by step instructions . Very poor quality trays and not good for using with whitening gel . Playing football , perhaps . Ive decided to invest money in a professional dental trays instead .
 Ummm , as others have stated . Trays are to thick . I kept putting them in hot water until they were molded . They shrunk to small to fit the back teeth and really did not form fit my teeth to closely . Better than nothing , but there are better options . As they say , ` you get what you pay for ' !!
 These are just generic sport teeth guards , had I realized that to begin with I might have purchased them at a local store . They work okay ... . I do n't feel like my teeth have the right contact with the trays that they need to get the full effect of the bleech . You dip them in hot water then put them in your mouth and they shrink a little to fit your mouth , but not realy your teeth , just your mouth . If your going to spend the $ $ $ on bleech , its probably a good idea to spend the $ $ $ on better trays than these ones . -LRB- I ruined the first one , by putting it in boiling water for 6 seconds instead of 2-3 seconds like the directions said . So if you do get these take the directions seriousley . : -RRB-
 These do not work properly , they do not conform to your mouth . Do n't waste your money !
 The gaurds were really thick , which I thought was going to be a good thing . I followed instructions but before I could put them in my mouth to mold , they folded over on themselves . I got three in a package and do n't you know , all three got ruined when I tried to mold them . Oh well .
 This thermofitting teeth whitening tray system is no more than the typical heat-moulded athletic mouthguards you can find at any Wal-Mart or K-Mart store . If you have any experience with these mouthguards , you will find that they do not fit the teeth precisely , no matter how much care you take in moulding them . This is the crucial defect in this tray-system , as with any tooth whitening procedure , you need a carrier tray that is intimately moulded to your teeth . Without a good fitting tray , the bleaching material will leak out potentially causing chemical burns of the gums and other oral tissues.As a dentist I want to ensure that the tray the patient uses is a tight-fitting custom-moulded tray that will not leak.Buyer beware . You may get a good tray using this system and you may not . The stronger the bleaching material , the more the risk of leakage causing gum burning . Some people report this system works and others say it does not . Operator proficiency in moulding the trays to fit the teeth is likely the cause of success of failure . If the trays do not work for you , consider having your dentist make a custom-moulded tray . This will ensure that the bleaching gel will not leak out or get on the sensitive gum tissues . Yes , it will put a dent in your bank account , but it will not likely cause damage to your gum tissue.Buyer beware.konedog
 It took a while to receive this and when it came , I found out why !!!! It came from China . How do I know there is not harmful chemicals in there !!
 wouldnot order these again not impressed with the product at all . i will spend the money to get the ones from my detist so they actually fit with no fussing around
 I never received the product , and after letting the seller know that was told it was between me and the Post Office . Never again !!
 Ok this is a DIY so not perfect , but my goodness the tray is EXTREMELY bulky , makes your mouth look like a monkey mouth . It 's like wearing a football mouth guard ! So not cute , and not very functional either
 Shipped from China - did n't mention that in the `` detailed seller info '' . No instructions or any other material in the package . Thank you to you who have bought these as I will use your instructions . I will post with an update once they 've been through the molding process . So far the only possitive is the packaging was the most adequate size I 've ever seen ... abut 5 x 5 inches ! * Why is it I 've lived for almost 50 years and still have to be reminded that `` you get what you pay for '' * -LRB- rhetorical question -RRB-
 if I had known I was ordering directly from China I would have splurged for a more expensive item . a warning that it would take 2 months to arrive would be helpful .
 Where to begin ? I gave them two stars for being cheap , but they do n't mold properly and the instructions are wrong , if you boil for as long as stated they do n't mold , if too long they turn to gel , and collapse on themselves as a sticky mess .
 This product did n't really work for me . I followed the directions , but no matter how hot the matter was , the mold did ' t not even break it 's form .
 the DIY trays were too bulky and did n't allow the whiting gel to really cover over my teeth . would not recommend these trays for the NITE WHITE gels .
 Bad , bulky , mold only temporarily , then revert back to original and fall off , that is if they hold in the first place . Not worth even the 5 $ Do n't buy from California Dental .
 Not at all what they are supposed to be . The directions it comes with says you begin to form them before heating them , trim , and then boil . These are the typical ones you have to boil before you even begin to mold and are very noticable . Jaws is a liar .
 the trays do not fit at all in your mouth . there 's no instructions , came from China took a month to receive it.yes , they were cheap . now I know why . they are not moldable trays , that you would heat up and then press in your mouth to form.Would never recommend this product . not worth the expense to return them either .
 Unlike other buyers , the directions were wrote in just one paragraph . Boil water , put tray in for 3 seconds , put in mouth , suck out air , rinse with water and dry , Now I have 3 pieces of useless plastic and tubes of whitener I ca n't use ,
 This item was more like a football mouthpiece than the trays I have used in the past for whitening . They are heavy and triming is required . They were low cost but not a great product for whitening .
 Impossible to mold , but what do you expect for it being so cheap . First and last time . I will spend a little more and try another method .
 These trays are horrible and useless they dont conform to the teeth and melt quickly . Complete waste of money .
 I followed the directions to the T but they would NOT melt ! -LRB- it says to `` use hot water about the same as hot coffee '' . Nothing ! -RRB- So after 3 tries of increasing the hot water I finally BOILED water and dipped it in the hot water using a pair of pliers as not to burn myself.Then quickly tried to fit it to my teeth following the directions . A minute later . Not impressed . The plastic is just too thick.Luckily yesterday I found my PROFESSIONAL trays my dentist made that I had thought I 'd lost which are so thin and fit perfectly you barely know you are wearing them . Nope . I would NOT recommend the DIY trays . Sorry .
 Ordered these for a friend so they could use with the Day Whitening Kit and they 're pretty naff , would advise that you pay the extra and get a dentist to make a proper fitting set .
 Not worth it , even at the low price . I wasted my money
 Ive been using these attachments for years but this is the last one I 'm going to buy . They never last more than 2 months but they are very easy to find and very cheap that 's why I kept buying them . Thank goodness for the magnetic guards I found out about from another barber . They are expensive for guards but they work great and are very durable . So long speed o guides lol ...
 I order these thinking it would be what i needed for my addis master clipper do n't waste your money . . they will not last long at all . . One week they were sliding of my clipper blade . . Do n't fit the master at all . .
 I received 2 vanilla , 4 strawberry , 4 banana -LRB- All were LifeStyles -RRB- . Those were the ONLY flavored condoms sent.I also received :10 LifeStyles colored condoms10 regular Durex condomsand 10 Unil@tex regular condomsSo I received 40 total condoms ; but only 10 were flavored , they were all the same brand and there was only three different flavors . For someone who was ordering this to see if there were certain brands of flavored worth purchasing long term ... this was a hugely failed purchase .
 not total body purge for sure.bought 2 from one shiper and 2 from another possitively not product shown 4 bottels say so.doent look grape-e-power to me in the picture .
 This thing is such a joke . You put just a few things on it and it ca n't hold it 's own weight , it easily collapses and loses its form . Save your money .
 This thing annoys me so much . I came on Amazon to find a different brand . The velcro is incredibly weak . I can not fill the thing up with diapers b/c it ca n't handle the weight . It is very sloppy looking . It 's made of fabric and sags all over . This thing looks nothing like the picture . I do not recommend .
 I do n't even know where to start with this . My changing table has no top space so I purchased this thinking it was the ultimate solution . My first issue was attaching it , the velcro did n't seem to attach well around itself . I finally attached the little extra velcro pieces to the back of the organizer and was able to get it to stay - so I thought . I began to fill the organizer with diapers , and other light changing supplies and the changer kept sagging lower and lower . The `` shelves '' are a great idea but all of them slump forward . I walked into the other room and heard a light crashing noise . I came in to find the organizer on the floor and the velcro I put on the back had come off . I ended up using the little loop holes on the top and some cloth ribbon to tie it to my changing table . I will use this until I find a replacement but I would not buy this product again .
 Absolutely a waste of money . `` Sticky '' tabs do n't hold any weight and it fell off within 5 min of hanging it from the dresser .
 ok this product WOULD be wonderful IF it worked ... I was so excited to start using this product but once I got it all set up the whole thing sagged at the bottom allowing everything to fall to the floor ! I would suggest something a little more sturdy to do the job ! I am now looking into a cubby system from IKEA
 I like the idea of this organizer . HOWEVER , the shelves do NOT sit straight like in the photograph . There is a lot of space - it holds about 60 diapers . But the ` shelves ' droop forward once you put anything in them . I 'm not even talking about heavy stuff . I mean like bibs and pacifiers . Great photo , just did n't pan out in real life .
 The organizer sags severely when hung up , even before putting anything in it . It lacks rigidity . Look elsewhere for a change table organizer .
 I bought this diaper stacker b/c it looked attractive , the price was right , and it would be able to hold just about anything and everything I needed . When I put it together , the base for the wipes area was loose in the box and I had a very difficult time putting it in . Also , once it was hung , and still empty , it did not look anything like the picture . All the pockets -LRB- especially the wipes pocket -RRB- were sagging to the front . I loaded the diaper stacker area thinking that the weight might straighten it out , but it did not . I put in the wipes warmer on top and it sagged even more forward . It was very dangerous as I bumped it walking past it and everything else I had put in the pockets fell out ... including the wipes warmer . : - -LRB- I did n't buy it from Amazon.com , but do n't waste your money here or at any other store on this . No matter what I did , I could n't get it to sit upright and straight like the picture .
 The pockets sag really bad , I am not even sure I will be able to use it on the wall behind the changing table because I am scared the items I store will slide forward and fall on the baby . Not well built.I was very excited about this product but it was a total waste of money .
 Nothing can stand in the sagging pockets . I really wanted to have a few products standing in the pockets , but they were always laying down . Not very organized at all . It is simply not what the picture shows . My advice
 My mom and I just got done laughing until we almost peed our pants . This thing is pathetic . She even laughed and she 's the one that bought it for me . We have a wipe warner of the same brand loaded it up with diapers and stuff and it 's so sad just droops and everything is about to fall out . We thought maybe we were missing a piece or two but no . We were thinking maybe it was missing cardboard in the walls , nope , all there , just a sad sad little piece of crap organizer . For those that got this thing and actually like it I would LOVE to know what you did to make it work . Me and my mom and husband just laughed loaded it with diapers but I think a $ 4 clothes hamper would actually do a much better job .
 I put this on my registry , but after setting it up on our changing table , I realized it was not what I wanted . It 's much larger than I thought from the picture . It took up a lot of space , and I did n't have enough misc . items to fill it up . Everything was sagging . I tried to put wipes at the top , but they just slid to the front . We folded it up after a month and have n't tried to use it since .
 Unfortunately , this product does not work the way the picture implies . While this product is exactly what we were looking for , it does n't have a strong enough infrastructure . As soon as you put items on the shelves , it sags and things fall out . Definitely returning and getting something plastic that can actually hold things .
 I was searching for an organizer like this for WEEKS and found this and the Dexbaby one -LRB- apparently the only 2 made on earth ? -RRB- . This one STINKS and I ended up returning it - then bought the Dexbaby one which is terrific.The problen with this one if that it looks nice and rigid in the picture but you ca n't put anything in the compartments without it collapsing onto itself because the compartments need to be rigis but they are just canvas . I should have read the reviews first . Simply have no idea and would be so curious to know how a company could create something like this and sell it - if they simply made a prototype and tried to put a box of wipes in the top part they would immediately see it does n't hold it !? ... A discrace to still sell this on the market . Buy the Dexbaby one ! Same price - great looking - I got it 48 hours after I ordered it ! : -RRB-
 This not worth your money . It holds nothing . You can fill it up but it sags and the stuff just falls back out . It 's not sturdy . Do not buy . The bad part is I like Munchkin products but as you can see , not this .
 This product was a total waste of money it does not sit up , it leans over and does not hold anything because of the material i would advise everyone not to purchase this product .
 i have one issue with this product
 I purchased this diaper organizer to hang on my Delta Luv changing table , because there was no storage space on top . I had high hopes for it -- Munchkin products are usually high in quality . However , the cloth on this organizer sags . When I tried to fill it with my wipes box , baby powder , and lotion -- as shown in the picture -- the pockets tipped forward and everything fell out . I would n't want a toddler getting near this organizer ! A much safer option is the plastic `` Diaper Depot '' by Prince Lionheart .
 This product is a great idea in theory , and it was just what I needed . But the construction is very very poor . The shelves do n't stay horizontal once you start putting items . I put a pack of wipes in the top middle , a small purell on the top left and a Desitin on the top right , and the thing is already coming apart . VERY DISAPPOINTED !
 This organizer is not well made . The pockets sag and the velcro does not hold well . What other options are there ?
 I saw this at the store , and I just had to buy it . I loved all the little pockets for storing different things ; it would keep all my baby changing gear and other necessities all in one place . The picture on the cover shows it stocked full and hanging on the side of a dresser , which can be used as a changing table . What a marvelous concept ! So , I took it out of the package , attached it to the dresser and put all of my gear onto it . It looked very smart hanging there , and so practical ! When I came in the room the next day , it was on the floor in a crumpled lump . So , a little disheartened , but not wanting to give up , I hooked it up to my crib , instead . It was the next best thing and I really did like the device . I put all of my gear on there once more , the wipes on the top shelf just like the picture , but the top shelf is so flimsy that the wipes topple off of it . So , not only can I not hook it up to my changing table , I also ca n't keep all of the changing gear on it . This essentially makes this ill-made product completely worthless for the purpose it was designed .
 It only took 2 weeks for the velcro adhesive to fail and the entire organizer fell to the ground . I did not overload the organizer at all . Do not buy this if you need to attach with the dresser top option . I also agree with previous reviews regarding how the pockets sag .
 I bought this hoping it would help me organise all my baby diapering needs . Unless you have a changing station -LRB- or crib , wherever you want to hang it -RRB- that has slits or slots able to hold it - the velcro will NOT hold it well . And the `` shelves '' are a bit insecure . It 's a great idea , but just did n't pan out .
 I do n't know why any company would want to put their name on this product . It is so flimsy and saggy and if I could give it zero stars I would - this piece of junk was immediately returned to the store . I bought it to hang on the side of our pack n play since we use it a lot for diaper changes and I wanted more storage space for things like qtips , thermometer , cloth diaper supplies , etc. . It held diapers ok but if you put wipes on top as shown in the pic , the whole thing sags and the wipe container falls out easily . The side pockets also do not hold up . So you are better off just getting a diaper stacker since thats about all it is good for . I attached it to the pack n play with the adhesive velcro that was included in the box . The adhesive held up better than the velcro did ... it un-velcroed -LRB- for lack of better term -RRB- within 5 minutes of me hanging it up and putting stuff in it .
 I tried every which way to mount this organizer . I tried the loops , the velcro , and the straps . No matter what I tried , the organizer did n't keep its shape . The wipe container was normal size , but the whole thing sagged from the weight , and the shelves just kept slanting so stuff fell out . The only thing that stayed in were the diapers , but I was hoping to fit a little of everything in it . I finally gave up and got a dresser top organizer which was much easier for me .
 I saw this product at the store and thought it was an awesome solution for saving space . It was the last one on the shelf , and I walked out of there feeling so lucky to have bought it . I love finding ways to organize anything and so I could n't wait to get home and try it out . Munchkin , you disappoint me ! It 's a great concept , but awful in execution . The whole thing tips forward , the diapers do n't stack well , the fabric started to fray , and I had n't even used the thing yet . I thought mounting it to the wall would be a good solution for the tipping issue , but it did n't help , and it 's quite the eyesore . I am not exaggerating when I say this is the worst product I 've bought for my baby so far . In short , do n't waste your money or time on this product , it does n't even deserve one star .
 I purchased this organizer since it was the same one my sister used and I did n't know of any others . I liked how it looked in the picture , sitting up straight against the changing table holding all the diaper changing needs . However , that picture is very misleading . This organizer sags and leans forward to the point that if you even put half a package of diapers in it the diapers start falling out , if you push down too hard while closing the wipes container the velcro gives out and it falls to the floor ... if its that easy to make it come loose I imagine that it will fall the first time my daughter pulls on it . I eventually tied mine with ribbon to help hold it up but it still sags so bad that I 'm now shopping for something more sturdy . This was a total waste of money .
 Just as the title states ... with a package of diapers in the diaper stacker and a few baby washes , the velcro on this item comes apart and the item falls down . Useless , in my opinion , to organize anything .
 This is a horrible product and the picture should be pulled for false advertising . When you set it up the whole thing sags . The baby wipe containers will not stay in the top pocket 1 -RRB- because of the sagging and 2 -RRB- because the pocket is so huge . The pockets on the side of the diaper wipes are virtually useless because of the sag . If the bottom is more than half way filled with disposable diapers the organizer gets so heavy . If you dont have bars on your changing table you need to use the provided stick on velcro straps , but if the organizer gets too heavy it will pull on the glue and come off . In the end I found myself with a half full organizer resting on the ground -LRB- because the straps pulled off -RRB- , wipes on the changing table -LRB- because it wouldnt stay in the organizer -RRB- and a long line of sticky glue on my changing table because the organizer pulled off .
 I use it for lightweight items because everything else kept falling out and / or caused the velcro straps to come undone . This thing needs LOTS of improvement and I do n't understand why they have n't been made after all of the complaints . I found it at Target for $ 4 and it helps to keep baby 's nursery organized but it is temporary . There is NO WAY I would pay full price for this thing .
 Like most of the reviews , the shelves tilt and the products I keep on it keep sliding off . This product should be taken off the market or the makers should improve on the quality
 SAGS SO BADLY that it is mostly unusable . I rigged it with 10-12 safety pins but it still does not closely resemble the support shown in the photo
 I usually love Munchkin 's stuff so I purchase this diaper oraganizer , boy was I dissapointed ! Its flimsy and unstable . Its fallen off my wall at least five times so I 'm lucky I did n't place it close to my daughter 's crib .
 I bought this for my daughter who is suffering with malabsorption . She gains weight on this formula but due to loads of corn syrup solids -LRB- refined sugar -RRB- , her temperament was very poor and her eczema was also exacerbated on this formula . I find it shocking that so many infant formulas on the market contain such awful ingredients .
 My son has severe eczema and I tried many different formulas . I was told by a good friend that elecare was a really good product and should try it . My son 's eczema got WORSE . . I spent alot of money with no results . If your child has eczema this product may not work for you .
 Item was defective , would n't turn off , button broken . Vibration was very mild , not what you would expect for the cost.Find something better for the money .
 :-LRB- I have sensitive skin . This lotion has a irritating `` cold burning '' sensation . Yay menthol . I did n't get a close shave and i did n't want to shave with it because it felt like the razor was dragging across my irritated skin.I was going to return my shaver until I tried the HQ170.The HQ170 moisturizing shaving lotion is much more comfortable .
 ... and the alternative lotion -LRB- HQ170 -RRB- is far more soothing on the skin providing an excellent shave with no facial discomfort.The Norelco shaver came with two samples of each cartridge and I only used one of the Gel cartridges ... I really ca n't see a point in using it.I 've ordered boxes of the lotion !
 The razor I bought came with packets of this gel , as well as the lotion . Possibly due to the consistency , the gel gets used up more quickly . It is also not as comfortable to use as the lotion is.The key ingredient that makes the difference is menthol . The gel has menthol , so that 's why it can be irritating . I read a review of shaving basics online , and it says always avoid shaving with products containing menthol . The lotion , on the other hand , always helps get a better shave , and is quite soothing .
 I never recieved this product . There was no mail service due to hurricane Katrina.Please sent it now since I am back at my house.Sudhir Julka
 I used this product in the past before and it was good . I do n't know if the manufacturer changed the formula or what . This product now also dries out much more quickly then it did the last time I bought it.The seller I got this from was great 5 stars to him/her .
 I exclusively used this product for a fleshlight toy and it will deteriorate the fleshlight material over time by making it sticky . The Liquid Silk product does not live up to it 's claim of being water-based BECAUSE IT IS NOT !!! I wondered why my fleshlight was getting `` Sticky '' from time to time use so quickly and found out why
 dont bother wasting your money this crap is not lube its lotion , ingredents are the exact same as lotion it is not water soluble and to wash off you have to really scrub with soap and hot water and even after that my hands still felt greasy sure it feels good at first but i had to really work hard to get off , this is sold at other sites as a novilty item now i know why this crap is a joke
 I was so excited to give this a try . When I got it I excitedly opened it . 2 seconds later when I read the ingredients my excitement disappeared . Parabens are all up in it . I know I should have read the ingredients but I thought since it was a `` high '' end lube it would n't have junk in it . My vagina is super sensitive so this lube wo n't be coming near it but I opened it so I guess I will use it on my partner . I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because it I do like the texture . Still super disappointed.I recommend : Sliquid Organics Natural Gel 8.5 fl ozIt 's long lasting , vegan , organic , and paraben free . This stuff is amazing . I wish I had never tried anything new .
 Very runny and not as good as popular brands . Expensivefor the small amount in jar . will not order again .

 my nanny likes to use the mitt for washing my baby but we have other towels that are twice as thick , so we only use the towel if the other 2 we have are in the wash -LRB- rarely -RRB- .
 THIS PRODUCT IS NOT FOR THE HEALTH CONSCIOUS.Yes , it has 20 % your daily this , and 45 % your daily that . There 's no disputing that.But consider the following :1 . First two ingredients
 I have two of these units . One in the kids bathroom and one in my shower . Just this morning I was in my shower and I heard the noise of the other unit going off . I was home alone and everyone had been gone to work/school . Freaked me out for a second . By the time I got to the kids shower , half the bottle was sprayed all over the floor , wall , sink , etc. . I got a face full myself before I managed to close the shower curtain . The entire full bottle emptied . I had to remove the unit from the shower and remove the batteries to get it to shut off ! This is a 3 month old unit and I was on my 3rd refill.I will be removing the unit from my shower also . They are both going in the trash . I would not want one to go off as I was showering . And the sticky mess I had to clean up all over the kids bathroom was ridiculous.So , beware to those who have one , make sure your shower curtain/door is kept close , it can go off all by itself . And it will just keep going and going and not shut off.Must be the energizer bunny at work , trying to scare me half to dealth !!!!!
 This is a waste of money . We had bought this a while ago with the two refills . It does not cover your ENTIRE shower , it only hits the area where the cleaner streams to . The ONLY good thing about it is it smells nice.Have you seen the commercial ? It shows a bunch of people cleaning at about face height . That is exactly where this system cleans . They do n't show them cleaning near the floor and the cleaner does n't go down that far.Please do n't waste your money on this !
 Not only did this not clean my shower at all , but I am now going to have to spend more time cleaning it to remove the stains it left . I was better off with a squeegee !
 The inside gunks up causing it to beep but not spin . Must be a design flaw because the old style unit did not have this problem . They knew this and released it to the consumer anyway .
 I bought this unit thinking it would help keep the shower clean . I was not under the impression it would clean every part of my shower . After all showers come in many shapes and sizes . And , it never cleaned one half of my 4 by 4 shower . But , I helped it by cleaning the other part of the shower.HOWEVER ... Most problematic was the DESIGN FLAW in the battery compartment . The cleaner leaks or spatters into the closed battery compartment when it hits the nearest wall behind it.I recycled it today!Back to more manual cleaning ... BH
 Based on other reviews , perhaps some units work better than others , but for the first week , when mine worked , it smelled nice , and could have been doing its job -LRB- not like my shower was in bad shape -RRB- . However , the first trouble was it would do its 12 seconds of beeping and then not spray . I would have to monkey with it to get it to work properly on several mornings . Then it stopped working all together . I discovered the residue built up in the battery case , making the contacts full of goo . Cleaning that off , it would work for a while , then go back to the other problem of beeping but not spraying.Coupled with the rate at which it goes through solution , and the amount of maintenance I 've had to put into it , I 'm throwing mine out today . Going to use the refills I purchased for cleaning the normal way .
 I 'm not sure what it is , but there is some sort of design flaw in this thing . It really does seem to clean , but the automatic dispenser does n't last very long . It eats through batteries every week or so . I 've tried every combination possible
 Our problem has little to do with mildew but we have a significant issue with ` soap scum ' due to the effects of hard water combined with body oils and bar soap waxes and because our shower doors are transparent they show all residual matter . As a test , we tried using the liquid from the refill bottle just to see if it had the ability to work with manual application and it did n't appear to work any better than the rest of the many products we 've tried . Whether or not it does , however , the spray from the dispenser does not reach the back wall higher then 6 inches above the floor and the overlap where the 2 doors meet -LRB- 1/2 inch -RRB- prevents spray from reaching the second door . Even though the idea seems a good one , I can award only one star to this product because it apparently can not deliver the results that it promises .
 SUMMARY
 It sort of works a little on the area just above the tub , but just enough to make it look streaky . You still have to scrub your shower and tub . If it seems to good to be true -- it is . Mine is now hanging in the garage .
 The good : One button touch and you are done.It sprays the entire shower and keeps it clean.The not so good : Strong chemical smell.Can not be refilled with other less noxios product/requires purchase specific refills.Out first one stopped working after one month . The second one stopped working after two and a half months.Will not be buying a third one .
 I used this and bought 2 of them . The first one broke right out of the box . The other one was doing well until yesterday . It kept going off all day long every minute or so . I finally had to take the batteries out to shut it up . I called the manufacturer and they will send me a refund . I threw out the shower cleaner and kept the liquid refills . I figure I can still use them by squirting it onto a sponge or something . If I were you I would n't waste your money on buying this thing .
 The commercial makes you think that it will clean a dirty shower and keep a clean shower clean , neither of these are true . At the most it will slow the eventual build up of soap scum . It does n't work on my small shower so I can imagine that it will not work in a regular sized tub shower . I am a gadget person so I fell for it .
 This unit does what it is supposed to do for the most part when used as regularly as suggested . It nonetheless incurs costs above and beyond those you 'd normally expect , and it does n't cover as much of the shower/tub as I hoped it would . The unexpected costs are one of the primary reasons it scored so low.For one , the unit is power hungry , and goes through batteries like no other device I 've ever used . Expect one-and-a-half to two weeks , at most , from a set of brand new AA batteries . The instructions on the unit and the manual state not to use rechargeable batteries , but , being the experimental type , I tried them anyway . The unit played its 15 warning beeps and ... did n't work . It worked fine when regular batteries were re-installed . Not being able to use rechargeable batteries is disappointing.Another problem is the coverage area . It covers most of the shower in its spray , but misses the area about 1.5 feet above the tub/shower floor . This area will need to be cleaned as you normally would.Finally , the unit uses a lot of fluid , or it evaporates very quickly . We went through two and a half bottles of fluid in a given month , running it once a day for two weeks , then cutting back to every other day when we saw how much fluid was used . Since the bottles cost $ 4 each or more , that 's an unexpected cost that adds up quickly.With its excessive power requirements , inconsistent spray area , and fluid usage , I do n't think this unit is worth the money . The increased costs in battery consumption and fluid evaporation , as well as the coverage area , nullify any cleaning benefits provided . The only folks who benefit from this unit would be those who ca n't do the cleaning themselves due to injury or some other ailment . Otherwise , save the money and use elbow grease and a cleanser every other day or so .
 The product cleaned better than nothing and did decrease the amount of scrubbing I had to do -- WHEN THE DEVICE WORKED . I actually bought 3 devices because I thought I ruined the first two by allowing the battery compartment to get wet by not changing the batteries properly . However , with my LAST unit , I realized that the cleaning solution leaks into the battery compartment thus rendering it inoperable . Guess I was a little slow to realize that the device is of poor quality . Too bad .
 I 'm a big fan of automatic cleaning devices , but this one does not work . We used at least 4 bottles of solution and did not notice any difference . The solution does leave a clean smell after use , but that is the only positive I can say . Total waste of money .
 Does it work ? Yes . Can it be improved ? Big time . Shall you get this ? Please read.Firstly about its design flaws
 I 've used this for about 5 months now and I ca n't say I notice a difference . If I could do it over again , I would save the $ 20-something that I spent and just buy a spray bottle of clorox cleaner to keep in the shower and spray the areas that tend to get moldy in between cleanings .
 I have been using this device for about 6 months , and I really do n't think it 's doing anything . The spray does not really make it all the way to the back wall , and when it does , it is only about 3 feet off the floor.When you add up the expense of the refills , there is not really a benefit for the cost . Stick with regular cleaning supplies .
 The problem with our bathroom is mildew/mold , all blacken on the edge of the shower tub . I tried this automatic shower cleaner for more than a month , but there is no effect on removing the mildew . It cleans a little bit of stains on the wall , shower door and floor of the tub , but the effect is not obvious . And it ca n't reach the back shower wall ! Also , the smell of the chemical cleaner is really BAD , especially in my house which the bathroom has no window for air flow . I sometimes feel difficulty breathing smelling the chemical -LRB- I used to suffered from asthma -RRB- . The only advantage is that it 's very easy to use , just press the button everyday . But it is just too good to be true.Not recommend to buy this ... better try with Tilex and scrubbing !!
 When I saw this product I was delighted to think that this may lessen the endlessly repetitive and futile chore , so I scoured the tub until it was gleaming and tried it for a month . As previous posters have noted , the unit does not spray the tub - the exact area you need to prevent scum from building up . It is also very loud , but on the good side , the solution is not harsh smelling . So here we are 1 month later and I am again slaving away at the stubborn buildup . This product did absolutely nothing and was a complete waste of money .
 I had the same experience as CraigF with 2 different units . It did n't clean well at all , maybe it 's because we have a plastic tub surround . Does n't even touch the tub itself . Also both units failed after about 2-3 months , just quit spraying . The company itself replaced the first one , then the second did the same thing . Finally asked for and got my $ 25 back.Bob
 just replace your shaving heads once or twice a year and you continue to get a easy smooth shave . also remember the shaving gel/lotion .
 Be careful . 100 loose pcks in an envelope . Exp . 5/09 . What comes in the stores is already 2011 . Would not order again
 Expiration Date is a few months away . I purchased these to REFILL a few first aid kits . Looks like i 'll need to replace the Advil in a few months . Save your money , order from someone else . I should have known better when the description said ` not returnable ' . Shame on me .
 September 2013 , less than nine months from the date of purchase is outrageous expiration date for drugs sold at full price . These drugs are almost useless for the first aid kits I am restocking for 2013 trips . At best these almost outdated drugs should be labeled as such and sold at a deep discount .
 Ok , it 's now 8/12 and the product expires 9/13 . Guess that says it all . If this was fresh stock , it would have a shelf life of three or more years . Back it goes and I will not order from these guys again . Caveat emptor .
 The best smelling glade plug-in is tropical mist . Tracking down the aerosol was nearly impossible and took many years . Once you buy this tr + sh , you 'll know why.One . it smells nothing like the plug-in , though branded identically.Two . It has an overpowering chemical undertone , and barely any scent at all.The mixture was clearly discontinued by Glade after they realized they could n't get it right and that this can of stink held no appeal for anyone .
 I was hoping it was the same as Glade Fabric & air odor eliminator . it does n't smell the same way . .
 I bought this for my toddler to use on his pillow in case there were night time accidents . The material made a lot of noise which he did n't like . Also , it made him get really hot/sweaty . It does not zip closed , it overlaps but this does not work very well . The pillowcase ends up to be only MOSTLY waterproof . I bought a zip close terrycloth cover to replace it and I 'm very happy with that .
 I was looking for something more liquid and instead I got a gel . The product dries pretty quick when used with condoms , I can not say it will without them because I have not tried . It wasnt horrible but who wants to stop and `` lube up '' more then once if its not necessary .
 Oh man , this stuff just does n't work for personal lubrication . I get like 2 minutes into my personal lubrication and this turns into a sticky nasty mess . I mean , my guy gets to hurtin ' , my fingers and palm stick to him and he 's just not happy like that . Well maybe you like that , and this would be good glue for you , but for my big buddy - he does n't like stuff stickin ' to him.Aww its just thick gooey mess . I mean it might work OK for , well , two person lubrication . But even then , if it 's sahara desert already - dang you could get your big guy stuck up in there . It might never come out , well unless you come . But self lubrication , nope . Oh unless you 're really quick - then it works great . Me I like a long stroll in the park , check out the scenery , take my time .
 It looks like the photo - I really needed a cushion that was not full of poly foam - so it is what it is.I flat out do n't like it for the intent , but do plan to keep it for other purposes .
 The toy might have worked fine but since they did n't package everything separate and just through everything in a paddd pak , the liquid opened up and was all over the inside of the package and all of the toys had a nice healthy lube coating . Was not ver happy about this . They did agree to send out a replacement tube of lube but I had to clean everything up myself .
 I am glad this product is green , having 2 small children in the house , I feel much better on that ... but it does not do much on the floors and the tough , set-in messes my kids make . I have more luck with hot water and a mop . I would n't buy this again .
 I bought this product because I was told that you HAVE to use it to clean the type of floor I have , you can use nothing else . I did a part of the floor side by side with my old standby that I use for everything - Mr. Clean and honestly , there is no difference . Well , unless you consider the difference in price . I am just careful to not let the mop be too wet because supposedly too much water can damage the floor , or make the tiles come up . For my money , I 'll stick with what 's worked for years and costs a lot less .
 I was so looking forward to this due to the reviews as being the best ever used , well let me tell ya , it streaks on laminate just like the rest , not too happy with it
 This product cleans about as well as water . Of course it 's environmentally friendly , water is too . Does n't leave any residue because water does n't leave residue . I am dumping it down the drain . Ended up with an expensive spray bottle I can reuse .
 The product packaging and labels were very clear and directions were easy to follow . That is the end of any positive statements . This experience out -LRB- Beautiful day , calmest seas I have ever been on and feeling totally rested and well before leaving shore -RRB- turned into what I can only call a nightmare . Some how this product made me feel worse than I ever have . I realized it about half way through the trip that every time I put it on I would get sick in 10 to 15 minutes after application . I stopped the applications and managed to hold my stomach even though I still felt terrible . Honest to goodness , I would have been better off without it and feeling bad instead of horrible and non functional .

 Tried MotionEaze for a 1-hr bus trip . Applied it on my 9-yr old and mefollowing the intructions that came with it . It did not help.Gave MotionEaze another try on a 2-hr plane trip for my 9-yr old and me.We both still felt dizzy and had that tummy discomfort of feeling likethrowing up . Then finally , my 9-yr old did throw up . The plane tripwas a little turbulent , but that is exactly what I expected MotionEaze tohelp with.I bought Bonine for myself and it was absolutely helpful on our cruise.We also took a 45-minute ferry ride and you could really feel the boatmovements a lot . That normally triggered motion-sickness for me , but with Bonine , no problem whatsoever . One side-effect though is thatBonine initially made me a bit sleepy , but just a little bit and foronly a few minutes.Bottomline , if you can take Bonine , do it . If not , cross your fingersand try MotionEaze or a sea band . Maybe you 'll be one of the lucky fewwhich gets some benefit from it .
 Do not buy this product . It made me , and the 3 other people I was with , sick . We used it exactly as directed , and within half an hour we were all nauseous . We had to wash it off as quickly as possible to stop from being sick before we even set foot on the boat!I am not 100 % sure what made us sick . It may have been the extremely over power odor or the oil soaking into our systems and actually messing with our equilibrium . I believe it was probably a combination of both , because while I did feel better after washing it off , I did not feel very good the rest of the day . Needless to say , I threw it out that evening .
 It helps many people with motion sickness . It did not help me . Worth a try though.-Susan
 I bought this at a local health herbal store to try on my then 2 1/2 year old who has suffered from motion sickness since she was 15 months old . Her m/s has gotten progressively worse as she gotten older -LRB- she 's four now -RRB- and she ca n't even make a five minute to the closest store and back w/out gagging . She usually gets physically sick after about twenty mins . or more in the car . We tried this product to see if we could get her to a friend 's house about an hour away . She made it thirty mins . before she started vomiting . We had to turn around and come home b/c she could n't stop being sick , she even got sick while she was asleep . Her pediatrician says she has a severe problem that needs to be looked at by an ear , nose and throat specialist . I do n't know if this product just did n't help her b/c of the severity of her sickness or it just does n't work . But I need to rate it according to the fact that it did n't help my daughter . I have tried it a couple of times since then on shorter trips and she still ends up gagging , even if she does n't actually physically vomit . So I 'm thinking it does n't work for her and I wish it did , b/c she really ca n't go anywhere w/out being miserable .
 I suffer from motion sickness when sailing in ocean swells . Looking for an alternative to traditional seasick pills , which always make me very drowsy -LRB- even the `` non-drowsy '' type -RRB- , I decided to try Motion Eaze . My first time using it I got sick twice on a three hour sail , so it does n't seem to work for me . I will give it one more try , however , since the last time out I allowed myself to get hungry , which can enhance the feeling of motion sickness .
 So my husband and I were going on a cruise for the first time for our anniversary , and while we were really excited , my husband was a little nervous about getting motion sick . You have to understand my husband gets motion sick in a car , on a boat , on a treadmill , on a plane , on the Indiana Jones ride in Disneyland ! I ordered a bunch of stuff . He tried these drops once but the solution itself smells bad . Its like a weird herbal smell ... He put on the psi bands right away so we dont really know how effective the drops were . The Psi Bands , and Sea Bands worked better for him .
 I thought I would try Motion Eaze since it was all natural , and does n't interact with other meds . It took the edge off for me . I did n't actually have to throw up , though I felt as if I would . It was so-so for the general bus ride , UNTIL the bus started making sudden stops like in NYC traffic , and at the tolls . Then I 'm sure I turned green , started sweating , had to blow cold air on me . So it probably helps those that have a mild motion sickness problem . If I were you , I would bring along the Bonine/Dramamine just in case . Wish I had !
 This lube is only good for masturbation and vaginal , no anal -LRB- gay sex -RRB- . I believe all lubrication must be versatile in for all ocassional , it does have a great sensation ; however , the purpose that I potentially have for it , its not equipped for the job .
 I 've used similar products ... with a girlfriend or solo . . and they truly had `` warming '' effects . This did n't at all , and the formula they use does n't seem to affect gliding or reduce friction all that much . Try something else .
 I bought these trying to save on packaging -- usually they are sold as 40 count . The company sent me 40 packs instead . So this is false advertising .
 I had recently tried a package of Doctors brand brushpicks and was very happy with them so I thought I 'd give these a try . I was disappointed and somewhat annoyed . First , they come stuck together so you have to manually separate them and put them in the case . Of course I washed my hands first , but fondling all my toothpicks before storing them for later use is not my idea of a good idea . Second , the case is not big enough to store all 40 picks so I had to find some alternative storage for the remainder . Then later , I guess I 'll have to fondle the rest of them in order to reload the case . Contrast this with the Doctors brand which come already in a case with a flip top and a hole that can dispense a single pick at a time . Much more convenient and sanitary . I had enjoyed other GUM products in the past but I wo n't be getting these again unless they drastically change the packaging .
 This Black Hair product did not cover my wife 's Gray Hair at all ... It did , however turn her Gary Hair a nice bright coppery orange ...
 Please do n't waste your money . This product if horrible . This product says 2 bags , it actually means that they 're are two bags of product to use in one session . It takes alot of time to use this product . Over 4 hours . You apply the first bag of product and time it , then rinse it , and apply the other bag of henna , time it , and rinse . It claims to cover grey . It only tints it slightly . But you do n't read this until you get the product and its in the instructions . Nothing wrong with the seller or their service .
 I was excited to see that you could achieve a brown color with a henna product . Or so I thought . The information on the web site does n't contain important points that would enable you to make an informed decision to purchase this product . There is a very detailed color chart included with the product that is not provided on the web site . This would be the first step in making an informed decision to purchase . The color chart revealed that in fact , this product will not produce light brown results , but a variety of reddish tones.The web site also does n't explain the lengthy , cumbersome , messy and complicated process involved in actually using the product . Well at least I think it is all those things , because frankly I wo n't even be trying the product based upon the instructions . It was n't that expensive so it is not worth it to return it , but I hope that better information is provided in the future to avoid someone else having a disappointing purchase experience .
 I 'm satisfied with the slippery stuff gel but did not receive the adult sex toy kit so unable to give a positive review.J . Kunze
 Misleading advertising by showing 2 sprays in the picture , you only get one . I could have bought this cheaper in the store .
 I bought this product in hopes it would smell as amazing as the deotorant and be warned it smells nothing like it ! I threw it away after realizing how awful it smelled ...
 Simple review . The Old Spice Aqua Reef scented body spray does n't smell anything like the Aqua Reef deodorant nor the Aqua Reef body wash . Really odd since all of the other respective Red Zone scents offered by Old Spice match .
 that 's a lie , the picture show REDZONE , but when i brought it , it just same old spice . i will never bay from you again.keep the truth in your products .
 This gel disintegrates into a thin liquid rapidly so it may be suitable for quick tests only . Its impedance matching characteristics are not too ideal when compared to standard ultrasonic gels either .
 If you really want a sour lollipop , go with one that does n't use marketing tricks to sell their product at inflated prices . Preggie pops are essentially the exact same product as YummyEarth lollipops , which are organic and are made in sour flavors as well . The only difference is , they are sold as just lollipops -LRB- not a morning sickness cure -RRB- and thus are a fraction of the cost . In regards to effectiveness , these drops unfortunately did nothing for me . The only thing they did do was make my mouth so raw it bled , but I was still throwing up and sick all day . I would not recommend this product to anyone !
 I heard about this item from a friend . She personally hadnt tried it but some one she knew had . The Candy dosnt taste good and it didnt help relieve any morning sickness at all . The flavors were wierd . I couldnt even stand the smell . The sour flavors were too sour to stand . The thought behind this product has good intentions but it didnt work for me personally .
 I hate to feel nauseous . Hate it . So during my first pregnancy I was anxious to find anything that might work to help me lose the morning sickness . I tried Sea Bands -LRB- no effect , returned them -RRB- , saltines -LRB- ok -RRB- , ginger ale -LRB- also ok -RRB- , prescription meds -LRB- wonderful -RRB- and preggie pops . I thought they would be convenient as I could carry them around with me in a pocket or purse and not have cracker crumbs all over my growing tummy . Although the preggie pops are indeed portable , that 's about all they are . They did NOTHING for my morning sickness - they 're just a more expensive lollipop . Apparently they 're supposed to help with dry mouth , but ANY candy sucker or mint will perform the same function for a much lower price . Although some people have said these pops have been helpful for them , I can say without a doubt that I would not buy them again .
 This product is a great concept but unfortunately did n't work for me . Every pregnant woman is different with her intolerances and triggers for nausea so while this product did nothing for me , it may help someone else . In fact the flavors made me more queasy . I will stick to my lemon drops and peppermints .
 I was told by two friends that these would ease my nausea . The ` special blend ' of herbs really is a gimmick in my opinion . they do n't tell you what 's in them and i truly feel they are just glorified hard candy . They did n't work for me and as I was sitting in my hair appt . sucking on a lollipop it all seemed a little juvenile . I did buy the preggie pop drops which eliminates the need for the lollipop so it 's a little more discreet . If I had it all to do over i would just buy some organic , naturally sweetened hard candies and call it a day . I ended up having a special tincture mixed for me by my local herbalist called ` pregnancy nausea relief ' and it worked like a charm . Unlike the preggie pops , I do know what is in my tincture .
 These did n't really do much for me . The only ones I could stand were the lemon . . and even then they did n't help . Try getting regular hard candies instead ... they will cost a lot less .
 They taste good but do n't really help so much with the sickness ... sprite works better at settling a queezy stomach . They may help someone with very very mild sickness ... but prolly not .
 I wear this type of splint to bed at night due to my carpal tunnel , my old splints bought at a medical supply store were getting pretty yucky after 3 years of use , so I figured I 'd replace them . Picture wise these looked identical to the ones I had . They are much lower quality.First , the metal splint is inserted into a slot that has no way of securing it at hte bottom , so it slips out . The velcro straps wrap around and adhere to the hook strip , but the strip is sewn all the way to the bottom edge and the hooks irritate my skin there as they poke through the edging . I applied medical tape over that section just to make the splint wearable . Lastly , the stretchy fabric inside the splint is rather tight , making the splint feel tight even if the straps are n't taught , however that part I 've gotten fairly used to.After using these about a month , I 'm going to have to go back to my old ones because they have worn a sore spot on my forearm from the hook and loop and I 'll probably go to a medical supply store to buy my next pair .
 I ordered the Neutrogena Foot Cream in the white box - a white tube with blue and red writing , but received the Foot Cream with a white and red box with white and red tube . Since this is not what I ordered , I will probably be returning it . For one thing , what I received smells pretty strong and I 'm not sure I can handle the smell of it . The Foot Cream in the all white tube does not have a strong odor like this . Not very happy that what was pictured is not what was shipped . False advertising ??
 I ordered 2 products almost the same but not the same.One foot cream and the other heel cream .2 foot creams came They came in 2 different packages with 2 different shipping charges . When I notified amazon of this error , I recieved no response . I got the same order twice . One Order should have been a foot cream and the other a heel cream . No response and still no heel cream.Asking me for a review is just another insult to me . Amozon you must be too busy to take care of your compalaints but you are to busy to ask for a review.Thanks
 I purchased this foot cream a few months ago in a red tube and package . I have to buy it online because I ca n't find it in stores , so I ordered it again . While the website still had the red package picture , it had a notice saying that packaging had recently changed . That turned out to be true , it 's now a white and blue box and tube.Unfortunately , they also watered down the lotion when they changed packaging . The previous packaging read the lotion `` delivers a full day 's moisturization '' . The new package reads `` over 17 hours of moisturization '' , but otherwise reads the same . I compared my old lotion with the new and the difference is readily apparent . After a few days of using the new lotion , I find that I can no longer get away with just 1 use per day , I have to use it at least twice , sometimes 3 times . It also does n't penetrate as well , so it 's not as good for the really rough , dry spots I experience on one foot . The previous tube kept me from getting cracks in this one trouble spot , but I noticed tonight I 'm getting a crack in the foot despite using the new Neutrogena.This was so disappointing for me . I searched for years to find a good foot lotion and the old Neutrogena was it . This new stuff is only marginally better than the kinds you can find at any drugstore , and at $ 5 or more for 2 ounces plus having to use it more times per day , it 's just not worth it anymore . Hope it was worth it to Neutrogena .
 I received my sabona lady executive dress gold duet magnetic bracelet and was so excited . It is really a very pretty bracelet . I put it on immediately and within ten minutes , it fell off my wrist . It is a good thing I was still in my home because I would have lost it had I been outside.When I examined it closely , one of the pins that hold the links together was missing . I had to call the company and they advised me to mail it to them and they would replace it . I had to wrap it up , go to the post office and pay for priority mailing to send it back to them . It took over two weeks for me to get the bracelet back . They told me it should take only one week . I think this company should have reimbursed me my mailing cost because the bracelet was apparantly defective and cost me $ 3.85 to mail it back to them . And what about my disappointment and the inconvenience of going to the post office . I now have it for two days and so far it has not broken . I have to say though , I feel like I am constantly checking to make sure it is on my wrist . Hopefully , it wo n't break again .
 I loved this bracelet but found that clasp came undone easily . If fell off my wrist from time to time and finally was lost last week . I wo n't buy this style again .
 Really not at all worth the price I paid.It 's pretty `` cheezy '' looking , and it has a real cheap , and VERY hard to open & close , clasp.Also , I have n't seen -LRB- felt -RRB- any positive results from the whole magnetic bracelet hoopla .
 This brace is very hard to use and you have to wear tennis shoes with it or you walk right out of the brace . it does n't fit well and is not comfortable nor does it provider good ankle support . It is a waste of money

 I have been expecting my product for some time , but have not received it as yet . The payment for it has been taken from my account but I have not received the product .

 I ordered the canister of strawberry-banana after trying it in a sample pack -LRB- the sample was very good , strong distinct strawberry and banana flavors -RRB- but what came was very bland , almost no flavor at all . very disappointing .

 I just received the item in the mail today . I knew it was plastic , but the quality was really below my expectation . The edges around the openings are rough , and the smell of the plastic was really bad -LRB- and I am supposed to stick it up my nose ! -RRB- . I was really disappointed , but it 's a lesson learned that you get what you pay for . I would return it but it is so not worth the time and paying for the return shipping just to get $ 6.00 back .
 The Lin review from 2007 pretty much nailed the description of this product , except that mine did not have a strong smell . If they are from the same manufacturing run , 5 years is plenty of time for plasticizers to outgas , which would explain the lack of odor with mine.The casting is thin-walled low density polyethylene . I can see some small scrape marks where they tried to remove roughness . But the casting is bad , and there is really no way to salvage the product . If the maker had upgraded the product during production , for example doubling the wall thickness , this could have been a better product.I 'm going to try loading some closeup photos of the product . If they get posted , you will see what I mean .
 Buy at your own risk , i am sure it has helped someone along the way but not anyone i know .
 I do not like Xylitol ! I have tried Stevia without any issues , but decided to try Xylitol when my Stevia ran out as I 'd heard good things about it . I have gluten sensitivities and this product , although it says it is gluten-free , made me feel all of my symptoms -LRB- nauseous , tummyache , diarrhea , gassy , etc. -RRB- This product is just not good for me .
 I recently purchased Jarrow 's xylitol because I was out of my usual brand and the only place I could find any xylitol was in Whole Foods . Apparently Whole Foods only stocks Jarrow . Anyhow , I recently purchased Jarrow 's xylitol and , to quote Julia Roberts to the nasty saleslady in Pretty Woman , `` Big mistake . Huge . `` This product has the fine , powdery consistency of baking soda and seems just as inclined towards clumping , even with the addition of a chemical anti-clumping agent . I 'm not sure whether it 's this fineness or this chemical additive -LRB- silicon dioxide -RRB- , but when I put a little spoonful into my mouth , instead of dissolving evenly into a sweet , clear liquid , it turned into a thick glop . It also has a weird aftertaste that I 've never noticed in other xylitol brands . Those of you raving about this stuff ought to sample a few other brands first .
 I wo n't pan it completely , just share my experience with others who may have the same . I took 20mg/day for two months . I noted absolutely no effect other than a slight wooziness for a few minutes after ingesting , which passed after the first 3 weeks . I tried it for age related short term memory loss . I wish that I had the positive experience reported by other reviewers . I really wanted it to work !
 I understand that this product might affect older folks differently from younger ones -LRB- I 'm 30 years old -RRB- , but I guess given I 'm already in very good health perhaps it was doomed to not change how I feel . I tried this product for a full week at 20 mg per day and felt nothing whatsoever . Not even placebo effect ! For $ 5 , it 's still worth a shot if you 're sedentary and are looking to give your brain a boost .
 I 've been taking 3 tablets a day for a couple of months now and I ca n't tell any difference between now and when I first started taking them . Once I run out , I wo n't be buying anymore . While there might be some advantage to taking these , I 'm either not aware of the changes or my body is metabolizing these out of my system before they can take effect .
 As with any supplement , it is better to check with a doctor first , I took this because there were some theories that it might help with tinnitus , but after using it for over a year I have noticed no difference . In fact I started developing a slight nagging headache that went away when I stopped.It definitely needs to be taken with food and you should know that this is a prescription drug in Europe . It is purported to be an aid for memory improvement and an anti inflammatory drug.Because of these properties you should also be aware that anyone with blood pressure problems or who is taking blood thinners should not take this.So for some this might work well - just did not for me
 I was really excited to try Vinpocetine , as I heard it was good for increasing focus and clarity . It does work , and it 's very noticeable , but the side effects are too much.When I tried it , it took quite a while to kick in , maybe 30-45 minutes or so . I took 20mg a day -LRB- Two 10mg pills spaced apart by about an hour -RRB- Once it started to work , it was quite noticeable . I noticed that I was able to focus significantly better , but only on less complex tasks . In fact , I feel as if more complex tasks become a bit harder with it . It does get rid of the brain fog quite effectively , overall . However , after a while I started noticing some bad , bad , bad side effects . I became very depressed for no particular/tangible reason over the next few days , and after waking up after my first day on it , I was in a rage that lasted a couple hours that made me cause trouble . Normally , I have very good self control and have a stable mood , so I 'd think the vinpocetine was to blame for all that , especially given that depression can be a side effect.So yeah , it works great as a nootropic , but the VERY noticeable depression and anger that came with it was just too much . Perhaps someday I 'll try it again at a lower dose -LRB- 5mg -RRB- and use it with another noot that does n't destroy dopamine like this does . Perhaps the combination would would wonders , but who knows ?
 From wikipedia on vinpocetine : Vinpocetine increases in neuronal levels of DOPAC , a metabolic breakdown product of dopamine , have been shown to occur in striatal isolated nerve endings as a result of exposure to vinpocetine . -LSB- 15 -RSB- Such an effect is consistent with the biogenic pharmacology of reserpine , a structural relative of vinpocetine , which depletes catecholamine levels and causes depression as a side effect of the cardiovascular and anti-psychotic effects . -LSB- 15 -RSB- However , this effect tends to be reversible upon cessation of Vinpocetine administration , with full remission typically occurring within 3-4 weeks.Basically , it can lower dopamine , serotonin and norepinepherine all of which are essential neurotransmitters involved in mood and cognition .
 This product gave me a headache and made me feel disoriented , almost like I was drunk . It took about 3 days to feel normal again and ` with it ' . What a waste of money , I do n't recommend it .
 Purchased this product on the recommendation of a friend . It was only afterwards I spoke with a doctor who stated that vinpocetine has anti-inflammatory properties , but that he saw no medical reason for it to work as a nootropic -LRB- ie , smart drug/supplement -RRB- . Worse , there was even the possibility of it decreasing dopamine levels , worsening one 's concentration . Wish I had consulted the doctor first.However , I am a firm believer in placebos . So if it works for you -LRB- for whatever reason -RRB- , then continue using this product however you like and ignore my review .
 I am not sure this product has helped me or not ... I keep forgetting to take it ! You think if I could remember to take it then it might help ? I have tried to take the max of 3 a day but so far can not remember to take but 2 a day at most .
 After taking this supplement for three weeks I 've noticed that I am always sad and depressed . It did n't help with focus or memory . I 'll stop taking this supplement and see if my depression improves.Source Naturals Vinpocetine 10mg , 120 Tablets -LRB- Pack of 2 -RRB-
 I began taking vinpocetine since my mother had vascular dementia . I took it for three weeks and in those 3 weeks I was hit with a severe and pervasive sense of sadness . I 'm typically a joyful person but could n't shake this depression and intense sense of sadness . I did additional research into vinpocetine and saw the link between depression and vinpocetine . I stopped taking the vinpocetine and now a week later , my sense of emotional well-being and joy has returned . Beware all of you that , like me take supplements to better their health and lifestyles . Do your research because supplements behave differently in different people . To your health !
 These just are n't designed very well at all . The size , weight , and length are just off for me and I doubt I am alone . It was a chore to use especially because of the temperature - cold . There are better tools on the market .
 I bought this hoping it will work . But the small end it hard to control . It keep dropping off . I will not suggest to buy it .
 I have read the review before I purchase this product . But very disappointed . It is not as easy as the intruction indicated . I have tried on the smaller end , it dropped easily , The bigger end was too big and very discomfort . I would not recommend it .
 Got it tried it , then bought the vibrating one from jopen this one is weird and sticks out way too far so you 're stuck in the bathroom while you do your exercise . BORING !
 when I tried to use it I kept getting a yeast and it was n't wrapped securely to be a new item , but who would think anyone would sell something that personal that may have been used .
 Very poor instructions , and then when I tried to find more information on the internet I found conflicting information . The instructions say to start with the small end , but on a transcript from `` Oprah '' it says to start with the big end . Not very practical either , you 're supposed to do Kegels many times a day and you ca n't exactly use this when you 're sitting at a stoplight or at your desk . Not worth buying .
 I bought this to help strengthen pelvic floor muscles after baby # 1 ... something that seemed to just not be happening on it 's own . But I used it like 3 times , found it to be uncomfortable and a bit heavy for my purposes , and have n't used it since . : -LRB-
 Very little directions of how to use it . I got most information from the reviews on Amazon . Difficult and akward to use . I would not recommend it . I put it in the trash can .
 I was strictly pumping for my little one , so it was important to keep my supply up . I used fenugreek and mother 's milk tea . I 'm not sure it really worked . I thought maybe it was increasing my supply , but I think it might have been in my head . I do know that it made me smell like maple syrup big time . I also have suspicion that it was making my baby fussy , which I have read can be a side effect in other reviews . I think it might have upset his stomach because when we switched him to formula , he was much better , and that should n't be the case with breast milk . I know it was n't what I was eating because I was quite careful to eat mild foods . So , I do n't think I would recommend this product .
 Unfortunately , this product did n't help my milk supply . I also believe it made my baby more gassy . I did continue to use the product until it was gone . I am disappointed , but it does n't work for everyone .
 I started taking fenugreek several months ago because of supply issues and noticed an immediate difference . However , several weeks ago , my supply started decreasing again . I had been taking three pills , three times a day . I started taking four pills at time , then five . Still no increase . While discussing it with a friend , I realized that the decrease started about the time that I changed brands . I went back to my old brand , and my supply immediately increased again . I 'm not sure if the bottle I had was just old -LRB- the expiration date is 2014 , so I do n't think it is -RRB- or if this was just a bad batch or what . All I know is I wo n't be buying this brand again .
 Everyone 's body is different . It did n't work for me . In addition , there is no series of reputable research data to show any use of this product for growth harmone production -LRB- which I purchased it for -RRB- . I believe all people that rate this product as successful is the placebo affect -LRB- which a high count of people get using most products -RRB- . They want it to work so they think it does , etc. .
 I took the fenugreek pills according to the directions and did not notice any noticeable increase in my milk supply . I had much more luck with Motherlove More Milk Special Blend which was recommended by a woman in my Mommy & Me class -LRB- she said make sure it 's the `` special blend '' pills which you can also find on Amazon -RRB- .
 The stuff gave me a gut ache and the vendor would not let me return the item . Do n't purchase anything from them unless you know what you are getting .
 I bought the item from VitaminLife because it said `` In Stock '' . They sent an email that said differently . Basically , that the product was NOT in stock and may not be available from the supplier . I immediately cancelled my order . They say my card has n't been charged . My advice , buy from a different company - one where the company can be relied upon to have what they claim . By the way , when I went back to Amazon to see about writing this , I see that the company is STILL claiming it 's in stock . Buy elsewhere .
 The size of this product -- for an adult male -- is about one third of what it should be . I 'd received the same product from my physical therapist some years ago
 I 'm a 57yo female with medium size hands . I love having all the different colors and strength . I 've recently started martial arts and firearm safety classes . My firearm instuction mentioned I need to strengthen my trigger finger . This is an excellent way to do that . Smooth transaction . Glad I purchased .
 I was prescribed some therapy putty for my RSD after significantly improving my hand strength and motor skills in physical therapy . My insurance sent me the Cando Theraputty Hand Exercise Putty , 4oz , Green , from amazon and I was shocked when I opened the package to find a decent sized plastic container with only a tiny bit of putty.The putty itself weighs 2oz , with the container close to 3oz -- still NOT EVEN CLOSE TO 4oz stated in the product description.Therapy putty is great for restoring function to your hands , but buy from a different manufacturer that wo n't cheat you .
 You need magnesium to be able to absorb any form of calcium . This powder takes care of that issue . However , if high doses of magnesium give you diarrhea like they do me , it is possible that this product by itself would not be right for you.Calcium citrate is supposed to be more easily absorbed by the body than the calcium carbonate found in the majority of over the counter calcium supplements . What is so nice about the pure powder is that it is `` one less pill '' -LRB- or 3 or 4 less -RRB- to swallow . It mixes easily into juice , tea , soup , cereal and other wet/moist foods and drinks . It does NOT mix easily into a thick milkshake type smoothie . It turns clear liquids cloudy and settles out if you let it sit for some time.The trick is to remember to measure it out and mix it in !!! Keep in mind that you wo n't absorb any form of calcium if you do n't have the proper combination of magnesium , zinc , Vitamins A and D3 . The ideal thing is to get all of your nutritional needs from whole food , not from supplements . Sometimes this is not possible for various reasons , and it is good to know what is in everything you `` take '' including the foods you eat.It is a good idea to get professional assistance in the form of testing to find out what supplements you really need . And , if you are taking one supplement you need to do a bit of research to make sure you are getting the proper balance of other things that are needed for your body to use that supplement so you are not throwing your money out the window.I believe this calcium magnesium citrate is sourced from corn , although I have not contacted the NOW company to specifically ask that question . In any case , it gives me diarrhea - as does anything else made from corn . It does n't bother my husband . You need to know your own body and what you can and ca n't tolerate.As one other reviewer pointed out
 Ask yourself ... Why Parisi 's reviews are always the first and the oldest review on hundreds of supplements , few years ahead of any other review written by anyone else and that is the same situation not for one review but for hundreds of review and all those reviews with high scores for the seller and the product itself.READ THE COMMENT BY GREAT COOK IN PARISI 'S REVIEW ... Astonishing ... Parisi 's review is dated 2005 and the next review is dated 2007 . I guess no one ever purchased any of these supplements for few years in between or if they did , they had no opinion at all . Parisi even claims that he/she has been consuming all those supplements for years before writing the review . Majority of Parisi 's reviews are set like that and even though in many of his/her reviews Parisi is reminded that his/her review is misleading in Perisis 's comment section by other individuals , Parisi fails to respond or update his/her comments for some seven years . Meantime Parisi claims in many of his/her comments -LSB- I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY -RSB- ... No one can afford to swallow down that many supplements a day . No honest individual would let his/her review go so many years without updating such review if they are reminded by others that is misleading time after time .
 This product is being promoted as one capsule having 1 g of calcium and 500 mg of magnesium . In actual fact I believe you need to take THREE capsules to get that dosage . The ad should say `` one serving '' has 1 g / 500 mg . -LRB- Oh , the product itself is excellent ! -RRB-
 I tried this once and could n't handle the taste . Maybe a strong-tasting juice would have helped , but I mixed it with water . Ended up tossing it .
 I ordered one bottle with 240 caps . And the label said 80 % Mag . Oxide , 10 % Citrate , 10 % Malate . Magnesium Oxide has low digestibility . Magnesium Citrate would be the better choice .
 First , a big thank you to Amazon for providing this forum . I am grateful for this.Bought this without looking to make sure it was gmo free . Bought NOW gmo-free lecithin -- EXCELLENT product . -LRB- had to request that the Co-op store order gmo-free lecithin -RRB- Bought NOW gmo-free xylitol and have just re-ordered . Great product . Not only is this powder not gmo-free , it seems to be `` hiding gmo content '' because it is a calcium-mg . supp . It has a surprise -- soy-derivative on the label . The supp . is not listed in NOW 'S `` COMPLETE LIST OF GMO-FREE PRODUCTS '' on NOW 's website . It has this dorky rating from some rating organization , which they proudly display . Its a `` GMP '' seal -LRB- not finding a gmo free indication saying otherwise , I thought it was for `` genetically modified product '' at first when it got here -RRB- . I forgot to include this product with my other order I made the same evening , paying by mistake for standard shipping . This product is going back in the mail , still sealed . The soy or its possible infusion with herbicide may be why some are having problems with loose stools . The rest of the formula for this powder is `` to die for '' , I think . I 'm a 66 old lady -LRB- ha ha -RRB- , still trying to exercise regularly , and have felt that mg . in the past has helped leg pain after . Now I need calcium also to combat a tired back , and hoped to get everything I need in a powder . Think again . Already have large capsules -LRB- triple OOO 's -RRB- if it wo n't dissolve . Really thought that it would NOT be gmo , like so many other of their great products . Would n't be so grumpy -- if we were not trying to volunteer to get the labeling initiative passed here in the golden state so gave it 2 for trying , and because it was bargain priced , instead of 1 star -- LOL -LRB- No bargain -RRB-
 I like NOW Vitamins , unfortunately the description did not mention that it has Vitamin D in it . I have to take prescription D so ca n't take this .
 This product appeared to be exactly what I was looking for . They Both were made in the citrate form . Unfortunately , I am unable to absorb properly for my system . Although the instructions say to take 2 level teaspoons per serving , I tried 1 teaspoon and soon after , had cramps and had to run to the bathroom . I tried this more than once and the same thing happened . I also do not like the way it does not dissolve in liquids easily . It is gritty and if left in the glass for a few seconds , falls to the bottom.Anyway , thought this would be a good product for me , but is not . I guess I may have to get a softgel or capsule type .
 For several thousand years it has been known that the breath can be used to calm the mind and nervous system . Dr. Erik Peper the internationally famous biofeedback expert says : `` There are NO absolute respiration values ; range varies with the individual . Respiration is a continually changing homeostatic system . Pathology may be induced by forcing the system to match normative standards such as breathing at a fixed pace or volume . The breathing rhythm needs to be dynamically adapted and varied for each personEmwave and StressEraser do not allow for that breath variation and can cause increased tension instead of less . As far as the HearthMath Cut Through technique that is a Red Herring to create a marketing hook . Remember the KISS principle - keep it simple - diaphragm and reduced breathing is free - simple to learn - totally portable and is the core of HRV training.When you are watching a screen performance anxiety is a high possibility - also once you learn to meditate you can access the quiet stillness where the bodies wisdom resides . Technology blocks this important benefit .
 It seemed like it was a deal to buy this product from Amazon as opposed to the manufacturer becasue Amazon claims they include the optional finger sensor , which alone could cost another $ 20 . However , my package did NOT include the finger pulse sensor as was advertised . When I contacted customer service , they said they were too busy to send me the finger pulse sensor , and instead suggested that I take more of my time to package and return the item for an exchange or for my money back minus a 20 % restocking fee . I attached what they sent me below.Amazon 's customer service should be ashamed of their response . I may have to cancel scheduled sessions with clients depending on how long Amazon takes to send me my new package . Amazon 's customer service responded to me `` As I 'm sure you can understand , our Fulfillment Centers are vast , and we process thousands of orders each day . '' No Amazon , I do n't understand ??? You are busy because customers like me are giving you business , and when you screw up , you put the responsability on customers like me to fix it?At this point Amazon , the only way I can think to fix this problem is by not burdening you with anymore of my business that apparently keeps you from properly fulfilling orders and fixing your mistakes . Next time I 'll spend the extra $ 20 and buy the product directly from the manufacturer as someone who values reliability and being valued as a customer at a time when every dollar counts.Amazon 's Response to me : Hello , I am sorry to hear about the problem you experienced with your shipment . It is certainly not our intention to ship defective products to our customers.We always appreciate customer input on how we can improve our store , and I 've forwarded your message to our shipping department.I 'm not able to replace individual `` finger pulse sensor '' from a set , but I 'll replace the set for you . Once you 've received it , please ship back the original set . As I 'm sure you can understand , our Fulfillment Centers are vast , and we process thousands of orders each day . In addition to this , most of our processes are automated which makes it impossible for us to take away individual pieces from a set .
 This product should be great and is when it works , which is about 15 % of the time , it is really great . I bought this six months ago , in the Mac version . The principle is medically sound , you can ignore the new age theories and mysticism in which the manufacturers indulge . Unfortunately the software crashes the Mac far more often than it works . I have two set ups , on two different Macs , with two different sensors . -LRB- I 've also bought two pockets versions of the product , which are useless to me because you can not set the breathing rate , which you can on the Mac desktop version -RRB- . I do not mind software crashing normally , within the protected sandbox , as Apple calls it ; normally when piece of software crashes it does not take down the whole Mac with it . Emwave does , the whole Mac freezes , you can not use the mouse anymore , and even waiting five minutes it remains frozen , and so you have to do a hard reboot . This is risky and if you do that many times it may cause your whole Mac to malfunction permanently until you go through the hassle of reinstalling the operating system . It has required hard reboots many times . And as I say , I have two copies of the software , two different machines , and two different sensors , so this seems to be a systematic problem with the Emwave software , not a problem with my setup . I note that other reviewers also report the problem of crashing . I need this product to improve my stress response and health generally , which I have seen it do when it works . For me this product is a very nice to have , and not having it is n't a life threatening problem , although the long term effects of stress are life threatening . I can not recommend this product , regrettably , until this problem is fixed . I am using v 2.2.5 of the software , which at the time of writing is the latest version . Unfortunately there seem to be no competing products . It is almost tempting to go create one.EPICTETUS
 Save your money . The odor produced was cheap and irritating . I threw it away Buy any Indian sai baba instead !
 Looking at the ingredients list , it looks nutritious and has a decent nutritional profile ; however , I ca n't stomach it . I tried to drink a whole packet , but could only stomach half of it , before I felt too nauseated to finish it . Dumped the rest.Both this stuff and Myoplex I ca n't drink . They both taste like melted plastic.I 'm sticking to Optimum Nutrition stuff . That stuff tastes lovely . Like strawberry shake . No plastic-y tastes coming from it , and has a similar nutritional profile .
 I love Met-Rx . I have put on pounds of muscle with Met-Rx . But stick with the basic vanilla and chocolate . This does not taste like you would imagine cake batter to taste . I was so excited when it arrived that I made one right after my first workout . What a disappointment . I had visions of licking the bowl when my mom was making a cake when I was a little boy . Instead it was sort of an artifical flavor disaster . So use Met-Rx for sure , just not this flavor .
 I purchased this quite a few years back and didnt like it . I figured a decade later they would have improved on the taste ... nope . Still disgusting , even when mixed with milk . I plan to return it .
 I am a huge fan of Met RX regular chocolate and vanilla protein powders and was so excited to recieve this delicious soundingcake batter protein powder . However , after waiting for more than a week to recieve it and being super excited to try it the product proved to bea huge dissapointment . Well the consistancy was like cake batter the powder did not mix well and was thick , clumpy and dried out dispite adding lots of water the first time and almond milk the second time . Additionally this product tastes nothing like cake batter . I was expecting a delicious childhood memories eliciting flavor but what I got was chalky bland flavor . If you are going to use met rx I would highly suggest sticking to the regular chocolate or vanilla flavors which have great taste and lots of filling protein .
 The ad for this item shows 40 packets for $ 77 -LRB- about $ 15 more than last time I ordered , a couple months ago -RRB- . The detail ad says the cost per packet is $ 0.23 . It takes real magic , to divide $ 77 by 40 and get $ 0.23 -LRB- It 's actually $ 1.92 / packet -RRB- . I 'm not buying till Amazon goes to school and learns simple arithmetic .
 I ordered the Extreme Chocolate 20 packet at a lower price from this site than from the one I normally order from , only to find out at checkout that they charge an outrageous $ 10 delivery fee . I should of seen that lowball ploy coming , but went through with the order anyways . Received the order on a timely basis , but with only 18 packets instead of 20 . I e-mailed my concerns and the company did repond back timely , with an assurance that my account would be credited accordingly . When I received my credit card statement , the amount of the credit did not reflect the correct prorated amount for these missing packages . I will not use this site going forward .
 I have used Met-Rx before and I like it alot . It has a lot of protein . I got the vanilla and have also tried the chocolate . My only gripe is this company has `` NO CUSTOMER SERVICE '' and is un-responsive to email queries about their products from their website . So In my opinion , if they do not care about their customers , then I do n't buy their product again . I would recommed not buying this product , if you need assistance with it . If not , then go right a head .
 Buyer beware of the excipients that are used in your vitamins!They contain them in this brand ...
 This gel disintegrates into a thin liquid rapidly so it may be suitable for quick tests only . Its impedance matching characteristics are not too ideal when compared to standard ultrasonic gels either .
 I have had 2 . Both times the small bullet stops working all together . It is not from heavy use . I have found this product great if it works , but not reliable .
 speeds too high for me and when you slow it down it heats up too much.not what I wanted , unfortunately .
 The idea about the ring and the bullet is good , however this product is a very low quality one , first there was a problem with the contact between the bullet cable and the battery pack , second when the small bullet is inside the special compartment in the ring it eventually gets wet , and slips out of the compartment , so the idea of reusable vibrating ring is good but this product was a complete deception .
 I was excited about this product when I ordered it . I read the reviews and an off site endorsement that claimed it was `` essential '' for working on shoulder and neck muscles.This is a small device , easily held in one hand . I can use it on my neck muscles , but it does not offer enough leverage to use on my very tight shoulder muscles . I can reach the muscles with it , but I can not use it to loosen up the primary muscles I planned to use it for . I can work on the smaller muscles in my arms and it does feel relaxing to roll it over the muscles in my face . It is too small to do much good on my legs and calves.I do not find it an `` essential '' tool . Speaking for myself , I believe there are better tools to use on my shoulders that will loosen my shoulder muscles . I just have to find the right tool and this is not it .
 This powder tastes awful . Get spirulina in caplets if you just have to have it . It completely overpowers anything that you may try to mix it with .
 I even doubled up the dose and noticed nothing whatsoever . I still have half the bottle full . I do n't know if I got a bad batch or what . Coffee in general does nothing for me but I am now taking green tea . It 's cheaper and more effective .
 I do n't even know if these work because every time I start a course I develop a sore stomach within a couple of days . If you 're sensitive , this product is not for you .
 This Hair , Skin , Nails formula did n't do anything good , i really did n't notice any different only that i feel more thirsty and got a more dry mouth and body while using this formula . I do n't suggest this to anybody , save your money !
 When I first started taking this product it messed up my stomach so bad . It had me running back and forth to the bathroom and feeling sick . After a couple of days it went away . But I still have being using the bathroom frequently . It 's been three weeks and I have n't noticed a difference yet . I 'll repost in a month .
 I just started using this product two days back and my stomach is in really bad shape . I am going to give it a week or so , but if my stomach does n't improve , I will discontinue using it ...
 It di dnot help me as the other reviews claimed it did . was not very happy with it though not everyoen should expect results .
 i bought this vitamins , not sure if they work or not , but something weird happened to it , it was fine when i opened the jar , but after ciuple of months , the pills had big black dots on it and smelled like rotten fish , i didnt risk taking them , not sure why that happened ... so i opened the second sealed jar , and it was fine -LRB- yellow pills with a bit medicine smell -RRB- , lets see if it will turn rotten after a while like the first jar ... anyone has experienced this ?
 this product gives me a massive headache . if your choosing between name brand and this avoid this product all together . I am usually not sensitive to it , but this one is not a good substitute .
 I 'm sitting here in Kandahar , Afghanistan wanting to quit smoking . I 've managed to develop a 2 pack a day habit here , so I made the decision to quit . Here 's the kicker
 Brite Eyes III | 2 vials -LRB- 5 ml each -RRB- Spent $ 300 on Brite Eyes , Can-C , and Swiss drops . They gave hope , but did not work . After two years , I became 65 , got medicare , and two 10K surgeries changed me from unable to drive half blind in whiteout ... to seeing beautiful colors and being able to enjoy life again . -LRB- Colin -RRB-
 I gave this a fair try , it burned my eyes on contact , then turned them red . Customer service said the burning-stinging sensation should diminish after using awhile , used most of 1 vial without positive results.Was hoping it would work .
 I bought this product for my dog . Used it 4 times a day for almost 2 months . Saw no improvement . May have even gotten worse ... Maybe I 'll give can-c a try
 I was hopeful when I purchased this product based on the glowing reviews . After fully using one vial of the Brite Eyes according to the package directions , there was absolutely no change in my elderly dog 's cataracts . I was really hoping to clear them up somewhat so that she would be able to see better . It has been very disappointing .
 There is a lot of hype on the internet about these eye drops helping dissolve cataracts ; they did not live up to any of the claims made about them . I have used over half of the product and there is no improvement whatsoever . They are sold as `` lubricant drops '' ... if this is what you want , you can get others for a lot less money !
 I never received this product from Amazon . Amazon ignored my e-mail telling them that I did not receive this product . Apparently there is no accountability of who received this product at my address . I now purchase this product from another company even though I am an amazon affiliate with their products on a number of websites .
 This was not worth the money spent . I think if it was a more high powered it would be a lot more satisfying . I bought this for my partner and I and neither one of us really enjoyed it .
 This product 100 % did not deliver . I was excited to try it out , after all I have heard , and was totally let down . I actually got bored using it ! I finally gave up and watched tv instead . Unfortunately , considering the type of product , I am unsure if there is a return policy . Do n't waste your money ladies .
 After watching Dr. Berman on Oprah , I decided to order this Stimulator . I heard it was hot , but to my surprise , it was Smokin ! I mean smoking ! When we put the batteries in the control unit , HOT BLACK SMOKE APPEARED !!!! The next day I emailed Amazon and Healthy & Active -LRB- distributoer -RRB- to let them know the danger , and received no response . I then called the distributor and he informed me that they did not issue refunds . I could only have an exchange . Yea!If you have a fire extinquisher nearby , order this , and prepare to use it!Personally , I would n't order from Healty & Active after this , as no matter what the defect , they will not issue a refund .
 Great , fast transaction . If I would have known the size , I never would have ordered it . I gave it a `` 2 '' because I ca n't use it . If you are larger than me , this is for you . The hook at the head is serious massage .
 It really does not do the advertized job , so save your money . It is also VERY LOUD !
 This thing worked twice , once out of the package and once in use and quit . If they spent as much on quality control as the do on advertizing they might have a product .
 Only one half of the product worked the first time we tried it . It was also very cheaply made and loud . I called the company , and they did agree to send me a replacement . When the replacement came it started to smoke as soon as I turned it on -LRB- thank God I tried it before I decided to use it ! -RRB- . On top of that the company wrote that it was an adult novelty product right on the package when they shipped it -LRB- so much for `` discreet '' packaging ! -RRB- . The company offered that I could choose any product from their website as an apology . Unfortunately , there were no prices anywhere ... I did n't want to get something worth $ 5 , so I asked them to send another Adonis to me . I turned it on , and it did n't smoke , but I really have no desire to use it after the grief it 's caused me . I was incredibly disappointed with how cheaply made this product was , and will never order a Berman product again .
 This product is buried in the drawer , it is painful for me to use . The concept sure is a good one though .
 I 'm very sorry but I do n't know of a nice way to say this
 I would n't recommend this product to friends or family . The taste , consistency , and texture were offensive to me .
 I 'm 61 years old , but I have EAGLE EYE Vision , and I 'm sick to death and very disappointed that the fine print on the ingredients of the BALANCE BARS `` ALMOND BROWNIE , '' are FISH GELATIN . IF I wanted FISH products in my protein bar I 'd buy a FISH BAR , but the fact that Balance Bars use Fish Gelatin in their ALMOND BROWNIE wishes I could SHOVE THE ENTIRE 6 box order up their noses.It 's so sad the ingredients and the junk that almost any company will put in your food . I will NOT BE ORDERING THIS PRODUCT EVER AGAIN , and I doubt that although I 've been a huge balance bar customer , that I 'll EVER ORDER BALANCE BARS again , as they are FISH GELATIN bars in truth . SEE LABEL.I 'm done .
 I would have to say I was not very impressed by the quality and taste of this product . I guess I really expected more from this product , as they seem so expensive . The peanut-butter taste was very strong and the texture was very grainy and dry . I do n't think that these bars are very filling . You have to drink a lot of water with them to even get them down . I would not recommend this product to my friends .
 While I do like the bars themselves , I feel that Amazon resorted to bait and switch . I signed up for a subscription -LRB- monthly delivery -RRB- , and the 2nd month they raised the price 50 % . Needless to say , I canceled the subscription , as I can buy it cheaper locally .
 The other Balance bars I 've tried taste much better -LRB- Balance Gold , with peanut butter , I believe -RRB- . These taste awful - chalky , cardboard-like . And it 's not just me - no one in my family likes them !
 I at these for years and really liked the way they taste . Then I did some research and found out that much of their protein is from gelatin or collagen which is 100 % worthless to humans for building/maintaining muscle because the amino acid is not good . Also lots of palm kernel oil in these which is n't too good for you . There are much better options out there . If you want something with better protein -LRB- but still has some palm kernel oil -RRB- and tastes great , try Metabolic Drive protein bars . If you are ok with eating something that is just ok tasting , then Zero Impact are by far the best bars out there . Great protein , healthy fats , low sugar , no sugar alcohols . I have n't found one bad thing about them . I just feel ripped off for the years I spent eating Balance Bars .
 I eat these bars all the time and thought it would be a good deal and convenient to get them from Amazon . But , they were horrible . Stale and crumbly and deformed . I complained and customer service sent me replacement bars , but they were exactly the same - inedible . They refunded my money , which I appreciated.Based on this experience , I will never purchase food from amazon.com .
 I buy Balance Bar Nutrition Energy Bars on a regular basis so I decided to buy them online . They arrived in less than 6 days . The order was placed Jan-17-2011 , I received the Balance bars today , Jan-21-2011 , the expiration date is Jan-20-2011 - yesterday . I am NOT eating these . Unacceptable . I have read earlier reviews stating problems with the expiration dates . Maybe the reviews are worth taking into consideration .
 If you like foods that are VERY sweet , you might like these bars , but for many people , they may be overpoweringly sweet . They also have a weird crunchy-ness . I do like the fact that Balance bars contain lots of protein and vitamins .
 I love the peanut butter Balance Bars . People say these are good , but I thought they were horrible . My husband and older son did not like them either .
 I really did n't care for the product . It was very dry in my mouth . Not a whole lot of flavor , and the filling had a powdery feeling to it . The chocolate on the outside was good but again , not too much flavor . It needed to be sweeter , and the raspberry flavoring was weak . Tasted like I was eating an old candy bar , and a stale one at that . I had to keep checking it to see if it was old and out of date . I actually gagged on it a couple times while eating it . I did eat several of them -LRB- nine -RRB- . The wrapper looks too formal , not appealing to the eye . It made me feel like I was eating a health bar and not a fun item ! I thought the carbs were a bit too high also . It did give me a full feeling when I finished with it . Did n't fulfill the need for something sweet , though . If I 'm going to eat chocolate , I want to know I ate chocolate . I would n't recommend this to my family or friends . I 'd rather recommend Slim Fast Bars for the vitamins and health aspects .
 I 'm sorry to say that I was n't impressed with Balance Bar 40-30-30 . Quite frankly , it tasted horrible ! I could n't finish the first bar to see if it satisfied my hunger or sustained my energy . I would n't recommend this to my friends .
 I bought this 12-pack of peanut butter Balance bars and noticed some white stuff on the bars when I opened them before eating . I shaved them off with a knife . Then I went to look for Cliff bars at Amazon and noticed a bunch of reviews complaining about white stuff or staleness in the bars they ordered . Bottomline
 I am in the process of trying to lose weight , and this seemed a great way to skip lunch but still get all the nutrients I needed . When the Balance Bars arrived , I was surprised to get a whole box , enough for a two-week supply , plus one . My husband and I immediately pulled out that '' `` plus one '' '' to give it a taste . The bar looked delectable and smelled wonderful , but that was as far as it went . They are plain awful ! The chocolate coating is good , but whatever they have on the inside is sickening . It 's not very sweet , but it 's the texture that 's so bad . It 's like chewing wet sawdust . We immediately spit ours out , and the box of 14 is still sitting on my counter . I would definitely not pay money for these . Skip them and go on to Slim Fast , is what I 'd tell my friends and family . They definitely need to do some work on this product , not just that flavor .
 We returned this item because we thought it did not taste as it does usually . We buy them all the time and the ones we bought in our grocery store after this incident were normal tasting.With food you can not take risks
 At first I thought the Balance Bar tasted like sawdust , but I sort of got used to that after awhile . The bar is n't moist enough . I need a glass of milk wash it down or it 's hard to swallow . The taste was OK , but not something I 'd buy really . I 'd say if you 're on a diet and want a nice 200-calorie lunch , get a salad with a nice low-cal dressing instead .
 The only way I can describe these bars is with the word sweet . Too sweet , in fact . They have a good taste as long as you have a real sweet tooth . They 're good on the run , but unless you 're used to lots of sugar in the morning , I would n't recommend them for breakfast . Maybe in place of dessert though .
 The cookie dough flavor is okay , but not the best . The texture is a little too gooey . I have only eaten a few of these bars and I am already sick of them . I got them the same time as I got some Clif bar White Chocolate Macadamia , and those are by far superior to the balance bar.Hopefully the other flavors are better than this , but I think for now I will stick with Clif bars .
 I love the original Mocha Chip balance bars . They were terrific . But , they put them in new packaging -LRB- fine , who cares , right ? -RRB- but they also re-formulated them and it 's really sad what they 've done to them . They 're sickly sweet now , they have a cake-y consistency that 's not appealing and there 's barely a `` chip '' in sight.It 's all bad . I bought tons of these and ate them for breakfast . No more . The new ones are so bad , I threw out the ones I bought after trying a few times to eat them .
 I bought Yogurt-Honey-Peanut bars from DAB . What I received was not fresh , even though the expiration date was almost 8 months ahead . Compared to the taste of the fresh ones you can buy in your local stores , the taste of this one was really bad and it was really painful eating it . The appearance of the bar also suggested having some problems , before even tasting it.I do n't think the food is preserved in conditions that would guarantee freshness , and I do n't think I am going to buy from the same seller again.Note
 I have to agree with `` R.Katz '' They are incredibly chalky and cardboard like . They also have a strong dark chocolate taste . I do n't particularly enjoy dark chocolate ; those that do might enjoy these . The bars I received were well within their expiration date . -LRB- 10 months to go -RRB- OK but certainly not the best Balance Bar flavor .
 I suppose if you 're just looking for fuel for your body or emergency food to keep in your trunk , then these would be okay . If I 'd purchased this box of Balance Bars , I would 've brought it back to the store for a refund . The taste was pretty bad , and the consistency was gummy/muddy . It 's better if you have it with a full glass of water , although there 's a very strong aftertaste . My husband took a bite and spit it out -- the same with my six year old . My two-year-old son , however , seemed to actually like it and will eat a bar as a snack if I broke it up into small pieces . I just could n't get past the taste . I still have over a box left , which I 'll dole out to my son as snacks , but it 's defiantly not something I would ever buy or recommend . In fact , if someone told me they were going to buy them , I 'd ask if they 'd ever eaten them before and if not , I would tell them pick a different product . Big thumbs down on this one !
 Personally I found this bar to be very untasty . One bite was truly enough for me . They may be very healthy , which is great , but to me if I 'm going to eat something , it has to taste good , and this does n't meet that requirement .
 We did n't find these to be all that tasty . They had a mealy kind of texture . If you 're very very hungry they 'd be okay to eat . Perhaps they just were n't suited to our family 's taste buds .
 Overall , I did n't like this product . It has a very thick and gooey center that 's very hard to swallow unless I have a lot of water to wash it down with . The flavor was n't too bad , but if they could just change it so was n't so gummy ... I would n't recommend this product to my family and friends .
 The bars I recevied were past the `` Best when used by '' date by . Also , the bars were the original formula and not the new formula .
 I purchased this in hopes of curbing one of my cats ' IBS issues . Unfortunately this product gave my cat a reaction ; violent vomiting after eating it . In fact , my poor cat was trying to run away from himself while vomiting , he was so scared!I measured everything correctly and after mixing it in with his food is when he had the reaction . I wo n't be purchasing this again and I 've since thrown it away . I now use Purina 's FortiFlora and am very satisfied with the results.Just a quick note , they only give the measurement per cup of food , they do n't give any sort of variation for smaller servings .
 The service was good and the product is as described , but there is one reason I 'm rating it with two stars . I had similar thing and I was n't happy with it , because it often slipped off my belt -LRB- it had a belt clip -RRB- or the clip slipped off the case.This one is with loop , but the seller -LRB- and the photo -RRB- does n't tell you , that this loop has button , which unbuttons relatively easy and the result is the same - you can easily lose the thing.One more drawback that all the similar products have - the case does n't protect the lighter very well - the front button may scratch it , because -LRB- part of it -RRB- appears inside the pouch .
 This product is n't bad in terms of effectiveness , but its strong and NAUSEATING SMELL literally made me gag . It smells sickeningly sweet like a pound of saccharine or something . What the heck were the manufacturers thinking when they think that this is an ok smell to put on one 's face ?! Sigh , I still have 3 jars left ... I have only put this on my hands so far because I ca n't stand the smell .
 I was tricked into buying this after reading the review , I wore it several times after I got it and got suspicious as I did not feel any benefit . I went online and try to find out more about this technology , if you do some googling you will know that it has no scientific evident and major trustworthy health and science site also urge people to not fall for this . I should have done my homework before spending money .
 Smokers can largely be put into two groups
 This is a cool idea done badly ! It came with a dumb flower on the front - yeah just what my boyfriend did NOT want to carry around , but the ugly thing fell off on the first day anyway !!
 hoy 18/01/2013 no ha llegado le producto y dice que la entrega es el 17/01/2013 es decir va un dia de mas y nada uqe se mueve ! irresponsabilidad del vendedor se llama eso no lo recomiendo !
 While convenient , it is difficult to clean since the spring does n't work and the top is impossible to remove .
 That previous review can only have been written by a representative of the company . I purchased this product last week at Whole Foods . From the research I did , I knew that TRUE oil of oregano is hot to the taste . So I bit into one of these `` oil of oregano '' capsules , with its thick gelatin lining , and the tiny amount of substance inside tasted entirely like olive oil . Olive oil ! It had a slight taste of oregano , but certainly no more than your cooking after you put a dash of the spice into your food . So the lesson
 Solaray - Oil Of Oregano , 150 mg , 60 softgelsI have been researching the benefits of oil of oregano . It is said to be a natural antiseptic , fungicide , fights bacteria and viruses . I could n't wait to find a good product . I purchased some Solaray Oil of Oregano the health food store and began taking it . I did n't experience any immediate results from one capsule so I started taking two . Still no results.I had read reviews about how strong oil of oregano is and how it can burn your skin or tongue so I decided to cut open one of the capsules and put it directly on my skin . RESULTS
 The description of this product states that there is no added starch and yet the first ingredient is cornstarch . My boyfriend took this when I ordered it for him after checking the ingredients on amazon but without reading the fine print on the bottle . He is on a starch free diet because starch makes him flare up . Well now it has been about three days and he is still in severe pain . I am extremely unhappy with this and I have learned an important lesson ; you ca n't trust that the product you receive will match the description online .
 This product did not work as well as CM Responce for me , even if I took twice as much.It may work for others though .
 I had great hopes for this product because Cetyl Myristoleate in small capsules or softgels is really hard to find . Unfortunately , the tube-shaped capsules in this product are too hard to swallow , so the CetylPure product fails -LRB- for me -RRB- . Cetyl Myristoleate in smaller softgels is available in other brands , but hard to find .
 I took this according to the directions for a month . I only wanted to lose 10 pounds , but did n't lose a single pound , so I ca n't recommend this product .
 It didnt help me one bit ... I noticed nothing !!! for the money i spent i was very disapointed !!!!
 This is not Auric Blends incense . Do n't be fooled . The order arrived 2 weeks after I ordered it -LRB- past the estimated delivery date -RRB- , and as soon as I pulled the package out of the mail , I could smell the cheap incense that it was before even opening the envelope . This is a cheap , knock-off incense . Do n't buy .
 I carefully read all of the Amazon reviews because I wanted to get a non-smelling Bringaraj oil . Vadik 's version has a very strong and overpowering smell but it works as in it grows your hair.This oil damaged my hair , and dried out my scalp . It does have a very minimal smell that quickly goes away but the product does n't work . Its back to Vadik which smells strong but at least I have a head full of healthy hair.Be careful of the hype I found it to be completely untrue .
 I do n't like this oil at all . Not only is it greasy , but it smells mostly like sesame seed oil , which has me wondering if that 's the main ingredient rather than the bhringaraj . I also do n't notice any difference in my hair other than it smells like my hands after eating a greasy pizza .
 I bought this oil and started using it to help grow my hair . I am from India and I know what `` real '' hair oil should be . This is a watered down `` American '' version of a traditional Indian hair oil . The oil should be `` made in India '' to use the correct base oil and herbs . I called the company up and after the representative sound nervous by me asking questions , she told me the oil is made in the USA !! What a joke ! If I want something Indian , I want it made in India ! Is that asking a lot ? I do n't want a Toyota car that is `` made in America '' . Anyways , sorry for the ranting but the oil does n't work and is a real `` fake '' . Sorry Banyan . I have read good reviews on Vadik Herbs and other brands so I 'll check them out and let you all know ...
 DO NOT BUY THIS PRUDUCT.This vendor very unrelable you put order in . They charge you but you never recive your stuff.If you do n't investigate they never respone to you.If you want to get robe go for it
 Based on the confused feed back it grows hair , but yet it does not , a real bizzarre review it sounds like someone is confused and has no problem confusing every one else . I have never tried this product but , based on the stupidity that this reviewer decided to give , I probably would not try it , then on the other hand if I was as coffused as this reviewer I might . Bottom line does it work or does it not work .
 The product I received was not what I ordered . It was a different type of Pantene . I returned the package the same day , -LRB- at my expense -RRB- because it was not what I ordered . I was a 25.4 oz bottle , but not the Pro V , Daily Moisture Renewal Moisturizing Shampoo for Dry or Damaged hair . I was very disappointed that it was not the right kind because I had searched quite a while for it .
 Dear pantene , Let me share with my fellow millions of internet shoppers my experience with your 2 in 1 `` moisture renewals '' . When I was in the united states , your 2 in 1 `` moisture renewal '' was soooo good it set the standard to me by which to judge the rest of the shampoos I will be using for the rest of my life
 I purchased this a couple of days ago ... now I guess it would take some time to see results because it 's like taking a vitamin to me ... Nothing changed what so ever for me . Is this for real or is the Millegrams not enough . No energy or nothing came out of them .
 So this stuff is wonderful because it 's all natural and actually works , right ? Well , unfortunately , the price is that NOBODY will go near you when this is on you - even you will want to keep away from yourself ! This stuff STINKS !!!
 Bought this item expecting a decent product . My fault for not looking at the product more closely . I was expecting the same `` One Love '' fragrance as Auric Blends sells but instead got something else . Smells nice but will not stay burning .
 I was very disappointed in this product . I ran the dishwasher once and there was still quite a bit of food stuck on my dishes . I ran it a second time just to see if it would help and it did n't . I ended up rewashing the whole load by hand because I simply did n't trust that anything really got clean . I 'm one of those that basically washes the dishes before loading the dishwasher and I really hoped that this would elminate that step for me , but unfortunately my search continues ...
 Has anyone had small green pieces in the box of Cascade dishwasher powder?Would be interested to know if anyone had this problem . . The box i bought has a lot of these pieces in it . I did not use it .
 I bought this pad for its larger size . I have n't seen any other brands with 34 '' length -- those extra inches are really nice for a toddler ! However the plastic material tears soooo easily . My last pad -LRB- diff ' t manuf . -RRB- held up for 16 months before developing one small tear . This one developed its first tear in the first week and 3 months later it is riddled with big tears . We 're so careful when changing our LO and do n't wear any rings or bracelets which might snag on the pad , but nonetheless it tears . We now have to buy another smaller one as this one is no longer useable after 3 short months .
 Got this in the mail and the tag attached to this changer pad is DISTURBING.Do not want anything near my newborn with a tag that reads
 And it arrived at my niece 's punctured and distorted . Surely something intended for a baby should be better protected ! As my niece is 8 months pregnant and it 's hot , I told her to toss it , rather than go through the aggro of returning . So I 'm out the full amount .
 The size of this product -- for an adult male -- is about one third of what it should be . I 'd received the same product from my physical therapist some years ago
 I 'm a 57yo female with medium size hands . I love having all the different colors and strength . I 've recently started martial arts and firearm safety classes . My firearm instuction mentioned I need to strengthen my trigger finger . This is an excellent way to do that . Smooth transaction . Glad I purchased .
 I was prescribed some therapy putty for my RSD after significantly improving my hand strength and motor skills in physical therapy . My insurance sent me the Cando Theraputty Hand Exercise Putty , 4oz , Green , from amazon and I was shocked when I opened the package to find a decent sized plastic container with only a tiny bit of putty.The putty itself weighs 2oz , with the container close to 3oz -- still NOT EVEN CLOSE TO 4oz stated in the product description.Therapy putty is great for restoring function to your hands , but buy from a different manufacturer that wo n't cheat you .
 do n't buy . these are cheap batteries . get what u pay for . they do n't last long at all . i stick with duracell now
 I got sucked into this deal about a year ago and can say long term , risky cells.It could be because the clock draws even when the radio part is off but I ` mnot willing to chance it again .
 I was disappointed . These were not the Memorex Batteries I usually see , these are made in China and look like knock offs.I have n't used them yet , so they may be O.K. , expecially at that price , but I feel like I was missled.I also found I could buy Batteries at Costco for the same price .
 Product was recieved quickly and burns fine , it just doesnt smell like Nightqueen . Would suggest the essential oils instead . : -LRB-
 When I received this product it was old and smelled funny . I 'd never used it before , so I dont know what color it is supposed to be . Looking at the picture I assumed that it would be an opaque honey color , but it was brown which led me to believe that it was old . It also smelled funny ... like old olive oil . Oh well , you live and you learn .
 Though it apears to be a good deal only about half of them actually work . I think they were just old batteries .
 Have ordered from this company before and all was well . This time , I ordered multiple packages for a discount . Then , when I pulled out the first package and realized the batteries did n't fit , it was past the return policy deadline . Am contacting the seller directly to see if the situation can be rectified ; but , I do n't have much hope .
 The first four batteries went dead as soon I put it on the device . Tried a different pack and worked for two days , I will not buy from this vendor again .
 It seems there is something wrong with the batteries . They do not even last for 1 hour and they should last for at least 5 days . Is there a number I can call to talk with Local Battery ?
 They are no good if they work at all it 's only for a hour or two ! These battery are junk !!
 Let me start by stating that I do n't normally write reviews . The rare occasion I write a review is if a product is exceptional or horrible . Unfortunately , these are not exceptional . I am reviewing the product , not the purchase through Amazon.I purchased these batteries based on what I thought would be a good price deal . I 'm a bilateral BTH wearer and I usually buy batteries from Costco in bulk or single packs from one of the chain drug stores . Those batteries typically last for a full week , both name and drug store brands . I wear my aids from the time I wake up until the time I go to bed . When they are out the battery case is opened so the batteries do n't drain.The first of THESE batteries I used lasted for a whopping 1 HOUR before my aid started signaling that the battery was dying . The second of THESE batteries did not work AT ALL . I 've gone through 2 packs already in about 2 weeks because most of the batteries are either duds or last for less than 3 days . There are times when a new battery was just put in and my aid will immediately start signaling its dying and I open & close the battery case a few times and then its fine . I 'm constantly worrying that they are going to die unexpectedly though.Going through these batteries as fast as I am means that the good deal I THOUGHT I was getting is n't so . Save your money - buy the batteries you usually do , not these .
 I bought a pack of 60 about two years ago and have three cards left . They have an expiry date of 08/2013 . They were fine for the first 18 months but now 25 % of them are no good . Last week I took one aid to the audiologist as it was n't working properly -- and I had just put a new battery in it . He tested the battery and said it was dead . He advised there are four factories world-wide that make zinc-air batteries -- some are good , some are not-so-good quality . The audiologist kindly gave me his battery tester gratis and recommended in future buying brand-name batteries from a place with high turnover . Another customer at the counter overhearing the conversation said avoid pharmacies . He 'd had dud brand-name batteries from the pharmacy -- they do n't sell enough to turn them over . The audiology practice sells only Rayovac batteries ; I bought a pack and left.Since then I have had to replace a couple more batteries . Two of the Icelltech batteries lasted a few minutes -- the tester showed them to be dead . Looks like I 'm going to have to bin the last couple of cards of batteries.Summary -- these batteries are best avoided . It will cost extra to buy quality batteries but if you do n't have to discard 25 % of them out of the pack you 're better off .5 Feb 2012 - Update . Just threw out the last two cards - every one a dud .
 I ordered the 12.5 grams size -LRB- 10cc -RRB- for $ 10.93 NOW Foods , LAVILIN UNDERARM DEODORANT CREAM - 12.5 gm -LRB- 10cc -RRB- as a Prime Member . I had been debating whether to buy the size I did or the .44 oz size thinking it was more given it was in ounces and the higher price of $ 13.99 . I found out that .44 oz is the same as 12.5 grams when I went to this site -LSB- ... -RSB- . In fact .44 oz is actually 12.473790164 grams rounded up to 12.5 . Please do go the the site to check it out . Same amount just charged more because it sounds like more product . I did hit the `` Contact Us '' button to speak with an Amazon Customer Service rep to report this . The woman I spoke with wrote up a report and told me she would forward it for investigation . As I just ordered Lavalin I can not give an accurate review at this time but I will after I receive it and use it long enough to form enough of an opinion to leave feedback for it .
 I have used Lavilin underarm deodorant for several years in the black box and black jar . It only allowed a very light sweat and when I applied it it lasted at least 3 days before I started to smell an odor again.I recommended it to a lot of people.I loved it !!! Then several months ago they said they changed the packaging but had the same great product.Well , I was almost out of it in the black package so I re-ordered for myself and my college aged daughter who has used it for a few years also . Within days I knew that it was NOT the same product I used to use . It went on smoother then the old one . True , `` okay , that 's good I thought '' , but very quickly I noticed it allowed me to sweat a LOT more VS the old product that only allowed a very light sweat.Also if I apply it on Monday , by Tuesday evening my under arms smell bad again . I shower 3 - 4 times a day . Vs before if I applied it Monday morning I started to smell only a slight odor by Wednesday nightThen my daughter told me -LRB- without me saying anything to her first -RRB- that hers in the new package is NOT working as well as it did in the black packaging . Before she only had a very light sweat and she had no odor for 5 days . Now , by the third day she said has terrible odor and immediately after applying it she said she sweats so profusely that it soaks up the under arm area of her sleeves.She 's really upset about the change because this worked so magically for us before.Now I have to carry a folded up napkin in my purse to keep swiping the sweat under my arms or they slip and slide . That NEVER happened with the old product.I KNOW they changed it . I recently found a black jar of the old product with a few applications worth in it . I had left in a suitcase when I had went on vacation and forgot about it.So , I applied it to my underarms and lo and behold ! I only had a light sweat and no odor again for three days . I used the last two applications of it up and then had to go back to my new White jar that went on smoother . Back to sweating profusely after applying it and stinking again by the next night.I wish they would go back to the stronger thicker product.I 'd gladly pay more for it . As it is now . I will stop using it and my daughter and I are going to the health food store to try and find something else . Sad after all these years to have to stop using it . I ca n't stand the constant slipping and sliding under my arms due to profuse sweating and then to be smelly again within 30 hours after applying it VS the 3 days it used to last.Hlavilin Industries Ltd. . PLEASE bring back the old Product or you 're going to lose a lot of customers .
 I have used this product for several years . I found the old product in the black container to be working very well . When the company changed its packaging , they also must have changed the formula , because ever since I started using the product from the white container , it does not work at all . It spreads easier , but so what ? I find it to be useless , ineffective , and a waste of money .
 I had been using Lavilin -LRB- black container -RRB- on my underarms for 30 years and had been recommending it to everyone I knew . When I recently bought some of the new `` white container '' Lavilin , and applied it , I soon found out that this was not the product I was familiar with . After only one day , the odor came back . After reapplying a few times I got the same negative results . Normally , this time of year -LRB- spring in MN -RRB- , I get at least 1-1/2 weeks out of it -LRB- 3 weeks in the winter -RRB- . I was told by a local retailer that the original formula was no longer available -LRB- they had removed the talc in 2001 -RRB- . I am guessing that they changed more than the talc since this is a non-functional product for me . I hope that I can get my money back since I had bought four containers to stock up .
 I 've been using lavilin for many years . But this new version is nowhere NEAR as effective as the old version in the black round box.My bet it the major deodorant companies have bought the Lavilin company , or have paid them off in some way to make this VASTLY INFERIOR product.z
 According to most of the reviews this is a great product . I followed all the intructions , no deodorant before use , etc. . . It did n't work at all.I think , it actually gave me more bad odor . Like eeeew odor.There is a better product that this one.So , sorry .
 The old adage , `` If it sounds too good to be true , it probably is , '' is perfectly applicable to Lavilin . I researched this product and read the reviews here -LRB- among others -RRB- and decided to try it with a positive attitude . To be fair , Lavilin is better than nothing in that it offers very , very minimal protection against odor as opposed to using nothing at all . However , after weeks of use I have come to find that eight to ten hours is as far as any real deoderant protection lasts , after that the least bit of excercise , etc. , causes a significant increase in underarm odor that is very noticeable . Daily application is necessary , and that coverage is marginal at best . Yes , I followed the application instructions TO THE LETTER . I think the rave reviews for Lavilin are mostly due to wishful thinking . My recommendation is do not be taken in by this modern version of Snake Oil .
 This product should more accurately be named `` Deoderant Glue '' . I only applied it once and that was enough for me to know that I was unhappy with this product . The deoderant is about like semi-hardened glue . It was extremely difficult to rub onto my skin . When I put my arms down and lifted them back up , the deoderant actually made my armpit skin stick to other surrounding skin . And then I tried to wash the deoderant off my fingers , from where I had applied it ... very difficult . I had to wash my hands 4 times and they stick felt a little sticky!I left the deoderant on for the day , instead of trying to wash it off as I was so tempted to do . After a couple of hours , the sticky eventually `` soaked '' into my skin ??? I did not try to reapply the product the next day because my underarms were already irritated from all the attempted rubbing-in of the deoderant from the day before.Personally , I was seeking an alternative to regular deoderant due to a sudden allergic reaction to my current deoderant . I was under the impression that this deoderant was intended for folks , like me , with sensitive underarm skin ??? If this is why you are seeking out Lavilin , look elsewhere . This deoderant just caused additional irritation to my already irritated underarms.FYI , I ended up finding that I could use Arm N Hammer Natural deoderant , in the fragrance free formula . I recommend trying it first as it is readily available at most drug stores : -RRB-
 Big box , small container . Actually a container in a container . It reminds me of the wine bottles with the huge indention in the bottom . The old container lasted a couple months . This one lasts a little over a month . $ 12 for the product , $ 6 postage . I am in search of a zinc oxide underarm deodorant that is not full of talc and has more than tablespoon of product .
 I was really hoping this would work , but it did n't . I went the 48 hours without applying other deoderant -LRB- like the directions said -RRB- before I tried Lavilin . I then applied it at night and showered in the morning . However I was still sweating and it did not prevent the perspiration odor from occuring later that day . I gave it one more try by using it after I showered but that did n't work either .
 I have used Lavilin for many , many years and am truly disappointed that the company changed the formula and I now get about half as long from one application . With the black container I did not have to apply deodorant for 10 to 15 days . With the new formula in the white container it only lasts 3 to 5 days .
 I was extremely disappointed in the performance of this deodorant especially after all the positive reviews I 'd read . I followed the preparation directions to a `` T '' . applied the cream Monday morning and by early afternoon , I had started smelling . Now , I 'm 60 years old and the most strenuous exercise I get is a brisk walk . Monday it was 73 degrees and I had my brisk walk and started smelling . Not after two or three days but after only 4 hours . I decided to carry on for a few more hours and the smell worsened . Tried applying again being more careful to spread evenly and more widely and still the same outcome so I 've given up . It 's all fine and dandy to try to try and not use alcohol or aluminum based deodorants but when even I ca n't stand to be around me why should I inflict the smell on other people ?
 LAVILLIN IS CRAP !! I never got to try the `` old formula '' everyone is talking about , but I can tell about a deodorant cream that is probably the same as the `` old formula '' . Go TO
 It did n't work for me . I wanted to , I expected it to , but it just did n't . Before I first used this product , I stayed away from using aluminum deodorant for almost one month . I applied this to myunderarm , it gave off a not so good odor . It made me sweat , and sweat mixed with this product is hell . But still I decided to give it one more chance . I used this for more almost 2 months , noting really happened . I guess this is one of the products that is not meant for me . After all this , I have never used any anti-perspirant/deodorant at all . I just sometimes rub alcohol or Purell on my underarms when I know I started to sweat . That kinda worked for me , and Im sticking to it .
 For those reviewers that get multi-day protection from this product , I 'm envious . I get 24 hour protection ... that 's it.The instructions that come with the product state that a single application eliminates perspiration odor up to 7 days.Now , maybe I did n't use the product exactly as the directions stipulated . They tell you to refrain from using any other deodorant for 48 hours prior to your first application of Lavilin . Well , I have too much respect for my family , friends and complete strangers to do that . Ai n't happening.But , I have been using if for a few weeks now , so I figure the old deodorant has long since been eliminated from my system . My results are n't getting any better . It works great for a day . After that , I 'm not willing to risk going deodorant free for another day . I 'm not sure if it 's just me , or if some of the other reviewers are more at peace with their natural self . `` Hey , I used my deodorant last week . You must be smelling something else '' . Bottom line ... this is incredibly expensive deodorant . It 's in cream form . You have to apply it with your finger . Unless you 're incredibly flexible , it 's gon na take a finger on each hand . The large size is less than half an once . My regular deodorant was 3.25 oz . and a quarter the price . If the price was more in line with other deodorants , I would not balk at all . I prefer it to the smelly greasy normal stuff . But , without the multi-day protection that others enjoy , It 's a little too spendy for me.UPDATE ... I eventually did attain the multi-day protection that others speak of . I can never tell just how many days protection I will get ... sometimes it 's over a week ... sometimes two days . All in all , I kinda like this stuff . I would probably rate this item a couple of stars higher now .
 This was the worst product ever . It did not work at all . The company does not back their product . I could not return the item , how else will I know if it works unless I use it . I relied on the reviews to buy the product and the reviews was false . I do n't know if it was real people filling them out or was it the company busting there product . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT , IT IS A RIP OFF ...
 This just did n't work . I waited the three days of using no deoderant per the instructions . I tried applying sparingly -LRB- it did n't work -RRB- . I tried applying liberally -LRB- still did n't work -RRB- . The cream has the smell and consistency of diaper rash cream and contains a lot of zinc - so perhaps this is just modified diaper cream ! I do n't mind sweating -LRB- as I did with this product -RRB- but I had smelly pits in less than a day . I 'm now off to try Herbal Magic Roll-On deoderant , recommended by several friends at work .
 I 've never had trouble finding a deodorant that worked , but one that does n't irritate my skin has been elusive . I really hoped Lavilin would do the job , but it completely failed me . While it was gentle on my skin , it was completely ineffective . I abstained from other deodorants for 48 + hours and then applied Lavilin after showering , yet by the next day my armpits were getting pretty `` pungent '' . I showered again and reapplied the Lavilin , this time quite liberally - only to be greeted by the return of odor by the next morning . Summing it up , Lavilin is
 My wifes navigator broke and the wheels fell off and she fell and hurt her self badly . They are very unsafe and I do not recommend it to anyone . The wheel fell off twice and i had to drill it out and put new better hardware on it . Then before I trashed it the other wheel literally busted in the middle nad collapsed and almost tossed her out again . The company had us sign a release with the promise of a replacement transport chair but did not ever honor their offer.The company scammed us and would not replace the chair . Do not buy or deal with that company or buy this unsafe chair for you will regret it .
 For about a year I was trying all kinds of supplements to improve my health , including this one . But , I never noticed a difference , so I have quit taking this -- and most of the others . I 'm not saying it does n't work , I 'm just saying for me , I could n't tell any difference . Money is tighter now that we 're nearing retirement so I ca n't afford to keep spending money on supplements that do n't make me feel any better , or give me any better test results , sorry .
 This do n't work plain and simple not sure whats up with all the good reviews here , but I bough some glucosamine from wallmart work better than this . If you want to waste your money go right ahead I wont .
 The old cruisers were much better . The new improved ones are not `` improved '' at all . I agree with Ferrety4 in the last review . This Grandma got a sample pack of the `` improved '' Cruisers , it was enough to steer me clear!I want to spend time with my Grandson rather than doing laundry because of some silly purple striped diaper leaking ! Take it from a Granny who has 3 sons and 1 Grandson ... Purple is not good for males no matter what their age !!!
 Great claims about slower metabolism than plain sugar , but no glycemic index numbers on the package or website . There are no values for amount of sugar contained or any other nutritional values on the packaging or website . It calls itself `` 100 % Pure Birch Sugar . '' Actually , Xylitol is an alcohol sugar , as are Mannitol and Sorbitol . When I looked it up , Wikipedia stated , `` Xylitol is produced by hydrogenation of xylose , which converts the sugar -LRB- an aldehyde -RRB- into a primary alcohol . '' How `` natural '' is this ? There are no warnings about the laxation potential to cause intestinal problems such as diarrhea , flatulence and bloating . Apparently the same processes are not used to refine this sweetener as an often used `` surreal step '' described for some white and brown sugars . But , there is no information about the processes used to extract this Xylitol as `` a byproduct of -LSB- trees cut down for -RSB- the furniture industry in Finland . '' The quotes are from the packaging , except for the words between the symbols -LSB- -RSB- or as noted from Wikipedia 's website today.The price was ok , and the product is sweet , but contributes to reflux or heartburn for me as much as white sugar does .
 I tried it for a weeks taking it once a day as directed on the bottle but I did not see any change . So I stopped .
 I read all the reviews before I ordered this product , plus went to the website and read about it . I ordered it with the hope it would help but I did n't find any difference when taking it . My Edema is just as bad asbefore so I can truthfully say it did not help me . I can not say this is a bad product because each of us are different and our bodies react differently to products ... all we can do is try a product to see how our body reacts to it .
 I am sorry I believed reviews . This product is waste of money pure and simple . If one wants any edema or fluid retention tablets they should , as I should have , see their doctor .
 I have genetic lymphedema in one leg . Tried Capisette for 5 months with no appreciable difference in swelling . Nothing else has worked very well either .
 Took it for 3 months and saw no results whatsoever . Would not recommend this product at all . It was a waste of time and money .
 I tried this product to reduce the amount of fluid I was retaining . I was very disappointed with the results . Capisette did not work for me at all ... Sorry !
 not worth time or money -- just do not pick up dirt and get lint covered if washed -- love the sponge but not these
 I was surprised that it really did n't do much compared to the 1950s version that I 'd inherited . Keeping a wet wash cloth next to my bed for when I start coughing in the middle of the night works better .
 The pen has great weight and functionality . However , I was expecting it to write and flow good . It sucks . The G2 Pilot writes better for a fraction of the price .
 This is an excellent pen but a mediocre-at-best stylus . The pen portion does everything well ; red , black , pencil . It feels excellent in your hand and is solidly built . The downside is that when used as a stylus I have to press down significantly in order for my phone to register the swipe . I have a free pen / stylus that I got from a trade show that is MUCH better on the stylus side . In the end this item is just ok .
 I have a problem with the refil -LRB- black -RRB- the liquid no working good . regular product
 Cheap feel . Cheap innards . Broke quickly . Now in the trash . Wish I got my money back . I really did not like this product .
 I will prepare a video review for everyone to see what I am really talking about . It says in the leaflet inside your new Tech3 that Cross offers a lifetime as stated on their website as well
 The product description says `` Glucosamine 1500 mg , Chondroitin 800 mg , MSM 750mg Caplets '' & `` each tablet containing 1,500 milligrams of glucosamine and 800 milligrams of chrondroitin '' . I am looking at the bottle I just got , and it says each caplet contains
 I can understand if a product is very near expired or even very recently expired ; however , more than 2 years passed the expiration date -LRB- Sept 2009 -RRB- seems like a violation of FDA regulations , and common decency .
 I 've been shelling out money every couple of months now for this product and have seen no improvement whatsoever . I think this , like so many other supplements we take , are a hoax . I have been taking this for over 6 months now and my joints seem worse than before I started taking it . I have had knee xrays and have been told by 2 doctors my bones are fine . There is no arthritis or anything else going on in my joints . Needless to say , this has been another waste of my money.I have also researched glucosamine , chondroitin and MSM supplements on the internet . Studies by major universities and labs either find that there are worthless and do nothing for you or the results are inconclusive . Bottom line is , I found no research that states these supplements actually work .
 not at all what i expected . maybe the ones with the blue tips would be more what i 'm looking for . these are not good .
 I was disappointed with this incense , as it was not at all the same as the Egyptian Goddess incense that I had once bought directly from the company -LRB- Auric Blends -RRB- . The density of the incense was much smaller and the scent was not the same . Not sure what happened here .
 My wife did n't like this , not very soft material and very rigid back which makes it difficult to sit down while wearing it .
 I used it a few days , can not use it often since it makes my belly itchy and reddish . I guess I 'm allergic to the fabric they used . When I wear it I do n't feel any support either . It 's also noticible from outside of your clothes that there is something on your belly .
 I never got to wear this because it was so hard to assemble especially if your by yourself with a 7 month belly . I tried to have my husband assist but we both got so frustrated with it . I would suggest just buying a band that goes under your belly and does not have 3 or 4 different parts to apply around your belly .
 What a waste of money . If you are able to get this product on correctly -LRB- good luck -RRB- , it is horrible . When I received it I wasnt having any back or pelvic pain . OnceI put it on my back started to hurt . And have fun sitting with this thing . Itll just put pressure on your belly and offers no back support when sitting . The ASP , goes on first , just puts pressure on your back . It almost didnt make any sense for it to go on first . Im so dissappointed .
 Okay , first the good news
 My baby was sitting low giving me extra stomach pain . The doctor suggested I try a maternity belt . After reading several reviews on different products , I chose this at $ 35 . I wish I did n't spend the money . It just did n't provide the relief I was looking for or that others experienced . I was also afraid to pull it tighter for fear of taking too much of the baby 's room . I had my doctor look at it and she said I seem to be wearing it correctly but it was n't providing what I needed .
 It took a long time to receive this product . The fragrance was not Lavender at all . I would not recommend this product to anyone .
 i love the smell of both coffee and chocolate , but this incense does n't smell like either or both . it does kinda smell a little like burned coffee , but no chocolate . i wo n't buy it again .
 This is more like a 2XL in runs huge . I will never be able to wear it for any kind of support .
 This breathalyzer will not work for anyone suffering from breathing problems like asthma , or COPD . There is no possible way to force enough air through it to get any kind of reading . This was a total waste of money . If you have any of these conditions choose something else .
 I bought this recently , and always had problems keeping the batteries in . I had to hold the cap on the whole time for it not to turn off . The sensor also lasted much less than 500 tests . I have had the monitor about 6 months and used it less than 100 times , and now it wonk work until I replace the sensor . It was a lot of money for poor quality , but it did seem to measure alcohol level consistently
 I have used this product after having three drinks . I waited twenty minutes and received a 000.00 rating on two occasions . I plan on sending it back .
 I purchased this device after reading about it being DOT approved for Law Enforcement , coast guard certified and yaddiyaddiyadda . When I unpacked it and installed the batteries I notice that the pivot point for the battery cover is about a 1/32 '' plastic tab . The battery cover latch was no better . After installing the batteries and snapped the cover shut , they promptly ejected out the bottom of it ... multiple times . This thing is made to the same standard as a carnival souvenir . In reading about the accuracy of the device in the manual provided it states `` Accuracy at a Blood Alcohol Concentration greater than 0.032 has not been evaluated '' The manual also states that a BAC level of 0.05 % and over could impair your ability to drive . People are trusting this device to insure that their driving may not be impaired although the manual confirms that this device is not a safe method to test your BAC in those ranges .
 I bought this unit because another reviewer said it gave consistent readings and was of good quality . Unfortunately , neither is the case with mine.Readings vary considerably from test to test , and a level of 0.000 has been returned more than once after a drink or two , so I have little confidence in its accuracy.Not only that , but it 's fashioned from flimsy plastic which does n't hold itself together well enough for the battery cover to stay on by itself . The `` CE '' logo looks fake , and the whole item feels very cheaply made indeed.Could be I just got unlucky . Either way , a waste of a hundred bucks .
 I bought this thing a few years ago and really did n't use it much . I just found it in a drawer and decided I should look up some reviews to see how many other people bought and hated it . Seriously , you 're throwing away over 100 bucks if you get the same piece of garbage I got . The first 20 times I used it , it seemed SOMEWHAT consistent ... . and I use that term loosely . As in I could have a few drinks and blow a .04 one time , then a few minutes later I might blow .07 and anywhere in between if I would keep trying . At some point I tried blowing into it without having ANY drinks and it would show .04 . I just fired it up now to see if it still worked and with no drinks I blew a .05 and had one drink , tried again and got two readings in a row of .4 , I mean legally dead kind of numbers . I know I know , it 's time to replace the sensor , but why bother if the thing was always inconsistent and all over the place from day one . My recommendation would be that if you really need an accurate meter , spend good money for a quality unit , or just do n't bother , because this one really is worthless . Be safe people.Ciao
 Without going into the unfortunate details let 's just say I was able to compare the readings on the Alcomate with a device that was certified for legal purposes and it was INACCURATE by up to 50 % !! -LRB- At least it tended to be off on the high side i.e. exaggerating your BAC but are you going to trust your legal liability to something that inaccurate ? -RRB- I would love to hear a response from the manufacturer and any independent testing of this device . Is there ANY warranty of accuracy for this device ? I think not , - and if there is - mine is defective and needs to be replaced . Do n't even think of risking your legal liability by relying on this until this is clarified.In response to Willis 's comments - no I did not get a DUI in reliance on this device . I would never trust it given my experience to give an accurate reading and neither should anyone else . Several other reviewers have corroborated its inaccuracy . If there 's an objective side-by-side comparison to a legally recognizedbreathalyzer let 's see it . Otherwise it 's just an over-priced toy .
 The picture clearly shows a bag of some sort that hold the breathalyzer and the pocket case . It appears to be a much larger fabric case . This case does not come with the order . It is being misrepresented !
 It feels cheap , the results are wildly inaccurate or simply do n't work . I just got done RMA'ing the second one . I have a $ 600 one I brought home from work that is calibrated on a monthly basis and is dead on accurate for comparison . A twister game spinner would be more accurate at detecting blood alcohol content . It is kind of scary when someone that you know is over 0.08 , and this product shows 0.00 % . A one star rating is one star too many .
 Stay far away from this product . The design of the head allows bactaria to stay in the brush head of the product ... that 's right ... the part you put in your mouth . Current owners can remove the brush head and see the black gunk that builds up under the brush head and into the upper handle part . Do yourself a favor , buy the SonicCare , or at least the better Oral B product that has a sealed head .
 The HeadBlade is a neat concept that just tries too hard to be innovative . I received one a few weeks ago , and committed to trying it -LRB- it seemed pretty cool , at first -RRB- , but it just does n't deliver the goods . It can do a passable job when you follow the directions and get used to using it , but I think that most of the 5-star ratings here are based on the novelty . My regular old disposable razor does a better job at keeping a close shave without second passes , and I always knew where the blade was landing when I brought it down on my scalp , as opposed to the HeadBlade , which put the wheels practically in my eye if I was shaving the hairline above my forehead . Sure , you can get used to it . I did . I still find a regular old razor to be a closer shave and easier to maneuver around the nooks and crannies around the ears . Of course , with the headblade you also have to have a regular old shaver for the rest of your face , which makes it seem rather pointless and redundant.The bottom line
 I 've been shaving my head `` traditionally '' for years , stumbled across this product on the internet and decided to give it try . Yes it does provide a less irritating shave , but i could do a better job with a boxcutter . Shaved exactly as the directions state and still had to go over many areas two to three times and still didnt get a close shave . In my opinion it 's not worth the price . Go buy a good 4 or 5 blade razor instead .
 New HeadBlade Sport - The Ultimate Head Shaving Razor!I did not find this item easy to use and it did not properly shave my head even as I replaced the blades . I tried holding it from several angles and moving it different ways across my head . Nothing worked . It got a few spots and left others with stubble or longer.I ended up discarding it and going back to my Trac II razor .
 This is the first blade that I have cut myself with in the past two decades , and I 'm not talking just a nick but a major peel the skin off cut ! Dulls quickly and the pushing motion required to use the headblade is totally unnatural . Mine is now in the trash . Do n't waste your money !!!
 I 've been using a Turbo Mach 3 for years , and came across this ... Being careful to follow the directions , I never could get a really good shave without repeated and repeated passes . It did work well to remove a chunk of skin a couple of times , though . In the end , I 'm back on the Turbo ... If you 're thinking of buying one , I 'll sell you mine !
 All show and no go - that 's the best description . It ' s just a gimmick . I used it for quite some time to try different techniques and different style blades . Each time it left parts of my head with long stubble , even after repeated swipes . This made for an extra long , extra unproductive shaving session.Then the blood ... When it cuts -LRB- which it does a lot , especially in the back -RRB- , it cuts deep - which tends to reopen the next time you shave . I finally had to take time off to heal before retrying this thing - with the same results.I 'm doing better with a medium quality dispoable blade , for a lot less money . If you still want one of these - I 'll sell you mine . It 's sitting in a drawer now ...
 I 've used the original headblade for years -LRB- once a month -RRB- and I 've been very happy with it . The stupid wheels on the tail end of this `` improved '' model reduce your directional control and , because of the vibration they produce , reduce the sensitivity you get from having the tips of your finger guiding the blade . You end up having to run the blade over several times to get it completely clean.With the original model , I rarely cut myself . I cut myself twice with this version . I tossed it in the trash halfway through the shave.They should fire the product engineers that decided it would be a good idea to make this thing . `` I know , people will buy it if it reminds them of a sports car . '' Is that really true ? I hope not .
 Am sure this product is legitimate and has some good uses , but was suggested for relief of shingles and was totally useless for that purpose so in essence the money spent for that purpose was wasted .
 I was eager to try this cleanse as I did my research , and was impressed with the reviews provided by other users . However , after only two days of taking the supplements , I have had constant headaches . These are not due to the lack of caffeine as I do not drink this stimulant on a normal basis . I have changed my diet to help with the cleansing process , but have n't noticed too much of a difference . Also , the pills from the third phase must have some sort of sleeping aid in them as ten minutes after I took it , I could not keep my eyes open . This sounds good in theory , but the idea of putting something in my system that forces me to go to sleep makes me a little nervous . Anyway , maybe you 'll have better luck with them than I did , as it seems other people have found them helpful .
 Better products available . This is nothing more than a big plastic bottle full of water .
 These vitamins contain herbs that cause loose stools . After taking them for two weeks , and looking up the herbal ingredients on www.fda.gov , I knew it was the herbs causing a type of bowel problem that I had never experienced before . I have normal bowel functioning now that I threw out the vitamins ! I happened to have my annual physical exam shortly after this and my internist confirmed my evaluation .
 the first time I used these I found the magnet did not stick to tapelike the old ones I used did . very disappointed . only good for oneuse , and that would be too costly for someone that uses them daily .
 I did not know until I received the product that it was a sports drink supplement , and the recommended measurements were n't like the ones I 've seen on the individual packages of Natural Calm . I 've only used it 3 times since I bought it , and it did n't make me feel as well as the original Natural Calm supplement made me feel . I will just stick with the original version from now on . The only thing I found good about this product was the taste . Other than that , it was of no use to me .
 My dog has had UTIs all her life . Every month -LRB- or so -RRB- she is afflicted with yet another one . I have tried diet changes , even to raw food , different water , distilled , bottled -LRB- Voss -RRB- , and finally this product . It was cheaper than the $ 112 Clavamox they usualy prescribe , but had to use SO much of it , and it is in such a small bottle for so much money . While using it , she got yet another infection . I thought I should continue using it , that I did n't give it a fair enough shot . I kept using it but it did n't do much to help . I was left with having to fall back on expensive drugs . :-LRB- So disappointed , but I am glad they offer a money back guarantee . Too much money anyhow .
 This is a waste of money . It is not pure neem oil . This smells like it only has a little neem oil in it , and the rest is just cheap sesame oil . If you want neem , buy the uncut neem oil and make your own blend to save money .
 This reacher may work , but I would n't know . It came in a 23 '' size instead of the 16 '' size I ordered and needed as it is for a ver short person and the 23 '' size is too long . Over a month ago , I was told it would be picked up by UPS and a new one shippped . So far , nothing . I called again 2 days ago , had to leave voice mail message . Still no response . So , I 'm out my money and do not have the product I need .
 I bought the Ultra-Lightweight Rainbow Reacher for my grandmother and she told me that it was hard to use . She stated that the grabber end barley opens and the suction cups do not pick up much of anything . Cosmetic Solutions is not a company I would buy from again . They never sent a shipment confirmation and Amazon had to cancel the order . I bought my grandmother a replacement grabber , the PikStik Pro Aluminum Reacher , from Amazon and my grandmother was very satisfied with this reacher . She stated that the PikStik Pro Aluminum Reacher was easier to grip and picked up all the smaller objects -LRB- such as the TV remote -RRB- that she need to reach .
 A friend recommended this magnetic bracelet because of relief they received for carpal tunnel . I wore it for about 2 months and have no relief . I also tried it to help with a bout of vertigo , but it did n't help with balance either.Be cautious of wearing them near watches , it drains the battery . I did not have success with this item .
 These bandages are poor quality . May be ok for one-time use , but I wanted to use them to wrap my lower legs . I am diabetic . They tear easily and have poor elasticity when stretched unless they are stretched very little . Half had tears just from the clips that came with them .
 You definitely wo n't get any from this item . I started to wrap one of these bandages on my leg and my finger went right through the bandage !! The edges started to fray as soon as I tightened the bandage . I tried more than more thinking maybe it was just one bad one in the bunch , but no luck.Don ' t waste your money on these .
 My doctor gave me Thorne Profusia-SR to improve my circulation and , though I felt good for about two hours after taking Profusia-SR , it began a series of scary nighttime heart and breathing episodes that nearly had me in the ER ! My pulse and O2 saturation were jumping all over the place . I had many palpitations and felt more weak and tired than ever ! Then when I stopped the Profusia-SR , the symptoms continued for another couple of nights . I will never take it again !! People with any prior heart issues beware !!
 I bought this mattress a week ago . I observed that the price is the most expensive brand in Amazon for similar items . I was hoping it 's better pad than other competitor.My opinion is it 's a total ripp-off . The mattress is so thin with very little magnetic on it .
 I purchased this set for my first child and only ended up using the nail clippers and the thermometer . The nasal aspirator did n't work as well as the one provided by the hospital . The medicine dropper and spoon were n't useful because most infant medications bottles have a dropper included . The thermometer worked well but too quickly ran out of battery and because the battery is n't replaceable in this model I have to buy a new one . The nail clippers work well and we still use them.From my experience , I would buy an infant nail clippers and a better quality thermometer that has a changeable battery and skip this set entirely .
 I am familiar with the product . It would be great if it had ever showed up . 5 weeks later still no product . The tracking is a joke . Amazon needs to do a better job screening its distributors .
 I like the product , if it ends up getting delivered . I ordered it over a month ago , and have never received the product .
 We 've had this memory foam mattress by All-Sleep since February of this year -LRB- 2009 -RRB- . By July it had begun to fail - 2 deep wallows where we sleep -LRB- 130 lbs and 200 lbs -RRB- . You have to go through a climbing exercise to have both of you cuddling in the middle of the bed . You have to clumb up and out of the bed in the morning.Really unacceptable after 6 to 9 months of use.Called All-Sleep -LRB- there website seems completely inoperative -RRB- about the 10-year warranty . Hard to find out anything . Appears that to replace the 4 '' Visco Elastic Memory Foam layer - the layer you sleep on - costs $ 25 to ship to them - $ 25 to ship back to us - $ 100 warranty proration charge for a total cost of $ 150 -LRB- plus packaging -RRB- to replace a $ 400 item that I 'm sure we want replaced !!!!! I think this company is deceptive at best and fraudulent at worst.Buyer BE WARE .
 I was introduced to this product while on vacation in Canada in 2006 . I have tried a lot of other products that claim to suppress the effects of acid-reflux . This truly works , I now enjoy peaceful nights ... try it , you will not be disappointed .
 This product was a big disappointment . It was too big and bulky for a the neck ; plus , the velcro strap kept getting caught on the fabric of the piece . I ended up burning a hole in it from microwaving it once after it got too cold from a previous microwave heating . The beads spilled out onto the microwave tray . Compared to a ` bed buddy ' made from rice pellets and shaped in a sausage type arrangement , a product I bought at Target years ago -LRB- it 's still working just fine -RRB- , this product , much more expensive , was a waste .
 My 8 year old daughter got head lice . `` No problem '' I thought . I 'll just go get some medicine to kill the lice and game over . After using this product exactly as described , twice , we discovered that her head lice are completely resistant , finding live lice every time we looked . Frustrated , I then started looking online and found that many lice in the US are resistant to the active ingredient in Nix and other over the counter `` pediculocides '' . The prescription strength medicines -LRB- Kwell , etc. -RRB- are potent neuro-toxins and I am not ready to coat my child 's scalp for hours in something that is known to cause seizures , paralysis , and death . We have now resorted to combing daily with a nit comb , hoping to get rid of the lice by attrition , and olive oilIt probably makes sense to try Nix once because it would surely be nice to have a one shot method to get rid of lice , but check carefully the next day for live lice since you probably wo n't be so lucky . If you find them , give up on the chemicals and start researching alternative ways -LRB- olive oil , etc -RRB- . And invest in a good , metal nit comb that you can boil to sanitize in between combings or between children . You 'll be needing it ... alot .
 There 's been a run on lice treatment in Wal-Mart so I only managed to get a couple of boxes of Nix as recommended by the pharmasist . The rest of the family had to make do with the Equate store brand.Despite carefully following all the Nix instructions there were still loads of live lice in the hair immediately after treatment . The store brand -LRB- much cheaper with more active ingredients -RRB- worked great and those heads were still nit free a week later.Treating a whole family for lice is very expensive so pick something that is going to work first time , and that is not Nix . Then comb , comb , comb and comb again , daily for at least 10 days .
 Yesterday , per our doctors recommendation , I used the Nix one treatment product on my 2 kids , husband and self for what I was told was a very mild case of lice infestation . I read the directions several times and followed them to the letter . Used baby shampoo to wash everyone 's hair , applied Nix to damp hair , rinsed Nix out after exactly 10 minutes , dried with clean towels , used individual nit combs and everyone put clean clothes on . We each wore clean shower caps after the treatment and spent hours washing and vacumming the house . This morning I showered and just wet my hair . Just before lunch I felt something move in my hair , I checked the kids and actually saw several ADULT lice . I think this stuff actually helped them multiply and mature ! Completely disappointed with the Nix product , $ 60 for 3 family packs down the drain.We are in the process of trying the Nuvo technique - cetaphil dried on the hair for 8 hours to smother the lice . Crossing my fingers this will work and cleaning the house again ...
 The handle is too flimsy to make this product useful to everyone . Those having trouble washing their legs could use this product , as well as those that want a very light pressure washing their back . All others would do well to select something else .
 This is comfortable to wear but it slips down very easily . Also , the steel springs do not offer much support nor protection to prevent injuring your knee joint .
 This brace provides fairly light support and compression . It provides more lateral support than just a knee `` sleeve '' -- but not substantially more . I would definitely not recommend it for anyone with significant knee weakness . By itself this would merit a 3 or 4 star rating . Unfortunately , on my third use of the brace the top portion tore . I can not tell if this is due to the relatively light material out of which it is constructed , a design flaw , or a flaw in the manufacturing process -LRB- or some combination of the three -RRB- . Given that the brace is tight -LRB- it must be to serve its function -RRB- , it should be built substantially enough to hold up to more than three pulls -LRB- which are required to put it on -RRB- . Not a horrible item , but there must be something better on the market .
 I purchased this item , and instead of receiving 100 condoms as the product description states , I received only 85 . I am hesitant to do business with this company again .
 I thought this would be a fun gift for a friend 's birthday . I expected the 100 condoms would come in some sort of cute box or package that described `` condoms from around the world '' etc. . I also ordered a box for myself . What I ended up getting was a plain white US Post Office box with some handfuls of condoms thrown in . -LRB- Possible 200 ? I have n't counted . -RRB- Certainly not a fun gift item I can give to a friend . I 've tried contacting CondomMan to return the items for a refund , and ten days later have still heard nothing back from them . Learn from my experience -- do n't waste your time with this vendor .
 BE CAREFUL !! Please do n't waste money to buy troubles . I got 28 pieces of CROWN brand and 72 pieces of BEYOND SEVEN brand in a bubbled envelop . Not a variety pack at all . There is no DUREX , no LIFESTYLES , no OKAMOTO as shown on the picture on Amazon web site . Those two brands are all made in Thailand and I have never heard before . I asked a return but the seller asked me to drop to the post office marked `` return to sender '' first . -LRB- They saved the postage for returning and did n't trust that I would return . -RRB- I asked the new shipment should be DUREX , LIFESTYLES , and OKAMOTO only . Unfortunately , I still got 12 pieces of CROWN brand and 24 pieces of BEYOND SEVEN brand . I drop these two unknown -LRB- may be fake -RRB- brands products -LRB- 36 pieces , i.e. 36 % -RRB- to trash can already . This is a very EXPENSIVE AND BAD experience from Amazon . This seller is totally not reliable and not trustworthy .
 I 'm not reviewing the condoms themselves , but the `` variety pack '' altogether.Like other reviewers say , I got a lot of Durex condoms . If you do n't like Durex then I do n't suggest buying this pack.I also received about 12 condoms that expired within 6 months after I purchased the pack , when the product description guarantees a minimum of 2 years .
 I placed an order for 100 condoms on there website over three weeks ago and have never heard anything back from them except that they charged my credit card . I tried calling the number on their website which is an invalid number . It took me some hunting to find an e-mail that works , I 'd be weary of doing business with them ever again .
 I would n't go for it since the quality is pretty low and the seller itself is pretty bad ... I have tried many condoms in my life , bought cheap to expensive , variety and challenge was my motto but these definitely are not worth your money ...
 I was not happy to see that all but maybe two were durex brand . I was n't aware that it would n't include more well known brands . Plus the durex brand are so small that he could n't even wear them ... so it was a complete waste of money . Wish I would have read the reviews before I purchased this .
 WARNING
 This so called thumb stabilizer is not even worth being called a glove . I do not believe it 's really leather , and it only has one very small splint . Why they charge so much for it is beyond me .
 These two trimmers are probably the cheapest pieces of trash I 've ever wasted money on . The little trimmer did n't work from arrival and the bikini trimmer died after 2 uses . DO N'T waste your money !
 This is listed as a Two Pack and 18 cents per unit . But only one box of 20 ships , for 35 cents per unit .
 The only reason this is n't one star is because the product works great . However , I accidentally bought the orange-scented product instead of the Quantum tablets that came with my Whirlpool dishwasher with no added scent . Those were perfect.Only after I got home with the orange-scented tablets from the grocery store had I noticed my mistake . I do n't normally like added scents in my household products , but I opened one of the individually-wrapped tablets cautiously , and was surprised at how good it smelled . I wanted to eat it . In fact , I raised it to my mouse like it was a giant orange piece of PEZ candy , so blinded by the delicious aroma that the only thing that stopped me from a trip to the emergency room for poisoning was my wife reminding me it was n't candy.I enviously popped the tablet into my dishwasher 's gullet instead of mine , while mentally running through all the stores nearby that might sell PEZ at this hour.About 5 - 10 minutes later , both my wife and I smelled something . We followed the stench to the kitchen . We thought it was the garbage , but the garbage did n't smell . I worried there was some old leak under the dishwasher or the refrigerator , finally emitting a rotting moldy smell - I checked under both appliances and luckily it was n't . Then I realized the offending smell was much like urine . I checked my pants . It was n't me . I asked my wife to check hers . She threw a dish at me . We do n't have kids , we do n't have pets . The only perp left was the dishwasher
 I got taken , like another reviewer at about the same time period . When I saw it , the item clearly stated it was a 2-pack for $ 7.00 and the per-tablet price was listed as $ 0.18 -LRB- i.e. , $ 7.00 for 40 tablets -RRB- . I compared every similar item on Amazon for the lowest unit price . My order even states `` 2x Electrasol PowerBall Tabs Plus Jet Dry ... '' Sold by
 I thought I 'd give these a try after the last time I ran out of the Cascade that I usually use . I had noticed that my sister was using these and I figured if they worked then I would n't have to keep getting the Jet Dry too . To try them out I just got the 20 count box and I 'm glad that 's all I wasted my money on!Now , I have one of the top of the line Sears Kenmore dishwashers that 's only 6 years old . When I got it it was the second most expensive one or the third , I cant remember for sure now , but any who , it was over $ 500 . So any who , what I 'm trying to say is that my dishwasher ai n't no old cheap underpowered thing that you have to wash the dishes before you put them in it . It has worked well with the Cascade Gel , a generic Orange scented Gel , and a couple of others that I cant remember . Being a bachelor and living alone I only run it about once a week at most and some times two weeks since the last time . Depends on how often I just use the paper plates . Any who , I thought with this being basically a powder pressed into a block once its broke down it would act like a slightly abrasive spray sorta like a liquid sandblaster to help get the dishes clean . But actually it does n't really do much of anything.My usual routine is to run a quick rinse after I load the dishwasher then check to make sure everything staid put and nothing got moved around , turned up so it will hold water , or got down and blocked one of the arms . After running a wash cycle with one of these Finish Powerball Tabs I could n't tell if I had ran the wash cycle or had only run the quick rinse cycle . And that was with a pretty small load of mostly bowls and glass 's . With a greasy frying pan and a glass baking dish I used for one of those box cheesy potato 's things and running it on the heavy duty pots and pans cycle it did n't even come close to getting the frying pan or the square glass baking dish clean . Even though the frying pan even has the no stick coating , and its a good one too ! Not one of those thin aluminum cheap ones that looses all the coating after the first few times its used and you throw it away within the first year . Any who , its one of the really good no stick frying pans that I 've had for about ten years . It looked like it had only gone through a quick rinse and not the longest strongest cycle the dishwasher has . Honestly , the only time that these Finish Poweball Tabs work , is if I also use some other dishwasher detergent with them . I 've been using this cheap stuff from WalMart in a orange jug called SUN Automatic Dishwashing Gel with Citrus scent . My dishes now come out nice and clean like they are supposed to ! So I just pretend that its adding the Finish Poweball Tabs to the cheap Gel that 's getting the job done and not the other way around because I really know that it does n't make any difference if I use the Finish Powerball tabs with the cheap gel stuff or not . But at least I 'm using them up and I guess its better than just throwing them away . Or I guess I could just give them to my sister . She has one of those 30 year old dishwashers that she has to wash the dishes before she puts them in it . Maybe that 's why she cant tell they do n't really do anything ? Any who , I can tell you one thing for sure , I 'm never going to waist any more of my money them again !
 This so called thumb stabilizer is not even worth being called a glove . I do not believe it 's really leather , and it only has one very small splint . Why they charge so much for it is beyond me .
 Does n't smell lemony , so 2 stars.Performs like a champ.This stuff lathers into whipped cream in under 5 seconds on my face.I use a 30 dollar badger brush soaked with hot water . Smells too soapy for my taste . Taylor 's Rose smells like rose so I love it . Taylor 's Avocado does n't smell like avocado , thank God . It smells like a field after it rains + lavender .
 I spoke to a seller about this at a craft fair . He maintained it was a great product and sure to not bother people 's lips.This product made my lips peel and hurt after one day of use . It was very uncomfortable and took about a week to heal.I contacted the company to let them know about the problem and recieved no response .
 I 'm a hard gainer and I have n't gained a pound since starting to use this product over 2 weeks ago . Taste is ok , but powder does n't mix well at all . Practically have to chew the shake before I can swallow it !
 I bought four of these handles and with minimal use two bulbs blew out and they cost $ 25 each . The handle is actually quite good for the price and it 's slightly brighter than my similar Heine -LRB- F-22 .804 -RRB- handles but I could never recommend this Welch Allyn handle because the bulbs do n't last . The Heine bulbs last forever . I called Welch Allyn to discuss this and got no response .
 Eagerly awaited this product . It was a huge disappointment because it popped and was unusable after 5 uses . I spent the extra money to get a good quality device .
 I would rank them with negative stars if I could !!! I purchased this item from Allegro Enterprises Inc. and when it did n't arrive for several weeks , I purchased something else . Then , when it finally showed up , I tried to return it unopened but they refused ! There does n't appear to be one place on the website that indicates that they do n't except returns . Their own staff members could n't find the location where they state that this is n't returnable . I would n't buy anything from a company that appears to be so shoddy in its business practices !!!
 Never got the product ... it was to arrive on the 12th ... so I called on the 12th and it was a great experience . A real person answered the phone after 2 rings and refunded my money immediately also sent a voucher -LRB- $ 20 . -RRB- toward future purchase and a free shipping label in the event that the product came and needed to be returned . The Seller was Discount Vitamins . They understand the meaning of CUSTOMER SERVICE !
 Take any positive reviews of this product with a huge grain of salt!It 's amazing that people are suckered into buying this product . The active ingredients listed on the package are `` Anas Barbariae Hepatis Et Cordis Extractum 200 CK HPUS '' For most folks unfamiliar with Latin , that sounds like it 's got ta be some miracle drug , right ? Here 's the true story.Since 1925 , Oscillococcinum has been prepared as follows . Into a one litre bottle , a mixture of pancreatic juice and glucose is poured . Next a Barbary duck -LRB- that 's the `` Anas Barbariae '' -RRB- is decapitated and 35 grams of its liver and 15 grams of its heart are put into the bottle -LRB- that 's the `` Hepatis Et Cordis '' -RRB- . After 40 days in the sterile bottle , liver and heart disintegrate into a kind of goo , which is then diluted with water into the entire world production of Oscillococcinum for the year.There 's no logical reason to believe that anything in duck liver or heart will be an effective flu remedy . But even if there were some magic substance , the manufacturing process guarantees that it will not be in the finished product . The laws of chemistry indicate that after the 12th dilution , it is unlikely that a single molecule from the original organs will remain . Moreover , at the dilutions that Boiron indicates on their packaging -LRB- that 's the `` 200 CK HPUS '' part -RRB- the concentration of the original substance would be 1 part in 100 ^ 200 , which is a 1 followed by 400 zeroes . A 1 followed by 100 zeroes is called a googol . The estimated number of particles in the universe that we can see is a googol , give or take a few zeroes . So in order for one of the original duck molecules to be present in a container of Oscillococcinum , the mass of that container would have to be about a googol googol googol times our world , which would be incomprehensibly larger than the visible universe.A little research is all it takes to discover that there is n't a SINGLE reputable scientific study demonstrating the efficacy of this product . And even assuming that the `` active ingredients '' -LRB- duck heart and liver -RRB- have any effect on the flu , remember that by spending your $ 16 on a container of goose liver pate and crackers , you 'll be getting a dose of duck organs that 's billions of times stronger than what goes into this so-called `` drug '' . All things considered , your money is better invested in a flu shot BEFORE flu season starts .
 Our family doctor told me that a bottle of whisky is a better flu remedy than any of this homeopathic mumbo-jumbo . He recommended a yearly flu shot as the best preventative . At least a flu shot has some science behind it ...
 I took a whole box of this with no noticeable results . I followed the directions and took it every 6 hours and started on the 1st day of symptoms . No luck . Will not buy again .
 My dad insisted that I take this the last time I got a cold -LRB- and I did take it , with no noticeable effect -RRB- , so I did a little research , and found out what this is . They use pseudo-scientific jargon to disguise the fact that this is quite literally a sugar pill . The active ingredient is `` Anas barbariae hepatis et cordis extractum HPUS 200CK '' . `` Anas barbariae hepatis et cordis '' is Latin for duck heart and liver , HPUS is the acronym for a reference book that defines the ingredient . But do n't worry about consuming duck organs , the `` 200ck '' describes the method of preparation . They puree the duck parts in water . Then they actually completely empty out the bottle and refill it with pure water , and whatever is stuck to the side of the container is then presumably absorbed into the new water , thus quickly and drastically diluting the solution . And then they repeat this process ... 200 times ! They take the final `` solution '' -LRB- pure water -RRB- and put it on little balls of sugar . Statistically it would be like winning the lottery if even one molecule of duck was in your dose of sugar . Basically they could be using the heart and liver from the same duck for every dose they make until the sun explodes and they would have plenty left over . True , if you take this medicine your cold should be better in a few days . However , if you do n't take this medicine guess what ? Your cold should be better in a few days . These people are immoral crooks , and France out to be ashamed that they have n't put this company out of business.I am sorry for the negative review , it just makes me very upset to see such a deliberate , organized , long-lasting scam that has been accepted by so many . There is no cure for the common cold yet , just stick to medicines which help your symptoms , and if it makes you feel better to take this , go ahead , it wo n't hurt you , it is probably the safest medicine on the market .
 All this proves is the power of the placebo effect -LSB- which is very strong in certain people -RSB- . A recent -LSB- Cochrane Library -RSB- medical meta-analysis of all the `` trials '' showed an overall effect of 0.2-days of relief ! The reason you feel crummy with flu is because it takes that long to generate the antibodies to clear the virus from your blood , and to generate CD8 T cells -LSB- white blood cells -RSB- to knock off infected cells tricked into producing the virus.This product -LSB- which is just powdered sugar -RSB- claims to be produced from duck liver which is `` a natural reservoir of influenza viruses '' . This is not true ; viruses tend to be species-specific and this is certainly true for human influenza viruses . An extract is then diluted out a gazillion times , but this leaves an `` imprint '' . An imprint of what ? The influenza virus ? Why does n't the product then itself give us the flu ? How does our immune response make a response to a ghost ? My hearty congratulations to the French charlatans who stick sugar in a bottle and sell it for over 10 bucks at a time .
 I own a cross pen made in usa . The pen is heavy , very well made and gorgeous . I just recieved this pen thinking the reviews were just being over dramatic however , the pen really does feel like cheap tin . I have requested a refund immediately . For 75 $ the pen should be flawless and it just isnt .
 Bought 4 cross sterling silver pens as gifts . $ 75 or so each . Did not think I had to inspect them , beyond looking quickly in the box . Gave them as gifts , and all of them exhibited tarnish at top and or bottom . To late to return . First really bad experience with amazon . Should have bought crome for $ 20 each .
 Not what I expected at all from a Cross pen . It arrived as if it had been burned , perhaps rust , I am not sure . Black spots all over and body is a little yellow . I am returning it for a new one . I hope it comes alright this time . Very dissapointing !
 I bought this after reading the other 4 reviews that gave this pen 5 stars!The build quality is so china like , the upper and lower peaces of the pen are not aligned like it should . . you can never expect such horrible problem with such a highly priced product . . Other than that it writes smoothly and came with a nice gift box . .
 Did not like the smell at all !!!!! Problem I was having cleared up before having a real chance to use it .
 Do n't know what 's in this product , and maybe it 's the honeysuckle , I do n't know , but this product produces a red rash ring around my armpits . I am allergic to the lemongrass brand of Tom of Maine 's as well.I 've used various brands of Tom of Maine 's for a long time , and -- now , I 'm developing allergies ? This is ridiculous but true . I have had no trouble with the calendula scent so I 'll probably stop trying out new scents .
 I love tom 's , but this does n't work for me . I 'm searching for a aluminum/paraben free deodorant that actually works for me .
 Really did n't work for me , by the end of the day I was pretty smelly and thats just sitting at a desk typing all day . And I do NOT have a problem with odor control . I think this is the first time I have ever put on deodorant and in less than 24 hours started to smell like BO.The scent to me is pretty mild , not like vicks , not like anything much really . But I can tell you what smelt strong , my pits after a day with this deodorant . Ewww.If the trade off is to be all natural and stinky , or full of chemicals and smell great I take smelling great.Too bad I bought two sticks at once :-LRB- .
 Even though this item is n't alot of money initially , once you pay shipping , the product is n't worth the cost . The two pieces of the `` adjustable '' pole wo n't go together properly , so it 's not only not adjustable - it wo n't stand up straight . The set screws that fasten the top and bottom onto the poles are microscopic . I guarantee no one has a phillips screwdriver that small , but even then , the screws are too large for the holes provided ! I would have sent it back , but did n't want to invest even more . Skip this one !
 I wanted a hair dryer stand that would hold my hair dryer up level with my head and leave both my hands free for styling . Unfortunately , this stand was not the right choice . If you want to sit down while you are drying your hair and you have a hair dryer that weighs next to nothing , you may be able to work with this.I use a Conair dryer that is not that heavy , but the flexible neck on this stand is weak and wo n't hold the dryer up . The stand itself has to sit on a chair or table if you want the hair dryer level with your head . The pole keeps coming out of the base anytime you move it . I 'm sure there is something better out there . Just keep looking .
 When using this product , you might get a headache . When i used it , it did n't agree with me . So make sure you do a little research on it before you buy it .
 I 'd found that I was n't producing enough acid after years of great difficulty in digesting food . I was falling more and more sick despite being in my late twenties . After finding another product in a smaller , cheaper bottle for a test run I was astonished at the terrific results . I was far more energetic and even my skin improved . With this in mind I sought out a larger bottle and went for this . However , despite this product having nearly double both the Betaine and Pepsin , I was finding that in order to reach the same result that I was having to take four times the pills . Which , in this iteration are far larger than the ones I 'd taken before . In going over another 's review , I found a man that was a scientist that had done a chemical analysis of this product to find it contains a large amount of calcium carbonate as a binder -LRB- most likely the ` milk ' mentioned in the ingredients -RRB- . Which , is the primary ingredient in Tums acid reducer tablets . That 's right . This product counteracts its own self . Which explains my having had to take so many tablets compared to before . Having found a similar product from Vital Nutrients that also contains Gentian . An effective bitter that could aid in Bile production . Considering that the price paid is only a tiny bit higher , I 'm thinking that the fact it does n't contain any reactive ingredients as this one does that I 'll be taking quite a lot fewer of them . Saving money over time.Avoid this one and go for something else NOT containing calcium -LRB- milk -RRB- and you should be happy.For the review
 1st Of all when this bracelet arrived the case was jammed shut as if someone stepped on the box before sending it out for delivery . I literally hurt myself trying to pry it open . a couple of tools later I was taken back by the cheesy bronzy gold look . The bracelet looked extremely cheap . After I got over that I decided to try it on . Errrrr ! Not so fast the clasp would not open . Thankfully I had tools so I finally got it on . I was gon na try to work with it . Then time came to take it off . I had to enlist my husband and he struggled to pry the clasp open for me . Enough was enough , I had to send it back .
 The list of ingredients is wrong . They are advertising : Glucosamine Sulfate at 1.5 g but bottle lists 500mg . Chondroitin Sulfate at 1.2 g but bottle lists 400mg . Essential Fatty Acids at 10mg but bottle lists 10IU . This is not getting what you thought you were paying for .
 I really like the product but I can get the pills here in town . I sent for them on line because of the package . I like the seperate tubes that the pills come in . The pills they sent were in a bottle . This was a waste of time .
 It 's perfumed . Every time I mix a spoonful of this in a small bit of water to drink , it tastes like I 'm eating ladies perfume ! Yuk .
 This is a VERY poorly made reflex hammer . Do not purchase it !
 KY Warming liquid does what it promises , it moderately warms up on contact with skin . However , what the manufacturers do n't warn you is that it contains Honey . This makes it somewhat sweet tasting , but not good for women 's very sensitive areas . Anything sugary can wreak havoc on the delicate chemical balance of the vagina . This can even lead to infections , so beware ! It also gets quite sticky after prolonged use , so overall I give this product only 2 stars .
 My boyfriend surprised me with this lubricant for my birthday and it was nothing but a big disappointment . After 10 minutes there was still no warming sensation and I was left sticky and completely turned off . It was basically a waste of time and money .
 this stuff does not lubricate very well or warm up at all , my girlfriend and I kept waiting for it to warm up or do anything other than make our skin shinyThis review may only legally be shown directly on Amazon.com
 Watch out if your `` man '' has a little `` burning '' rash on his thing ... thinking YOU gave him something ... then it dawned on us ... it was that stuff !! Warms , but really does n't lubricate much .
 This is the most awful lubricant I have ever used . I have even received complaints including `` itching '' the next day - must be the honey!Anyway , stay away from this stuff unless you want to move your love making activities from two people to one .
 I have been using this product for three months now and I do n't see any results . The bottle does not last long being it contains 60 pills and you have to drink 8 pills a day . This is ridicules we are all better off using Nuro - PS Gold by vitamin world . The only reason I tried focus factor was because I did not have enough money to purchase the bottle from vitamin world at 50.00 dollars a bottle . I highly recommend those instead . I will never buy focus factor again .
 I did not like it much as it seems to interfere with my sleep . I just tried to take 1 pill in morning and even then it keeps me awake . Not sure how any one takes recommended 4 doses .
 This product is really good , but I 'm not reviewing about the product . When I ordered this product , I bought it in pack of 2 bottles . Result ? I got only 1 bottle instead of 2 . This is a scam . Watch out .
 I bought this today from my local CVS . I took one pill this morning with breakfast -LRB- I 'm only 94lbs , so the huge doses scared me -RRB- . After a few minutes I started to feel anxious , like I had too much coffee . I could n't sit through Church or focus on what the preacher was talking about . I 've had a dull headache around my temple area , and a ton of pressure behind my eyes all day . I will give it a few more tries , but I do n't think it helped me focus at all , if anything , the side effects made my focus worse than normal .
 I only took the product for 3 days and at half dose . If taken first thing in the morning , it kept me up an extra hour later than usual but ot caused me to have unrest-full sleep in the early morning . Maybe that goes away after a while . But from my experience these things are cumulative . It did help me `` focus '' , but then so does a cup of coffee ! Finding something for focus , that does n't interfere with my sleep , continues to elude me .
 Is it normal for the flints to break off a small piece after only 4 or 5 weeks of use ? This is my first Zippo and in under three months I have gone through replacing three flints . I am the only user and light it about 20 times a day . If this is not normal flint usuage I will be sending it back for replair . Also the wheel will be working just fine and then it will bind up .
 My search for a lighter included the terms butane and refillable . And this lighter 's description included this phrase
 i bought htis gift for my boyfriend for valentine 's day and it was horrible ! it didnt even work and was strached up compeltley ! DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT !
 this product is very bad and the quality is also bad . it Looks a little small flaws . i really do n't like it .
 when i got it i was so excited then i found out i had to buy feul it still wouldnt satrt now i realized the flint didnt come with it ... false advertisment 1 star : O
 Disappointed that Amazon would sell an aid to cancer . What relly bothers me is that you smokers will ultimately come down with a smoking related disease and expect us to pay for it . Keep on smoking ... it helps with overpopulation .
 it worked for about a week then it broke i replaced wick filled it but the flint wheel would not make any sparks
 Its always fun to own a Zippo . I am not sure though that the description `` uses butane fuel '' is accurate . Its not airtight enough . Flares up ! Its neat , cause it burns much too quickly to cause serious injury -LRB- although it most definitely could -RRB- . I 'm new to these lighters , so I am not sure if what I am doing something wrong -LRB- overfilling , for instance -RRB- , but after flaring up , the wick stops lighting up even though the flint creates a spark .
 I like how the lighter looks and all , but I was disappointed when I recieved the item , because it would n't light . The flit works just fine , it just would n't create a flame .
 Many scratches on the product . Looks like it has been thrown around -LRB- not just used - and this is a brand new piece -RRB- . Maybe a display piece - ca n't be too sure . Its just too low a price for me to bother sending it back . Not happy . Not what one associates with the Zippo brand .
 I 've bought two of these and the both quit working after a couple months . They eat through the fluid and need refilled constantly . Terrible product .
 I really liked this lighter because it did n't go out when it was windy but I only used it a couple times and now it wo n't spark at all it 's probably the flint but it seems like too much of a hassle to use this lighter ill stick with the cheap plastic ones
 I got this hoping it would be good . I only used it 3 times and it just stopped working and I do n't know what to do .
 The lighter seems to be loosing it 's lighter fluid . When I fill the lighter with name brand zippo lighter fluid it works wonderfully the first couple of days , then a week later all the fluid has dissipated . When I fill it again , completely saturating the cotton reservoir and the same thing happen , with only 3 or 4 uses it runs out of fluid . I 've tried under and over filling it and have done this a few times with no sustainable luck . The only thing I can think of is that this is a factory defect and it 's leaking . BTW I have plenty of zippos that work just fine . I do n't leave it in a car on a hot day . It is stored safely in my room . Guess I just got a bad one .
 I have bought many of these lighter this summer as a gift to my friends . I did not open it because it was taped and I do not want to open it as a gift . However several friends told me that the lighter seems like opened before and a lot of notches in the surface . Also the lid is not very stable and very loose . I am very disappointed about it .
 I do n't assume this is unique to zippo lighters , but the fluid evaporates extremely quickly if you do n't use it . If you 're not going to be carrying this around in your pocket , get a 99 cent bic lighter . If you are going to be carrying a lighter around then it 's still easier to just buy disposable lighters .
 I 'm not a smoker , so I bought the Zippo lighter for outdoor camping-type situations . The good news
 * Does n't work out of box * This is a good quality product with a great guarantee behind it ; however , no where on the description does it say you need to buy the fluid separate . The lighter comes with no fluid with it nor do they tell you to buy it with the lighter which makes it frustrating when you receive it then ca n't light it . So overall i like the product just do n't forget to buy the fluid
 I got a display zippo ... covered in scratches from top to bottom front and back . 1 star gone.This of course means the lighter didnt click as sharply as a new one should , which made was another star deduction.Lastly it was not advertised to be a display zippo , it was displayed to be NEW . As a result of false advertisement , another star.If the company would give me back my 10 $ and pay for shipping i would return it.Sadly thats not the case .
 I bought this one a month ago . I did n't expect it was a great lighter due to the cheap price . It turned out to be even worse and the parts did not even fit well .
 So , I did not find out the lighter fluid was sold seperately until I had received it . Extremely disappointing and dumb , this is a rip off .
 Not even a `` GENTLE warming sensation '' ; the warmth is absent completely ! Not only does it not even get warm , but it comes in this teeny tiny bottle about as big as your thumb !!! DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!! K-Y is usually a trusted brand but this does n't do what the name CLEARLY states it does . What DOES work
 This was more of a thick lotion that does not absorb well into the skin . I needed pain relief and this did not even help sore muscles .
 This product was completely liquid and oily when it arrived -- rather than in the form it should have been which is a cream like consistency to smooth on face . It was unusable .
 Disappointed . Have used Lancome powder gel for shine control for years , but it is n't always available . The Neutrogena product does not control shine , in fact it puts on a somewhat greasy layer on your face .
 I purchased this because it stated a long lasting shine . What a HUGE mistake . The only time I saw a shine was when it was wet and then it dried to a matte finish . Now I have to strip my floor because it is actual wax and now wo n't take any other product . Thank goodness I noticed the dull finish before I did more than my hallway . Down the drain with this junk .
 Instead of sending dead flowers , give your ex a can of this stuff . J & J is doing Canadian consumers a favor by withholding this product from the market . Hoping I was getting a worthy successor to the Johnson 's Beautiflor my mother used , I ordered a bottle of this stuff from the States . It is easy to apply and dries to a brilliant shine . But here 's the rub -LRB- ha ha -RRB- . As soon as I shifted some furniture on it , it scuffed . Unlike paste wax or Beautiflor you ca n't buff it back up . The dog leaves scratch marks all over it . I am waiting for spring in order to remove the mess with mineral spirits -LRB- the solvent -RRB- .
 I recently purchased this item for my mother . It is an adequate height to provide additional comfort and convenience . The inner circumference of this seat extends deep enough into the toilet bowl that there does not appear to be any likelihood of waste splashing or leaking over the rim . However , the most important aspect which needs to be considered with these seats is safety and stability . None of the similar units I looked at securely lock to the existing toilet . It would seem to me that a design which allowed for bolting the raised seat to the toilet through the standard seat hinge holes would be far more secure . The design of the so-called locking mechanism on this Carex seat is a very narrow ridge at the back which fits under the interior rim of the toilet and , in the front , a narrow sliding clamp with a soft plastic face which presses against the inner surface of the rim . The front clamp is on a threaded plastic rod with a tightening knob on the front of the seat . These provide some friction , at best -LRB- consider that the interface is plastic on ceramic -RRB- , and can be dislodged with very little pressure . When getting on or off the toilet , if uneven weight is placed on any portion of the rim , it is very likely the unit will tip , creating a significant fall risk . The addition of the arms magnifies the hazard , as they provide additional leverage . I would strongly suggest that for safety one of the external frame units with a commode seat would be far more appropriate . -LRB- Note that this is an edited and much more negative revision of my original review of this item , based on more experience in use . Also , note that if the patient has a documented medical condition affecting their stability , Medicare may pay for an external frame unit . -RRB-
 I ordered this product and a similar product from a non Amazon source . The other one arrived 3 days ago an this one has not arrived yet .
 These are so strong with throat numbing ingredients that all the other benefits are quickly overlooked . Hey , oral surgeons
 Not the fault of seller . I previously ordered USNEA -LRB- barbata -RRB- and I did not know the difference to Usnea -LRB- Uva Ursi -RRB- . I was looking for a larger oz quantity not found with previous brand . Barbata had no taste and did help with congestion issues.If you can get past the taste of dirty dirt it might be a good buy for 4oz 's of product .
 Be Aware !! The add shows them to be OLD !! Out of Date !! The add shows them to have expired back in 2011 . Shelf life long gone.Thanks to the guy that mentioned the low cost alternative
 These batteries had an unacceptably short life in my hearing aid remote control . They were either defective or so old that they had lost much of their charge . I will not purchase from this vendor again !
 A low cost alternative is to remove the casing from an alkaline 9 volt battery , which has 6 AAAA batteries inside !
 My device uses three at a time . The first three lasted for only a couple of minutes . I swapped out the batteries for the remaining three . Same thing . I then checked the expiration date stamped on the batteries . it was `` 0911 '' these batteries expired nine months ago .
 Only one gripe but it seems to be making itself more and more apparent to me . The batteries rattle around inside the body of the Stylus and the feel completely changes . I had been using Radio Shack batteries prior and never even thought about fitment because it was never a problem . Wo n't be purchasing these again . I plan on keeping the remaining three as a backup set .
 One of the big problems with the black cherry bars are the almonds which have exposed meat in processing . The exposed portion of the nut goes rancid , even when fresh . YUCK ! Skip this variety , unless you like that strong rancid taste .
 All it seems to do is vibrate . It 's pretty , the material feels nice ; it just does n't do anything other than vibrate .
 Perhaps , I got a neck pillow that was a lemon and the rest are all wonderful - but this is n't about the batteries or the vibrating it 's about the fact that the neck opening is not big enough to keep the pillow on my neck . I know my head sprouts directly out of my shoulders , but I ca n't imagine that it 's supposed to be that small . Anyhow , if your neck is not of the slender swan-like variety , this pillow is not for you . It is nice and squishy , though .
 This pillow is not as comfortable as it sounds . Yes it is soft , but as far as the massage goes , it vibrates on only one side of the pillow and you will find yourself very often laying on the mechanism which is extremely uncomfortable . I highly recommend seeking a different product .
 it is very small and it just have one little piece that vibrates in the back so it just rest on you neck and nothing else . i am sorry i purchased this item
 It 's interesting how the previous comments written regarding the fire this pillow started in my home just disappear from this site . There was NO ARCHING FROM ANY ELECTRICAL WIRING in my home , that is always the preliminary statement placed on fire reports on scene because it is the most common , 5 electricians have deemed the electrical arching not the cause of the fire , HOMEDICS never tried reaching me , THE USPSC LAUNCHED THEIR OWN -LRB- on going -RRB- INVESTIGATION OF THE PILLOW , I saw the pillow sitting on my sofa ON FIRE with my own eyes , furthermore , HOMEDICS NEVER REPORTED THE FIRE TO THE USPSC -LRB- Product Safety Commission -RRB- WITHIN THE REQUIRED BY LAW 72 HOURS AFTER IT WAS REPORTED TO THEM . How does Homedics explain that one away when it 's a product safety law that carries heavy sanctions when it is not reported to them within the 72 hours ? Was there some reason it was n't reported as required ? As a matter of fact when I did call HOMEDICS , their response to me was `` So what do you want from us '' . It 's not about `` wanting '' , it 's about safety when these pillows make great gifts for elderly people . Unfortunately HOMEDICS did n't think it was important enough to investigate and immediately placed this spin campaign on the situation , but the US PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION found importance in the matter . I 'm not saying Homedics is a horrible company and you should n't buy their products , I 'm only stating that on August 17th 2005 my smoke detectors went off and when I went into my living room `` flames were shooting up from the Squush neck massager pillow '' that was sitting on my sofa and my house was destroyed , not to mention myself being injured and it almost killing my dogs . How does Homedics explain the `` electrical outlet behind the sofa '' -LRB- they claim arched -RRB- still being intact and unburned and not even melted ? This is a review site , and that is my review ! Anyone can draw their own conclusions and use the pillow at their own risk ! My purpose is not to slam Homedics in this review , I just think people have the honest right to know what happened with the pillow at my home !
 I love Homedics , I own the Quad Roller 400 -LRB- which is amazing btw -RRB- , but thats another review , that being said , I was really looking forward to an awesome neck massage from this company . Three things annoyed me so much that I returned it to Amazon .1 . The material snagged when I took it out of the box . THAT wo n't work at my house . I shouldnt have to treat it like a pair of silk pantyhose to keep it looking nice . Its a pillow ! 2 . It is way to thick for my tastes , my earlobes were touching the pillow , and the buzzing noise was most annoying as well . It should be thinner and more adjustable like a bean bag .3 . The vibration itself was lame and I could n't get the vibrator situated to the side of my neck without turning the thing every which way , then , when I did get it there , my chin was way up in the air because the pillow is so thick.So , as you can tell , I can not recommend this product . Although , Homedics , if youre reading this , contact me , I have a great idea for soothing that area of the body : -RRB-
 I have also had the neck surgery with fusion , and bought this in order to relax the muscles and help get rid of the pain in my neck . I found it to be too noisy and the vibrating really irritated my eyes . It feels that it is under filled and does n't give much support other than the round hard vibrator inside .
 This is a product that I was hoping would help my neck pain . It is bulky and fairly worthless .
 My son just pulls off the splash guard and wont stay on the chair . I hate the way the seat comes off and it does n't slip back in well . My son just wants to take it apart all the time anyway and tries to sit on it without the seat . The high five thing does n't really help and he just bumps it with is leg anyway . My son just likes the fact that it 's elmo but he does n't sit on it .
 This product seemed great at first but has become very disappointing , the tabs attached to the seat part have bent after very little use and can not be bent back into place making it a struggle to place and remove , you just hope you do n't get splashed when trying to remove it . I am currently pregnant and it is very uncomfortable dealing with this , I need a potty that will allow me to easily lift the part I need to clean up . I am ready to buy a different one .
 If you want to spend your time wrestling to pull a potty apart and again to put it together this is the potty for you . This definitely was NOT designed with ease in mind . It takes longer for me to put it back together than for my son to use it . Hate it . Need to buy one with and easy slide out bowl .
 I bought this ages ago and while my son liked it at first , it is a disaster now that we 're trying to get him TRULY potty-trained -LRB- ie completely independent , pees on his own , dumps pee into big potty , reassembles potty , flushes , washes hands -RRB- . It has a weird design where you have to take off the outer layer to remove the bowl part , and then to put the outer layer back on is like assembling a puzzle . It 's hard even for me to take apart and put back together.The high five hand is , as another reviewer said , in a bad spot . My son bumps into it accidentally which makes the whole thing seem absurd . He 's sitting there , not peeing or pooping but hoping to , and Elmo 's shrieking `` Way to go ! CONGRATULATIONS ! '' And now the batteries are starting to wear out , which leads to bizarre middle-of-the-night episodes where Elmo suddenly starts talking on his own . Creepy.I am trading it in for one of the simple models with a bowl you can easily lift out and empty , and no bells and whistles . What 's the point of being able to turn into into a -LRB- very low -RRB- stool later , when by the time he 's not using it as a potty any more you certainly will have needed to buy stools for every sink in the house anyway ?
 There are two Major design flaws that make this potty a disaster . The first problem is Elmo 's hand . The toddler is supposed to high five Elmo to get `` encouraging phrases '' . Unfortunately , Elmo 's hand is right where my son 's leg hits . As soon as he sits on the potty , it starts shreiking and does n't shut up . This even annoys my Elmo loving son enough to keep him from sitting on it for more than a few seconds . The next problem is that the pee deflector just pops off . Any toddler can , and will , pop it off instantly . We had to run out to get a different potty right away . Leo loves Elmo but this potty is truly useless.al mom to leo
 This potty does the job , and my son likes it , but it has the following shortcomings :1 - The bottom of the receptacle is high enough that if a big poopy occurs , it touches your kids bottom , meaning more to wipe later on .2 - It 's easy to take apart , but awkward to clean , and there are bits that get bent when re-assembling , that if bent once all further reassemblies become annoying .3 - The electronics do n't like water , so it 's awkward to clean without ruining them . To make matters worse , if you have a boy that sometimes misses -LRB- even when sitting down -RRB- , the miss tends to go right onto Elmo 's hand , which is the button that you press to make Elmo talk , and is the thing that does not like moisture when you wash it.So , if your kid is a Sesame Street fan , go ahead and get this , but otherwise I would look for something more practical .
 My niece has this potty & I tried to get my son to use it while we were visiting on vacation . We were there 5 days & I could n't get him to use it even once -LRB- although he has no problem using other pottys -RRB- . While it certainly is cute , there are several major design flaws
 I grab a Clif Bar on my way to work every morning . As such , I tend to choose more fruit based bars and not the chocolate ones . -LRB- Black Cherry Almond is still the best flavor -RRB- When I first saw the Banana Bread flavor , I thought it would be a perfect day-starter flavor , especially as someone who likes banana bread . Unfortunately , they taste like they were made from rotten bananas . There was something not quite right about the banana flavor . I 'd send them back to kitchen to tweak the formula .
 As a public service to all you guys using electric shavers - I 've had many , and this was by far the worst . I bought the shaver new about 2 months ago and it is now dead . Here 's my experience :1 . Although the shave is comfortable and never pulled hair out , it plain missed whiskers sticking straight out . Even multiple passes to the same area ... uncanny that it would not cut some whiskers or take 10 passes to cut some . The hairs it would miss were plentiful . Requiring much more time to get a good shave .2 . After the cutting head lid was openned to clean it out , and then closed , 80 % of the time the shaver would not power on . It turned out that the cause of this was the 3 motorized stubs which engage with the cutting blades to spin them , were somehow binding up , so if you manually moved them the shaver would start up . This process went on 80 % of the times I went to use it . Finally , the shaver would not start up at all no matter what I did .3 . The trimmer is terribly designed , small , and would be more at home on a toy shaver.A huge dissappointment .
 The instructions advise you to wait until the batteries are almost depleted before charging -LRB- to preserve battery life -RRB- . That 's fine , except for the fact that there is no battery gauge . Are you supposed to wait until the shaver stops and then wait 6 minutes for a quick charge ? Poor design and poor shave to boot .
 I sent this to Norelco and asked that it be passed on to the engineering and marketing people who created this product.I hate this razor ! I used to have a 5814XL that finally died . It was one of many Norelco razors that I have had for over 35 years . When I needed to replace the 5814XL , I bought the 8825XL and after using it for 7 months , have come to despise its ability to provide a close shave . Here are my comments on that deficiency as well as others :1 . Even right out of the box , this shaver did not provide as close a shave as the old 5814XL .2 . I suspect that in order to make it easy to clean , the cutting mechanism was modified to emphasize chopping the hairs up very finely . In fact , I observe that the debris is indeed smaller than in the 5814XL . Unfortunately it is so small that it falls out of the holes in the cutter heads thereby making a mess in the bathroom . I think this may have compromised the ability of the 8825XL to shave close .3 . The removal of the AC-DC converter from the shaver body to the cord is a mistake .4 . The cord becomes unwieldy to store especially in the pouch . The converter plug is so heavy , it falls out of any socket that is a bit loose . This is especially a problem when shaving with the cord attached .5 . The cord with its huge plug does not coil well . The presence of the plug prevents the cord from being curled into any sort of small ball . In fact , the stiffness and direction of the exit of the cord from the plug prevents the cord from being even closely wound around the plug . This means that the cord and plug have effectively become twice as large .6 . Presumably the point of removing the AC-DC converter to the plug was to reduce the size of the shaver body . This was probably due to some styling guys wanting a `` sexy '' shape . The shape is also a problem . The shaver wants to tip over when stored on a shelf on its back . Clearly the engineers noted this and added the two vestigial bumps on the back . That this was an afterthought is clear since the bumps are so small - the result of ensuring that the plastic housing ejected easily from the mold during production .7 . The adjustment wheel does not stay in the N position . There is not enough friction to maintain that setting . It constantly wants to move toward the S position .8 . The desire to have the head on a hinge has also caused problems . The detent that holds the hinge in the shaver body is not big enough . Sometimes when I open the head to clean it , the spring action of the hinge and the smallness of the detent result in the head actually flipping off of the shaver . Once this resulted in all of the head guts coming out . As a result , I am no longer sure that the cutters are matched up . However , do not attribute the lack of closeness of shave to this happening . It did not shave close even before the head popped off .9 . Since you have designed the head to flip open , the plastic cover that protects the head during storage no longer has threefold symmetry . As a result one has to look to see that the cover is oriented correctly . That is really dumb ! 10 . The detents on the protective cover are not strong enough . The cover wants to pop off particularly when you try to put the shaver in the storage pouch .11 . The storage pouch that provided is hard to use . It appears to be too small , although I think this would not be the case if the protective head cover were more secure and if the cord coiled more neatly with the huge plug.I have now purchased a Norelco 6863XL . It works really well and I am pleased . Therefore , please note that the combination of marketing and styling has really worked to the detriment of function in your more top-of-the-line shavers .
 I have been using a cordless razor for 10 or so years now . This is the worst one yet , and the first one to give me a rash every time I use it . I do n't have sensitive skin and it still bothers me on sensitive mode . I am still loking for a replacement for me pre Gillete Braun Razor . It was amazing .
 This seemed like a very cheap knock off of a better product . The whole thing falls apart if you undo one screw to far , I might add it 's the main adjustment screw for it . That in itself would n't be a bad thing if it did n't come apart while you are using it . Can you say ` Pain ? ` The materials seem flimsy and the quality low . Sorry I bought this , now I have to search for a higher quality one.Can you give ZERO stars ?
 Very easy , convenient to use but it only worked for about five months before the battery stopped taking charge . I 'm waiting for a response from Remington to see if it 's covered under warranty .
 The trimmer worked fine for about eleven months , and was met with regular use . However a single two-foot tumble killed it DEAD . Wo n't turn on , and wo n't accept a charge . Beware and take VERY good care of this product should you decide to buy . They do n't offer warranties on this model for a reason .
 This product works well when the battery recharge works ; which is seldom for long.This is my second unit -LRB- an indication that , when working-it works well -RRB- but my last.Poor quality , poor product management on Remington 's part
 I 've been using this trimmer as my main tool for shaving since I bought it about a year and a half ago , using it once a week on average . Very happy until a few weeks ago , when I kept running out of power every time I 'd shave.The battery wo n't retain its charge beyond the first 24 hours after charging -LRB- for however long -RRB- . Problem is the trimmer does n't work when plugged . So basically now every time I want to use the trimmer I have to charge it just before for at least half an hour , which makes it unusable for me.Still 2 stars because it was n't a very expensive purchase .
 This trimmer stop charging after a few months . It will not work even if it is plugeed in ... . useless piece of junk .
 According to the Amazon description , this charger works either corded or cordless . According to the manual , the cord only works to recharge the battery . If the battery is dead , you ca n't use it even with the cord.Also according to the Amazon description , this has a washable design . According to the manual , you must not rinse the cutter assembly under water.But once you charge it up , and keep it clean with the enclosed brush , it does an okay job of trimming .
 I had the previous version of this model for several years and was very satisfied with it . As one would expect , the rechargeable battery eventually ran out of steam , so I replaced it -LRB- ignoring the warnings of reliability problems of the current - 2012 - `` equivalent '' -RRB- . That was a mistake . After less than 90 days , the thing has run down to inoperable -LRB- even when plugged in -RRB- . No drops or other mishandling.I 'm in the middle of a move , so do n't have time to negotiate a return . Will chalk it up to failing to heed wise and experienced warnings - this device -LRB- and probably the entire Remington brand -RRB- is JUNK .
 I used to have the older version of this product , which is no longer available . Both versions have really weak batteries , but at least with the old version you could plug it in and it would operate off the AC directly . On this version , when the batteries die , you have to plug it in AND wait until the batteries recharge .
 But I do n't . I was using a real cheapie in the past and it worked fine but I thought I needed an upgrade . You know , the holy grail . Now my goatee is uneven and I 've tried every ` method ' to use this thing . Also , I do n't like shaving so I use it without the attachment to look halfway presentable . This also does a worse job than the cheap one . I just do n't like standing in front of a mirror till I get cramps trying to make this thing work . I feel like I traded a 2012 Ford for a Yugo.It does look pretty cool but now I do n't . Maybe I 'll hit the flea market this weekend and find something that works . Remington will probably have a booth trying to hock their inventory of this loser .
 It pains me to give this trimmer such a bad review . The trimmer itself is EXACTLY what I want . Great adjustments . Does a fantastic job on trimming everything from my beard to sideburns to whatever . However , here I am less than two years after my purchase and I am looking for another trimmer . Why ? The battery has died . Worse , though it is described as `` corded/cordless '' , it only works cordless . In other words , even though you can have the trimmer plugged in , it still runs on battery -LRB- which wo n't hold a charge anymore -RRB- . I would n't mind if I could just plug in and use the trimmer corded but I ca n't . And the batteries are n't replaceable . Yes , I did follow the instructions on battery maintenance but nothing helps . Looking at the owner 's manual , I see that the MB-300 does operate with AC . However , it does n't look like they make it anymore -LRB- if they ever did -RRB- so I 'm stuck . Does Remington really expect us to buy a new one of these every 18 months ?
 Was quite happy with this razor for about 4 months . Then the battery started dying , slowing lasting for shorter and shorter time periods . Eventually it just stopped holding a charge at all . And on top of that , the plug does n't supply enough power to use the razor , so it 's pretty much junk now . Disappointing .
 If you want a good trimmer , prepare to spend a lot more than $ 30 . This thing barely cuts , it ca n't hold a charge , and it 's loud . To give you an idea of what to expect - two weeks ago the battery died mid-shave , which was probably only the second or third time I 'd used it . Today I needed a little trim and guess what , I could n't finish this time either . Never had such problems with my $ 100 + Norelco . This thing is absolutely USELESS .
 I bought this for my boyfriend 's beard because he lazy about keeping up with trimming it . It worked great at first , but after maybe 4-5 uses over the course of 4-5 months -LRB- I told you he does n't trim up often -RRB- , it stopped working . It lasts for about 5 seconds of use then dies , and you ca n't use it while plugged in . Very disappointed .
 Bought this based on the mostly positive reviews here after my old Norelco trimmer died -LRB- which I was a huge fan of -RRB- , and much to my chagrin , it just died on me a few minutes ago , after about 2 months of use . It was n't even that good of a trim anyways , I had to go over the same spots constantly ; this was never a problem with my previous trimmer . I just ordered a new trimmer , hopefully it 'll last longer than a pitiful two months .
 This is a piece of poorly constructed junk . There are 2 very small prongs that hold the blade in place . When you remove the guard and clean the blade of your hair , they break . Thus making the trimmer only useable if you manually hold the blade down , or makes it loose under the guard.Remington must have outsourced not only quality control , but engineering to China.Terrible . Can not reccommend anyone ever buy this piece of junk .
 After about two years , the battery on this thing is completely shot , which makes the whole thing useless . Even when plugged in , I have to turn it off , wait a few minutes , then I get about 20 seconds of trimming before I have to repeat the process . It 's been getting worse and worse , and today it finally got to the point where it 's no longer able to do its job and is garbage.This would be a 4-5 star product if they had decided to use a battery that would n't make the product worthless after just two years . You get what you pay for .
 This beard trimmer does a great job , but all of that is overshadowed by a dud battery . I have to plug this in the night before I plan to use it EVERY time -LRB- even if I want to use it the following day -RRB- . The battery that came with mine never lasted more than about 15 minutes , which was really disappointing . Maybe I got a dud , but I wish I had returned for a refund right away instead of hoping it 'd work better
 Sort of flimsy and not particularly good at trimming . I used to have the MB 35 I believe and that was great . This one is no worth the money .
 Did a big mistake buying this item . It would have been better if i had ordered my previous trimmer from Philips .
 This trimmer lasted me all of 3 minutes before i was done with it . It could barely cut my rough facial hair even if i ran it over the same spot 20 times . The blades are simply too dull to be of any use for me . I 'd advise against picking this up .
 Not worth it , I was expecting something bet which would do the job but this is a regular type of sh*t you would buy form any store . Not worth it most of these other comments are regular stupid customers who just spend money and think that 's what they wanted . Does not even do the job it 's more of a shaving the head thing
 I have n't even used the product three times . I does n't work anymore . I paid $ 30 for this thing and I want my money back . I will be phoning Remington to let them know about this product . It cuts great , but the product just did n't charge up anymore .
 Remington used to make decent trimmers but now the cutters are so cheap that they 're more likely to yank your hair out than trim it . Their customer service is horrendous . Never again .
 the shaver really only does a poor-ok job . It does nothing to make maintenance of my beard easier . Seems there are cheap products at Walmart , just as good , cheaper .
 This trimmer is horrible ... it took me about 45 minutes just to get an even shave . If you have a really short beard then I suppose it will work fine for you . But if you have a beard around level 3 or higher , be prepared to stand there for at least half an hour trying to get an even shave .
 the shaver works just fine and i charged it the first time i used it and it worked but the second time i use it and went to charge it the battery wouldnt charge . i tried everything and even basically pulled it apart but still could not figure out why it wasnt working
 Tried this trimmer for 3 years , a total of 3 trimmers . Every time , after 4-6 months of use , battery stops holding charge and have to charge 24 hours everyday for a 2 min usage . Put 25 more bucks and get a Braun ... trust me , you wont regret .
 It 's a fairly good trimmer but the batteries do not last very long . If I charge it and use it a few weeks later , it will not last as long as I need to trim my beard . You have to leave it plugged in charging all the time in order for it to be ready when you need it . I have had several Norelco shavers and none had this problem . In the future , I will probably look for the Norelco name . I thought Remington was probably a good name brand but now I am not so sure .
 I like the form factor and it works fine for my beard , but the battery dies after about 48 hours . Since I only need to trim my beard twice a week , when I realize need it in the morning before work it is basically useless unless I remember to plug it in the night before .
 I use this trimmer once a week . It is usually plugged in . In the middle of trimming , it just randomly shuts down .
 I purchased this beard trimmer because I wanted something with more adjustability than most beard trimmers . The unfortunate part is that if you press the trimmer firmly against your face when you shave like I do , then settings 1-3 will be the same . They will be a setting 1 - the closest . Reason for this is the guard is very flexible and does n't hold the 2nd and 3rd settings very well . Overall I do not like the weight , I think it is too heavy for what it is . I prefer the weighting of my Norelco G370 and this is still the best all ` round beard trimmer for my money .
 I received this trimmer for Christmas . One month later , it does n't hold a charge . In fact , I do n't think it 's even charging anymore . I 've had it plugged in for several days and it still sounds like it 's going to die the minute I start using it!Don ' t waste your money on this piece of junk .
 Tried to like it but just ca n't . Does n't come with a stand , battery drains quickly , does n't work while plugged in so if you drain the battery you have to wait until it 's fully charged to use it . Overall I would not recommend this product . Am searching for a new trimmer now .
 I had an old model just like this where the battery worked well and took a charge for years and years of use until it finally died . I could not find a new battery for it , so I got this one . This model from the very first time I used it had a horrid battery life . A full overnight charge would decay in hours and barely give a full trim - if any trim at all . I ca n't rate this low enough as it is useless with the no good battery - even with the charger cord plugged in at the same time you are using it .
 After a year of use for trimming sideburns , does n't keep a charge and you can not use while it is charging .
 So , I got this because I wanted an all-in-one shaver that did n't have 30 stupid accessories for me to store/lose . After searching for a couple of days this fit the bill.The shortest setting is n't quite short enough for stubble , but it works.The blade guard mechanism is still stiff after two years , which is an accomplishment . In most units these tend to fail rather quicklyThe only problem , and it 's a big one : The battery . After six months of use it stopped holding a charge for more than a day . Now , it holds a charge for about 15 minutes , but it runs at such a slow speed that it pulls , rather than cuts hair . IIt has the same amount of power that you 'd imagine it to have seconds before death , a slow slow slow churning.So , the batteries have failed to deliver enough voltage to do anything , and now it 's time for a replacement.Unfortunately this seems to be a theme among Remington products , their touch control razor -LRB- i went through 3 , all returned -RRB- has similar battery issues within weeks . It 's a shame because for another $ 5 per product they could source decent batteries and produce awesome products .
 I purchased this trimmer for the sake of removing the guide comb and trimming my beard to have a `` shadow '' remaining , and used the comb to maintain a sculpted chin with a setting of 3 or 4 . This trimmer allows you to flip a wheel to increase or decrease the width between the guide comb and trimmer head.I went with the Remington MB-200 due to the cost and high star rating here on Amazon , and I was very let down . For starters , like mostly everything else made today , this thing is made with super low quality fragile plastic , in and out . The guide comb is extremely breakable and is made of the thinnest plastic.However , that was not my main issue . I used this trimmer only five times until it completely broke down . Remington used a cheap underpowered motor . In my specific case , the little rotating motor pin under the trimmer head simply died down the more the trimmer was activated -LRB- it was audibly struggling to the point where it sounded like a car whose transmission was about to die -RRB- . Eventually it stopped working entirely , and it could no longer nudge the trimmer head anymore , even though it was fully charged.This experience made me realize that it might be better to simply choke up the $ 80 + to get a real trimmer , preferably a salon-quality one from a big name like Oster , with metallic guide combs . After all , this is something I 'll be using every day for the rest of my life . I 'm guessing these cheap items are assumed to die down in the short-run and therefore be `` disposable . ''
 I went through tons of reviews here about this product before I decided to buy it . Some raised the issue of the trimmer not being able to hold a charge or even work when plugged in . Since the overall rating of the trimmer was good -LRB- about 4.5 out of 5 stars -RRB- I ended up discounting these criticisms as flukes . I bought the trimmer and , for the first month or so it worked great . The trimmer itself is actually pretty good , which I think is the reason it has mostly positive reviews - most people reviewed it as soon as they got it , long before problems with the charge developed . But after a month or so it got progressively worse in holding a charge . Today , two and a half months after I bought it the thing not only barely holds a charge , now it wo n't even charge at all ! Plugging it in now does nothing , rendering it absolutely useless . Unlike some of the reviewers who blamed the problem partially on their own poor maintenance -LRB- like leaving it plugged in constantly -RRB- , I was careful not to leave it plugged in after it had finished charging . Even still , the thing only managed to last a couple of months . Its basically a disposable trimmer . Its just not worth it . Pay more and get a normal trimmer .
 Great shaver however the battery sucks ! After few months with minimal use , the battery no longer charges , so now I have to throw it out . I am sick and tired of this stupid approach to making products - make a weak product so that it can break fast and sell them cheap so people can buy them every 4 months . This is BS , I would rather pay more for a better product so that I do n't contribute to the pollution of the Earth . Not buying another shaver from Remington , although the trimmer was excellent .
 If you only plan to use it with the guard on , you 're probably fine . If you plan to use it without the guard , especially for more intensive / multiple-angle tasks like head shaving , do n't buy it . The top is designed so that if any significant pressure is placed on the blade when used in a pretty normal hand position , it can pop open . If it does n't pop open , the plastic -LRB- ! -RRB- pins in the hinge will break off . -LRB- The hinge is to allow you to open the top and clean out the hair around the driving pin . -RRB- I owned a prior model and it lasted for seven years of once-weekly head shavings with no guard , plus beard trimming . This version lasted barely six months before the first hinge pin broke , and less than a year before the second one broke , rendering the shaver unusable .
 The battery life of this product is worthless . It started running out one month into using it and would n't last despite keeping it plugged in for hours . It drains out in less than 1 minute . Highly UNRECOMMEND buying it !
 I bought this trimmer 18 months ago to replace a Norelco that finally died after 10 years . The functions are great for trimming beard and mustache , but after only 18 months , the battery will no longer hold a charge more than a week or two . Nothing quite as delightful as getting halfway through trimming your beard before going to work on Monday morning and having the battery die halfway through ! And BTW , it wo n't work on wall power ; you have to wait for it to charge up enough to finish ... I 'm used to the fact that electronics are so cheap now that they 're disposable , but this is insulting . No more Remington for me .
 8 months after I bought the trimmer , it will barely hold a charge long enough to trim my beard . When half way through , you can actually hear the blades slow down . Plus this trimmer wo n't work when plugged in , so it 's the rechargeable battery or nothing . Soon it will be in the trash . A big waste of money .
 I do not recommend this trimmer . I have a light beard to keep in shape , and thus twice I bought this product through Amazon . On both , the rechargeable battery died shortly after the short warranty . Non-replaceable battery . Remington would n't help . I even offered to pay for new batteries , but no go . Obviously these are designed to be completely disposable . That bothers me . I bought the second cause it was cheaper than before and I thought the first failure might have been a fluke . That one is on me . I DO NOT recommend this product for anyone .
 I guess I am not alone in my great dissatisfaction with the charging capabilities , or lack thereof , with this unit . What is Remington thinking , really ? Of what use is a product that seems capable of many good years of service , yet in about a year , can no longer be used without first charging it up every day or two . That it ca n't be used while plugged in , unless it 's already charged , compounds the frustration & annoyance ! No matter how long it 's charged , even overnight , it will not hold a charge for more than a day , two at the most . And when it 's dead , even plugging it in does no good . I doubt Ill ever buy another Remington product again , for even the shaver works well , which this one does , if it ca n't be used when needed , what 's the point ?
 The trimmer itself -LRB- which you have to remove to clean -RRB- has very cheap plastic taps that keep it on . I 've had it less than 6 months and it has to be thrown away . I 'd spend a bit more money for something better .
 When my Wahl wore out , I went looking for a substitute . I got this prooduct . The two things I do n't like about it are that it wo n't work when plugged in with the charger -- the charger simply recharges the battery . So if you want to use this thing , you have to make sure it is plugged in and charging for at least an hour before you use it . The other thing I did n't like is that it cuts unevenly . I have to do my own scissors trim after I use this because some hairs are not trimmed . I wish I had n't bought this and just ordered a new Wahl brand -- one which supplies power through the outlet cord and cuts evenly .
 Horrible Product , spend the extra money and get a product that will last . This product has numerous flaws that affect both the usability and the longevity of its use :1 . You CAN NOT use the trimmer unless the battery is charged . I was half an hour late for work today because the battery died mid-trim . I had to wait half an hour before the battery was charged enough to finish the job . There is no battery meter on the product , so the only way to use reliably is too leave it charging 24/7 so that you know it is fully charged when you need it . As you probably know already , leaving it charging all the time is horrible for the battery , meaning that you will probably only get a year or two out of the product before it ca n't hold enough charge to finish a single trim .2 . The adjustable guard is extremely flimsy . If you put even a slight amount of pressure on it , you will end up with an uneven trim3 . The part that connects the cutting blades to the base is extremely fragile . After dropping it one time , it broke off , so now I have hold down the top part anytime I want to use it .
 As a beard trimmer goes this does the job . Apparently though if you snap on the removable guard with any kind of force it will break the 9 level system and leave you with only one . If you treat the trimmer very gently I do n't see this being an issue hence the two star rating .
 I am not impressed with this razor . It is fine for thinning back my goatee and moustache , but it does a lousy job of trimming the line on my moustache . The one positive I can mention is that it holds a charge for a long time and is n't as noisy as other trimmers I 've had . I would not recommend this to anyone - I prbably should have returned it but I used it and waited too long .
 I have to say I am complete disappointed with this trimmer . It does a good job trimming . Where it falls absolutely flat on its face is on the depth adjustment . It is completely worthless . This trimmer only has one depth setting - because if you do n't hold the thing at the right angle , you will trim your beard way too short . Also , there is no good way of getting under your nose with this thing . The depth guard will be up your nostril before your hair even comes close to the trimming blade !
 Long story short , the rechargeable battery on this trimmer is very poor . You have to charge it hours before you shave for it to work for more than 2 minutes . Forget about using this wirelessly at all . If you 're fine with having this plugged in 24/7 , then by all means , buy it.I have never really given anything a bad review on Amazon , as things can be easily researched in terms of quality . However , I made the mistake of buying this trimmer based on the other reviews here on Amazon . What a lot of them fail to mention is that this trimmer has to be plugged in at ALL times in order for it to be able to work for more than one minute . I often wanted to hide the cords for this trimmer , as it makes the sink look messy ; I just wanted to get them out of the way . So I would unplug the trimmer from the outlet and leave it until the next time I had to shave.Problem was , the next time I would go to shave -LRB- say , a week later -RRB- , the battery would be completely depleted . I would plug it in assuming it would work while plugged in . Nope . It works for about 30 seconds , then dies out and stops working.The solution to this was keeping it plugged in at least 2 hours before I needed to shave . I was n't willing to do that . I should n't have to plan out my shaving habits and remember to plug this thing in 2 hours before every shave .
 Just about exactly one year after purchase , this thing no longer works for more than a few seconds . It does not work on A/C . It only works on a battery charge . The battery is just about dead . If I keep it charging , it runs for a few seconds , then dies . If I do n't keep it charging , it does not run at all . From now on I will NEVER buy a product that operates only on a built-in , non-replaceable rechargeable battery that can not run on A/C .
 The good
 Bought this because of the features and the price . I got what I paid for . Battery life has been miserably short since I purchased it in July of 2011 . Even after being fully charged , I am lucky if I can trim my mustache and goatee before it dies on me . And of course , you all know how painful THAT can be ! The battery life would n't have been an issue if it had some type of override , that would allow me to run it straight off the AC outlet . Guess I got a `` lemon '' based on all the positive reviews , but it will be hard to return as all the packaging was recycled some time ago . When I replace it , I will be looking for a better charging system , maybe a rechargeable lithium ion battery would be better . Or , I 'll just find a model that plugs into the outlet , tho that limits portability . Will be somewhat leery of buying a Remington now ...
 Had this trimmer for about 8 months . Certainly did a good job , and I liked the adjustable head , but thenthe battery started to go a couple of months back , and a charge would last less and less time , until finallyit now only runs a minute or less - not enough for even one careful trim.It would n't be so bad if one could run it off house power , but for some odd reason the battery charger onlycharges the battery , it wo n't run the trimmer . So if the battery is dead and you need a quick trim , you ` resimply out of luck.Too bad . It 's actually a good little unit otherwise , but only 6 months of solid operation -LRB- and only occasional use -RRB- is just not acceptable . I 'd rather pay more up front for something that will last longer . Or at least will let me use itplugged in if I need to . -LRB- My old Remington cost a little more , but lasted over 3 years , and could be run offa wall socket as well as batteries - this was the ` replacement model ' - a huge step backwards.And there are too many people here with the same complaint -LRB- or even worse versions -RRB- to feel I just got a rare ` lemon ' .
 I had an old $ 20 beard trimmer prior that lasted years until I lost the adapters . This thing basically came apart in my hand after the 3rd time using it . Look elsewhere . .
 Well , i never write reviews but do n't buy this thing . i had a norelco but i broke it . i bought this as a replacement and the battery life is HORRIBLE . fully charged , it didnt even last through one trimming session . by the way , u cant use the cord as a power source . all it does is charge the battery so when its dead u have to wait until it charges some to finish shaving . if i can save a few people from buying it this review was worth writhing . buy a norelco
 I have n't had this thing for very long , about 1.5 years . I only use it once every couple of weeks to trim my beard . It will not hold a charge anymore . I have to plug it in every time I want to trim and let it charge for a couple hours beforehand , because as other reviewers have noted
 Will not run direct from the AC cord and wont hold a charge long enough to trim your beard no matter how long you charge it .
 Feels cheap and does not perform well . Also , the battery does n't hold much of a charge - not enough to get a full trim finished . I could live with that if it would run from just being plugged in , but it does n't do that either . I 'm throwing this one out -LRB- bought a little over a year ago -RRB- and looking for something that works .
 uneven cutting , no mater what setting as the comb is to wide , and with it removed it cuts your skin .
 This beard trimmer seemed great when I first purchased it , and the price was perfect . After a couple uses I even bought a second one to keep in my travel bag . Within a few weeks , however , I realized this was a mistake . The batteries in both trimmers has quickly become useless , barely holding a charge for a full beard trim even if you keep it plugged in full time . This is a pathetic product and I find it disgraceful that they still sell it .
 I had one before this one that was smaller and so much easier to work with . It dropped onto the floor and never did work right after that . I tried to find the same thing but looks like they quit making that model . This one is just not nearly as easy to use . I really liked that other one . I am the wife that gets stuck doing the trimming around the beard etc. .
 Initially , this thing works great . Holds a charge , does its job , etc. . But after only 22 months the batteries no longer hold a charge for more than a few seconds . Nothing else is worn out and there 's no way to replace the battery yourself . I think a ~ $ 30 trimmer should last longer than that .
 I would not recommend this trimmer if you expect to get clean edges . For short haircuts you need to go over the same area many times in different directions . I also do n't like battery operated trimmers , as when the battery dies , you need to need to replace the battery . In this case you ca n't do that , you need to pay the manufacture to replace the battery . Buy one with a cord .
 After 5.5 solid years with my previous Remington trimmer , I expected a similarly pleasant experience with the 200 . Instead I have had only problems.It 's one plus
 The trimmer itself is great . Numerous depth adjustments and the guard can be removed for sideburns or detail work . However , the battery will not hold a charge for more than 2 days . I only trim my beard once a week , so I have to charge the trimmer before every use -LRB- minimum of 2 hours charging for 2 minutes of trimming operation time -RRB- . If this trimmer was simply a corded model it would be fine . Since it 's battery only and ca n't work when connected to the outlet -LRB- until the battery is charged -RRB- , it 's frustrating . It works -LRB- in it 's own special way -RRB- and my pride wo n't let me replace a working machine . I 'm patiently waiting the day when it dies so I can get a different trimmer with a working battery or a cord . Save yourself the $ 25 and pass on this one .
 Wow , figured this would last me 6 months-1 year because it 's so cheap ... left it charging over night and used for the second time today only to see that by the end of my use three of the teeth on the inner part of the guard are totally bent . When I tried to straighten them back one of them broke off , I 'm so angry ! I guess my recommendation is to not set the trimmer down with the guard resting on anything -LRB- it was in my dopp kit w/things pressed against it ... never been a problem w/my last beard trimmer -RRB- because it 's VERY flimsy plastic , not hard like my hair trimmer guards or my old beard trimmer that lasted me two years . Though they do n't even include a stand , so good luck keeping it propped up on something.Trimmer itself seems pretty good but I could not recommend this product seeing as if any more of the teeth break off the entire thing is useless . Also would 've liked a longer setting or two . I used the 8 setting and my beard is currently shorter than it usually is so not much room for growing it longer .
 This thing is a piece of junk . The angle of the cutter makes it extremely difficult to trim your beard without pulling the hair out or catching on your skin .
 I really like this trimmer and it did the trick very simply but the jog wheel stopped working after 6 months and it has a short battery life . Other than that I really liked it compared to any other trimmer i have used and am buying another one .
 The trimmer would not take a charge . I contacted Remington and they sent me a replacement charger and cord , and a return prepaid shipping label , if needed . New cord and charger arrived ; unit would still not charge . Have returned unit for replacement . Was told to expect its arrival in about a week . Waiting .
 The trimmer just does not do a good job . I went over my beard and head at least 20 times and each time got a bit more trim . After the ~ 20 times my hair and beard looked neat , but that is not what I expect from a highly rated trimmer . It does not matter what angle or how fast you move the trimmer - it consistently does a poor job.As other customers have noted , `` You get what you pay for , and in this case it is not much . ''
 I had a Remington trimmer for many years which I loved . It was incredible , always fast and sharp . When I lost it , I bought this model , but I was really surprised by how badly it cut . It will NOT cut close to the skin AT ALL . It was not able to cut the hair under my nose , and it will simply not cut closer that 1/4 inch because of the way the blades are positioned . So if you need to get close to the skin , for example under the nose or down on the neck , you 're going to be screwed by this shaver . Not to mention that it pulls like the dickens . I am just perplexed by what Remington has wrought .
 My first electric razor.I used this razor for a month and then one day during a grooming session one of the plastic snapped off . My embarrassment was great , as I am a 23 year old man who does not know how to effectively operate an electric razor . My razor which was designed to remove unwanted hair from my face had suddenly removed one of the plastic pieces from its own self . I finished up the best I could on my face ; however my thoughts were that this razor does such a good job of cutting that it accidentally cut itself . I put the razor away with a renewed respect.However , a few weeks later I needed to shave again . As I did so , another tine flew off to evermore decorate my bathroom floor . This made shaving increasingly more difficult . Every few weeks my beard was developing a strange look that I best defended as `` trendy . `` I was going to call Remington and see if they could help , but I felt a little embarrassed as they could probably guess that I did something wrong with the razor . Not sure what I did , but Remington makes great products and they would never sell me something that is easily broken.In conclusion , people who do not have to shave their faces very often are really screwed over by 30 day guarantee programs.I ended up getting another electric razor , but I keep this one around out of respect . It sits on a little throne underneath my sink which is probably what it wanted all along .
 This thing is a piece of garbage for two very specific , and complementary , reasons :1 -RRB- the battery dies after two or three days of sitting -LRB- fully charged -RRB- if it 's not plugged in .2 -RRB- it does NOT OPERATE ON AC FROM THE OUTLET unless the battery is charged . This means that after it 's discharged , you must wait for it to recharge before using it again . I want to jam this things non-functional blades into the throat of every neckbeard that was responsible for saying `` yep , seems fine . '' during the approval process . simultaneously.In summary
 Battery has never held a charge more than a day or two . I have had it for about two months . Last week it would not hold a charge for more than a couple hours . Went to trim my beard today , after having trimmer plugged in overnight , and the trimmer died within a minute . Big PIT to have a section of beard shorter than the rest . I should have returned this to amazon within the 30 days , my fault .
 I purchased this to gift it to one of my cousin in India and after checking the reviews I was very confident that this will be a great gift . Not exaggerating , it started but it just doesnt solve the purpose . I have been using Panasonic ES224s from last 3 yrs and its blade is still much better than this piece of junk . I am not sure if my piece is faulty or what but it just dont work ... it was just so embarrassing to gift something which just dont work . .
 I did n't quite like it . I needed a stubble look and this one had a guard that prevented me to get that stubble look i was looking for . I got another one that is specifically for stubble by Nerelco . Much , Much better than this one . Brice was good .
 I normally do not write reviews of products unless they are somehow exceptional . This is the worst trimmer I have ever used . The teeth are spaced so far apart do n't even think about using it for edging on bare skin because it cuts you instantly . Spend the extra money and get something that wo n't filet your face !
 I owned a previous version of this shaver that was very similar to image on this site . I lost the charger for my old Remington MB-45 so I decided to order a new one . What I received instead was the cheap black and grey version of the MB-200 shaver , which is available directly from Remington at half the price I paid on Amazon . Cheap and poor quality version of this shaver . From now on I make this purchase locally and in person so I know what I am buying . MB-45 is a quality product , but no longer available , MB-200 is a cheap , poor immitation .
 At first , I was happy with this beard trimmer . About 6-8 months later , it fell on the floor and a plastic piece broke off . Now I have it all taped up with duct tape to make it work . Cheap crap .
 Great at first , then the battery can only hold a charge for 3 minutes . Not happy about the product , but guess that is what one can expect from Remington . Still looking for a replacement ...
 Its a decent trimmer but NOT very high quality - Used it maybe 7 times in two years , treated it w kid gloves but the battery one day refused to recharge . I 'm going back to Braun or Philips - Its not my first bad experience w Remington ... but its my last .
 I purchased this a couple months ago . After no more than a dozen uses , it no longer holds a charge , and dies within seconds of being turned on .
 I liked this trimmer . Really liked it . But only for a couple months . Now , the battery wo n't hold a charge for more than about a day.It only took a couple months for me to notice that the battery life was getting worse . A few months later , and it had gotten ridiculous . Adding to the problem
 After a few weeks of use the battery would no longer hold a proper charge and it became a paper weight . Since having purchased this product I noticed many other people had an identical experience . Steer clear ! It 's a shame because when I first got it , it did a great job and then quickly became useless .
 I bought this trimmer in November as my beard was getting fairly long and I wanted it to get trimmed . I put it on the longest hair setting -LRB- 9 -RRB- and it starts taking off large swathes of hair . What gives , Remington ? Playing around with the settings did n't help , it just got progressively shorter . But I wanted to keep my beard , not look like I had five o'clock shadow ! So disappointed in this product . I would n't recommend it to anyone .
 To echo the 100 or so 1 star reviews , after less than 1 year the product will not hold a charge . However what most reviewers forgot to say , the MB-200 comes with a 2 year replacement warranty . Contact Remington for your replacement
 Battery gave out fairly quickly before it would n't hold a charge for less than five seconds . I had to open it up to fix and decided it was n't worth spending the money to buy a new battery and solder it back on , instead I by passed the battery and applied 5V directly to the trimmer . Putting it together though was hard as once you open it stuff moves around because as aforementioned it is cheaply made . Would not recommend because it could not tolerate a once a week trim for a more than a few months . Also it can not be used while charging so once you batteries blow you lose your trimmer essentially .
 Honestly , I do n't write a lot of reviews unless the product I get is absolutely terrible . Unfortunately , that 's why I 'm writing this.First impression was good . Seemed like it was exactly what i needed . A wireless reliable beard trimmer . I noticed the battery charge did n't last too long after the first use . Also i did n't like the fact that the teeth without the head attachment were pretty large and not fine like you want out of a trimmer especially when it comes to bare skin trimming . First time i used this trimmer i noticed that immediately so i began to use the cheap Wahl to shape the edges of my beard because it 's real fine and smooth on the skin . This is certainly NOT like that and honestly I do n't think too much of the Wahl , which is why i bought this trimmer to begin with . But the trimming head is obviously cheap and will cause irritation on bare skin.The beard trimmer died after about 5 months . I bought it around July 25th , 2011 . By Christmas 2011 it had completely died . It does n't charge any longer - the LED indicator light does not light up even when plugged in . If I leave it `` charging '' it will turn on for about 5 seconds before it dies out.I think the head adjustment piece is fine . I prefer it over the Wahl trimmer heads . Honestly , i wish i just spent the extra money on maybe a 30 dollar trimmer instead . Now i 'll end up paying more anyway . ** Also i hate the fact that you ca n't use it when it 's plugged in . It does n't charge . My wahl cost me the same $ $ but atleast if that battery is dead i can plug it in and use it at full capacity -- not so with this .
 It takes a dozen passes of a spot for it to create a uniform length.You ca n't use it while it 's charging.You ca n't use it with water.The available lengths for it are too far apart - the 0 leaves you with almost no hair , and the 1 leaves you with a week 's worth of beard.However , on the bright side , it is fairly cheap -LRB- though I assure you , you get what you pay for -RRB-
 the rechargeable battery on my unit failed , as well , within a couple of months . this seems to be a recurring theme with this product .
 Same as everyone else . Bought this because it had the best reviews , and now it 's dead -LRB- ca n't charge -RRB- . What a waste of money . I guess it 's impossible to find a good beard trimmer out there that does n't just die !
 For the first six months , it worked fine . I 'd used it a half-dozen times before it ran down and needed to be charged . Now , it always needs to be charged , and even after being plugged in for two days , it still only runs at half-speed .
 As other reviewers have said , the trimmer 's battery is terrible . After about three months of using the trimmer once a week , several hours of charging gives me about a minute of shaving time .
 Bought to replace mb-300 with dying battery , the ergonomic design remains the same , but the plastic used for the variable length comb mechanism is cheap and flimsy . It lacks the pop up detail function of the mb-300 . Quality of construction has deteriorated considerably . It 's serviceable , but not worth the cost .
 I bought this in may of 2012 . I use it once or twice a week to trim my beard . The battery now dies after just one or two uses and needs to be recharged . You ca n't use the clippers while they are being recharged . This has made me late on a couple of occasions because I get half way through trimming my beard and the battery dies . Then I have to wait for it to charge before I can finish trimming my beard . I had a Norelco trimmer that lasted 5 years before I bought this one . I do n't see why this one only lasted 3 months.DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT LASTS !!!
 Like many people on here , the product just stopped working one day . I 've had it for maybe 2 years , but only use it ~ 1x per month . It no longer charges or runs . I got maybe 20 uses out of it .
 Received this product in the mail really fast - was very excited . Plugged it in for the recommended 16 hours however it didnt charge.The charge light lit up for the first 10 minutes of charging before going out . I was unable to use this product at all !!!!! very dissapointed.Can ' t comment on its useability as I simply could n't even turn it on!Overall a terrible experience
 If you wan na buy this trimmer , consider yourself buying a 3 hours trimmer . Cause after it 's batter goes out , it never charges again !!!! i threw it away after the battery was out ! there is no way to replace the battery as it ca n't be opened or anything . you just throw it away
 I should have known this thing would fall apart quickly from the price point.Pluses
 I owned the previous model of this trimmer for many years.The charge held for a very long time and for weeks in between uses.The current model looses it 's charge in a matter of days .
 Good price , great adjustability , perfect size but will not hold a charge.Every time I take it out of the bathroom drawer to use the battery dies after 3 seconds of being turned on . I then have to charge it before every use which is very inconvenient.It 's also louder than a few others trimmers I have owned .
 The converter does not accept 240 voltage . That means you ca n't recharge it in most parts of the world . I bought it for a trip and have n't had a chance to use it yet because I ca n't charge it.There is no indication on the Amazon page that the converter has a limited voltage input .
 This is not a reflection on the seller . They delivered the product on time.This is however to tell you not to waist your money on this piece of junk.I purchased this a month ago and it is now unable to hold a charge . One month old.I 'm now back on the road traveling which is why I needed this to start with and am looking for a new shaver.Never trust Remington again.Don ' t Buy !
 The battery got increasingly weak and now , just one year later , it does n't hold a charge at all . Worst of all , it ca n't run on AC power so you ca n't just plug it in to use it .
 Worked great for at least a year . Now the battery wo n't keep a charge , so it 's a worthless . It does n't work plugged in while you are charging it either . Frustrating .
 As a trimmer its great , but after one year the battery holds a charge for about one or two uses , and you can not use this corded , for whatever reason . You can not use it while the charger is plugged in . Seems like a waste , as the product is more or less disposable because of this .
 It works well enough but every time I go to clean the thing , the blade portion falls off . You can look and see how very cheaply this itty bitty plastic piece is . It 's only a matter of time before it wears out , breaks and makes the razor unusable . I 'm just sick of the cheapo plastic designs . Again , the razor works as advertised , but it 's just more cheap plastic waiting to break .
 I have the same experience as mentioned by Amazon user `` Jwilkins `` Worked great for 5 or 6 weeks , used probably 10-15 times . Then it stopped charging completely . Possibly an issue with the batteries , but even so , should last longer than this.Bought overseas , not really worth the effort of getting it fixed as it was only $ 20 ... I wo n't be taking the risk and buying another , even at 1/4 the price of the other ones I am looking at.Now I 'm off to the store to buy another with a half shaved beard .
 This was a GREAT beard trimmer while it worked . But the charger has completely stopped working , so it is broken . I really have not owned this thing that long . Very disappointing . Ca n't suggest buying a product that breaks down like this.I do n't understand how companies that make products to do such a specific thing are incapable of success . How are battery companies not able to make batteries that work ? It is just unbelievable to me .
 Let me start off by saying that the product worked fine the first couple of days . I was very pleased with it . However , after 2 weeks it started having some problems with the battery . Somehow the trimmer kept turning off whenever I put it at a specific angle against my face . I recharged the battery many times but nothing fixed it . The machine turned off at some positions and at others it worked fine . I tried to take it apart to see if it was a problem with the battery but the screws were of the worst quality . They immediately lost all grip and I found myself with no other choice but to buy another trimmer . I have read many good reviews about this product but in my particular opinion I had very bad experience with it . Hope it helps any of you who are about to buy this product .
 Battery wo n't hold charge after a few months . Worst part is that it wo n't even work if it 's plugged in - you have to charge it immediately before you use it and then be completely done within 15 minutes or so when the battery will have died .
 This is a terrible product that should not be sold . After a few months the battery refuses to charge and hold a charge . Tragically , the device only runs off batteries . When the battery finally died after about a year of owning this product , the trimmer would not work even when it was plugged into a wall . It really sucks when you 've trimmed half your beard and your beard trimmer dies and will not charge any more . Not very stylish.Even when the battery was working , the blades were not very sharp and the device did not trim very well . Do n't waste your money .
 When I opened this trimmer the inside plastic bag was torn open and there were cut beard hairs in the blades . Naturally , I returned it , but it 's annoying for me to have to do that when I ordered a supposedly new product . Also , I wonder why Amazon is not refunding my postage . Now I have to chase that down . In their defense , this is the first time -LRB- and hopefully only -RRB- that something like this has happened to me .
 Does not cut well or evenly and does not have a vacuum feature as does the MB70 . I would not order it again .
 Remington has cut too many corners manufacturing this low lifespan trimmer.The NiCad battery as you will see in many of the other reviews is very low quality and guaranteed not to last as long as one would expect.I got less than 6 months of use out of this trimmer and would not advise others to purchase one unless you need another plastic paperweight when it dies .
 Though marketed as a trimmer , I expected to be able to get a decent shave/detail out of this as well . With most trimmers you can remove the adjustable length setting part to shave off stubble and/or detail your facial hair . Not the case here . Even with the adjustable head removed , there is a good few millimeters gap between the blades and the guard , preventing you from getting even a modestly close shave . Not what I was expecting .
 This worked great until I dropped it once . A plastic tab broke off and the length attachments do n't stay on unless they 're held in place now . It still works . . duct tape might help .
 The cord is a cheap deal you have to unwind each time - not the curly kind.The battery does not last long , and when it does die , it dies all of a sudden , without warning and you ca n't use it while it 's plugged in.It 's pretty noisy , noisiest i 've ever owned.Yes , it works , but really , i wish i had n't bought this thing . It 's not a rip off , it 's cheap , and you get what you pay for so if you 're broke , i understand , i am too and it 's why i bought it but now i regret it and wish i 'd just man 'd up and dropped more ona better one , of course ca n't find one made in Germany or USA anymore , all heco in china which means they have useless chinese batteries in them .
 you can not directly plug it and use it . you have to let it charge for an hour!built quality is okaish . very frustrated and disappointing : -LRB-
 I bought the Remington Beard Trimmer Model MB200 two weeks ago . It appeared to be a good product and worked fine during the first couple of times I used it . One of the reasons that i selected this product was the ability to wash the heads with water after use as indicted in Amazons advertising materials which state
 I love this trimmer , but it 's not working anymore . it has a nice feel to it and it has the right settings.i just bought it about 3 months ago .
 I have got this item and I like it very much , but problem is that charger is not working at all . Please give me advice .
 I did n't buy this for my beard , I bought this for shaving below the waist . True story.What I do n't like about this is that it is a trimmer but is sized like a pair of clippers . Normally , trimmer blades are about half the size of clipper blades . The blades on this are way too wide to do intricate trimming , beard or otherwise.This just does n't fit comfortably in my hands , it is just way too thick and I ca n't comfortably trim with it.They need to market this as actual hair clippers instead of a trimmer . It 's just too thick and bulky to be a trimmer .
 I owned the Remington MB-300 for a long time and loved it . When I needed to replace it , the MB-300 was nowhere to be found . Remington 's site is confusing in that it advertises products you do n't see at retailers and conversely it does n't give information about products it makes that do exist at retailers.I found this model as a replacement , and except for being black , it is identical in appearance to the MB-300 . The only difference I can tell between the two is that this one will not work unless the battery is charged -LRB- that is you can not run it off of AC power -RRB- . The problem with this is that the battery charge does n't last long , and I frequently forget to plug it in , and it takes a long time to charge -- so if you needed to trim before heading out the door and forgot to leave this plugged in , you 're out of luck.I wrote Remington an e-mail with a suggestion that they bring back the MB-300 model back in October 2011 , but they never responded . If I were buying one again , I would make sure the model works when plugged in .
 The title says it . I probably used it ten times and now its dead . I bought this because of the good reviews but I got a dud .
 When the trimmer is working properly , it works wonderfully . The trimmer has plenty of power , and the trim adjustment range is more than adequate for me . Where it falls short , however , is in its ability to hold a charge . Like several other reviewers , mine worked great for the first few weeks , but now it only runs at full power -LRB- for about 10-15 seconds -RRB- . It seemed like a great trimmer for the price , and it would be if it were n't for its inability to hold a halfway decent charge .
 I was a little hesitant to buy this trimmer after reading some of the reviews . I 'm glad I bought it . It has worked well for me . I did n't give it 5 stars simply because I had nothing to compare it with . This was the first time ever I grew a beard . I found the settings worked very well and was able to get a nice even trim and lots of complements . ** Update
 When I got this trimmer I was enthusiastic . For as long as I had beentrimming my beard I had mostly used another remimgton unit -LRB- smallsilver remimgton with several heads and a base that you can stick acharger through -RRB- . My older trimmer would give me uneven cuts andwould n't cut short enough . When I saw reviews for this , I figured Iwould give it a shot . After I charged the unit I was shocked to seethat this guy trimmed my beard fantastically . Although , I still needto do some supplemental work around the beard line , this was easilythe best trimmer I had ever used . However , there are two things aboutthis model that I do not like
 If there are any good reviews of this product , it 's from people who just bought it . I LOVED this thing when I got it . That lasted about a month . Now the battery wo n't hold a charge through a single trimming . I have to stage trimming , do one sideburn -LRB- quickly -RRB- then wait a couple hours for the battery to hold enough of a charge to do the next one . No way I could do my beard or mustache at once , have to space my face out over the week . The power adapter is n't one where you can run the thing while plugged in , you have to wait for the battery to charge . Completely useless . Do n't buy this trimmer , it does n't last very long so you 'll just be replacing it soon . SO , I 'm off to buy a new trimmer ...
 It was really great while it was working . Then , the trimmer adjustment broke . Did n't even make it to month 3 . I only use it once every two weeks . It was n't abused or anything ... just garbage.Update
 I enjoyed this trimmer for about a year . It cuts at multiple levels , holds at the levels , is easy to clean , etc.However , after a year , I have to charge it every time I want to use it . #inconvenient
 This trimmer performed well during the first year of use
 After less than a year of use , I have experienced the weak battery claims that other users report , and I just tried to move the head back to clean it , and it broke off and the trimmer is no longer usable . Very poorly designed .
 It 's great when it 's fully charged but you have no idea when it 's going to die on you . The LED simply lets you know that you plugged it in . I LOVE only doing half my beard and the thing dies on me . It would n't be that big of a deal if you could use it while plugged in but when they say cordless they mean cordless only . Next time I 'm getting one with a battery indicator or one that will work while charging .
 The adjustable length scroll wheel broke within two months of me owning this . The scroll wheel is made of plastic and is easily stripped . Save your money and buy something else .
 The rechargeable battery on this has pretty much died in just over a year . After that I got only one or two trims on a full charge ! The genius who designed it did n't even ensure that it will work when it is plugged in . After a couple of trims when it loses charge I need to plug it in overnight so I can use it again for the next couple of times . What a waste!I am back again shopping for a trimmer .
 Charged it for 16 hours before first use like instructed . Only used it once before it wont charge anymore . PURE CRAP !
 I purchased this item 1/30/2012 and tried to return it today , but my refund date has expired . It was going to be the 4th time i would have used it , but it 's not even turning on anymore . Even when i did use it , the battery died within 3 minutes of trimming my beard . I would n't recommend it to anyone . Even if you plug it in to the charger and try to use it , it does n't work . Dont buy it . Not worth it .
 Used this trimmer probably less than a dozen times - for just a few minutes each time and the motor has already died . What a waste of money .
 the Trimmer it self is quite good . but when i receive this Trimmer it was already charged , i use it a few times until its out of battery the problem is no matter how long i tried to charged it will only work for a few second then it will stop , it is obvious the battery is a very cheap and very bad and the Trimmer is useless now
 After about 10 uses , it stopped recharging , then started again a few months later -LRB- I left it plugged in -RRB- . It worked two or three times and stopped again . Goodbye , Remington .
 The razor cuts , and I appreciate that the guides are built in -LRB- and therefore , not lost -RRB- , but the battery trumps all . I use it only once or twice each week and it can not hold a charge between shavings . Since you can only use it from battery , you have to plan ahead and start charging it several hours before you plan to use it . Probably fine if you shave daily , or if you do n't mind leaving it plugged in all the time , but nearly useless for my less frequent uses .
 Even after reading some of the weak reviews , I figured there would be no harm in spending about $ 30 on a beard trimmer . Howeverm like a lot of the other feedback , this shaver worked about 10 times , before promptly dying after being turned for 3 seconds each time . I do want to note that I charged it overseas -LRB- where I live -RRB- using an adapter . This has never impacted any other appliances I 've purchased , but I did want to note it . My recommendation
 It was great for a few weeks , now it wo n't charge at all . What a piece of garbage . You can rest assured that I will never buy anything from Remington again .
 I recently replaced a four year old version of this , when the batteries stopped holding a charge . Now I 'm thinking I should have sprung for a better one , since this died after only four months.I just emailed their customer service , we 'll see if they do anything for me .
 Just like others bad review , it is because of the battery . I hardly used it and when I tried charging it after a few month of being left there , the battery did not charge . Do not buy this product even if it is a portion of the price . That 's what I did and got con .
 I bought this product a few months -LRB- less than 6 months -RRB- and I have used it around twice a month . Well , now the battery is dead and since this trimmer does n't allow to use it while you have it connected to the electricity , it is just useless , a piece of junk !
 I purchased this shaver one year ago and it has worked perfectly until the plastic comb broke that guides the razor . Now it cuts rows in my beard ! I have checked with Remington and other outlets and no one carries the part . Old story ... product works and plastic breaks .
 This trimmer looks good . However , it does not hold a battery charge beyond 2 trimmings.The charger can not be used to operate the trimmer . Therefore , you must wait 14-16 hours to use the trimmer if it is not fully charged.This is the worst trimmer that I have ever used and I have had a beard for over 25 years .
 One simple reason why you dont want this pos is the plug to charge it gets put in on the bottom of the base !!! How the heck do you expect us to charge this while its standing up like every other shaver in creation !! i dont want my razor laying on its side like its a beached whale !!! How lame is that !!!! Why didnt they show that on the picture !! I wish I hadnt ripped the box I never expected this plug to go on the bottom , and why dont they make the one with the vacuum catcher on the bottom . This gets hair all over the place . Why discontinue a great product and make this pos . Also the top plastic trimmer adjuster piece is closed in the a cage , I have never seen that before , its weird . The only other razor that sits on the side is called the man groomer but you only use that for body hair once in a blue moon . To have a razor you use weekly sitting on its side is ridiculous . Buy something else or make sure your plug doesnt go on the bottom of anything else you buy .
 Like the trimmer a lot - the charger stopped working after one week of use and I had to buy another one .
 Though the price was appealing I was n't satisfied with what it did.It 's just your average trimmer -LRB- clipper -RRB- with a Guard / Head -LRB- plastic cap -RRB- on it that can be adjusted by turning a wheel.The titanium blades felt powerful but it was either too short / too long when trimming my beard ... was n't happy with it .
 Bought this a month or two ago . I used it about two times a week , for quick trimming . Unfortunately , it 's a lot flimsier than it looks , and the slider bar broke rendering the device useless as anything but an edger . The slider will not hold the guard in place any longer , as the two plastic clips on either side fall to the lowest slot regardless of the position the slider is in . It looks sleek but the components are cheap plastic . You might have better luck , but do n't be disappointed if it does n't last more than a month or two .
 I used it for several times , but whenthe battery was off , I could n't charge it , the indicator was not lightning and the battery was not charging .
 I really liked this beard trimmer when I got it , but within a few months the battery started to go dead . Problem is that it does not function while plugged in , so the only way to get it to work is with it being charged up . It wo n't take enough charge for me to trim my whole beard , which is very very annoying . Stay far away from this product unless you want to replace it within a few months .
 this product came free -LRB- ? -RRB- with a panasonic razor . does a okay job but does not hold a charge . would not purchase as a single item .
 had awesome reviews , i actually got it when it was 17 bucks , works alright , not very even , but then it stopped charging like all the low reviews say so now its worthless . . theres a 2 year warrenty but its honestly not that great , doesnt get short enough for me , i just got the istubble and from my limited use i love it
 charged this thing up , used it on a once , was going to use it again 3 days later and the battery was dead so I charged it up , it worked for maybe 5 mins and started dying after that it would not take a charge , it would work for maybe 2 minutes and die on me . Like the title says Dont buy , its a waste of money
 I 'm writing this review after using the product for a few months -- I 'm glad I waited.Overall this product worked fairly well , you can adjust the for the perfect trim of your beard or mustache depending on how long you want it.A few weeks ago I tried to trim my beard . I turn on the trimmer and about 5 seconds later it turns off due to not holding a charge . I 've been trying to charge since then , its definitely not a user error ; the battery no longer holds a charge . I would not suggest this product to a friend .
 Unfortunately , this stopped working after about 6 months . Not very sturdy and we ended up buying a replacement on-the-ground so we could see how well-made/sturdy it was .
 Purchased on
 Pro
 At first , the battery would last for weeks on a single charge . Towards the end , after charging for hours , the trimmer could n't sustain operation for not even a minute . I had to throw it out.Not to mention , the blade plate was not secure . It would pop out when I went to use itand I had to careful click it back into place and hope it would n't fall off .
 I bought this product over a year ago but only now needed to write a review . It has stopped holding a charge . When it worked it was great . Sharp , easy to use , easy to clean . It help a charge for a while in the beginning but now it wont even hold a charge for a day.I will be contacting Remington to see what they can do . I assume it is out of warranty.The rechargeable trimmer is very convenient , but I guess I will have to find a different company that uses better batteries .
 I bought this after reading all the rave reviews , and having quite satisfactorily previously owned a Remington beard trimmer years and years ago . It was the biggest mistake I could make.This trimmer will * damage * longer beards . My beard is just over the length of the 8 setting on this , and while the trimmer was powerful and comfortable , a day after using it , my entire beard was completely and irreparably damaged . Where the Remington cuts the hairs is fine - the cuts are clean and straight , not resulting in any split ends . But if your beard hairs are even remotely stiff/brittle and thick , it will `` break '' them in multiple spots . It appears that the blades are `` messy , '' they will do half-cuts in more than one place along a hair . I 'm not talking about one or two hairs here - a week after my `` trim , '' I 've had to manually cull thousands of hairs and am still finding more that have been completely ruined . The only fix at this point is a clean shave and two months regrowth.Don ' t get this if you do n't feel like going clean shaven for a week in order to regrow your hair after this abomination of a trimmer damages it.It works fine if you 're using it to shave rather than trim , or if you 're using it on sparse hair -LRB- mustaches vs beards -RRB- .
 I bought this item in the middle of February and only started using it form April , it worked for a month and now it wont charge up . No matter how long i leave it for charging it just wont work more then 10 seconds . Also the charging indicator does n't light up . Now im wondering if i can exchange or return this item .
 The trimmer seems to be good enough . However , I bought it about 6 months ago and the charger stopped working recently . I have tried to find a replacement for the charger only but neither amazon nor remington itself does seem to sell one . Without a charger , of course , the whole trimmer is pretty useless . If you read through the reviews you will also find others complaining about this very same problem . So if you buy it , you risk no longer to be able to use a perfectly well functioning trimmer due to this problem .
 This trimmer worked perfectly for my beard , except after six weeks it stopped charging . I even tried a different charger , the charge light does n't light up and it does n't charge at all.Since it broke down past the 30 day return policy , there 's no recourse with their customer service either . No matter how good it is when charged it 's just a paperweight now since I ca n't charge it .
 Having used a Remington beard trimmer for 5-7 years prior to purchasing this model , I bought this with confidence that it would produce the same quality results . I could n't have been more wrong.I have a fairly thick beard and after several months it 's become quite apparent that this trimmer is never going to produce an even trim . It does n't matter what angle or how much pressure I use , it just never gets everything.In addition to the inconsistent trimming , the battery holds very little charge . If I do n't plug it in every other use , I 'm left with a dead trimmer the next time I need it . That would n't be so bad if you could use the trimmer while it was plugged in , but you ca n't .
 The Remington MB200 had a good start but a short run . It was the perfect beard trimmer but stopped taking a charge after only seven months of moderate use.ADDENDUM
 This was very hard to program ! I recommend you have someone with alot of patience if you plan on using this ! When my machine finally arrived , it was used ! The whole right side of it had been scrapped up against something . I just decided to keep it and it does work ... . but it was alot of time and energy !
 The 700 did not work right out of the box.Wasted several hours , before I determined the unit did not work.The manufacture has no direct line , could not talk to any.The Amazon company I purchased the unit from offered no support.Telemergency Pro-Elite 700C with Wireless Help Pendant
 I purchased this pill timer hoping for a little functionality , there is none . Nothing is automatic , and the instructions are intentionally vague . I am slowly figuring it out , and I hate the way it works -LRB- or does n't work -RRB- . It is unusable as a daily use device and I am returning it . Someone is trying to sell you junk on this one . There is a nice compartment to store your pills , but no easy way to reset the timer when you take a pill . It is too large to put in your pocket , except by itself . Seems like the pills would spill on the floor if you were n't careful when opening the device . It truly is a `` Royal emergency '' , flush that is . : - -LRB-
 Handy , compact little lighter that worked well for a about 6 months -LRB- with very little use -RRB- before the magneto stopped working . I now see that the item is no longer available ... good thing .
 This unit needs to be usable in all respects by anyone who might need help remembering to stay on a medication schedule . That would mostly be older people . In that respect it falls far short . Two stars instead of one because it does hold pills and you can get them out reasonably easily -LRB- assuming you 've re-assembled it correctly ; see below -RRB- .1 . The slots do hold several pills -LRB- as advertised -RRB- but they are narrow and hard to fill without spilling a pill into a neighboring slot .2 . If you take it apart to wash it it is hard to reassemble . In particular , the center unit that holds the clock has to be inserted just right , which is n't obvious . Once that is in place , putting the cover on is pretty simple , but it 's easy to get the center unit wrong .3 . The clock/alarm is a joke . First , it only alarms once a day , which makes no sense for someone needing to take meds more often . Second , it 's hard to set -LRB- hold down two little keys , release , then press another to adjust hours or minutes -RRB- . Third , the display is small and not well lit . Fourth , there is a `` reminder '' function , which requires more button pushing and notifies you in a fixed number of hours -LRB- not hours and minutes , just hours -RRB- and is easy to confuse with the alarm -LRB- which is a once a day setting -RRB- . Fifth , the alarm is both a buzzer and a small blinking light , but turning the buzzer off -LRB- using the very small switch on the clock unit -RRB- also turns of the flashing alarm . So if you just want to be reminded by a flashing light that you need to take your meds this morning you ca n't do it . And if you want to be reminded in the morning and evening , forget it .4 . The manual is not much help.Seniors would need considerable help setting this up , if it 's appropriate at all . We 'll probably return it .
 This may look similar to other pill dispensers , but there 's a reason it 's so much cheaper . It is just a 28-slot pill box that also happens to have a place to hold an alarm clock . It does not control access to the meds or advance automatically . Fine if you need to keep track of a complicated med schedule , but it wo n't prevent someone with memory problems from taking their meds at the wrong time . BTW , the one I got came with a dying battery in the clock , which means that before I can even use the reminder feature I have to go buy a new battery .
 I wanted a pill organizer that would help me keep track of my pills and remind me to take them . Enter the Telemergency Royalty 100 . PROS : First , the positives . I like that it has slots for all seven days of the week , four times a day
 Product is very cheaply made . I purchased two of them and the timers do not work . Also the parts do not fit together well . Do no waste your money . Very disapointed .
 We do love Enfamil with iron the original , however the Lipil made our baby VERY fussy and gassy . We always supplemented with Enfamil with iron since birth , but when I stopped breastfeeding , I thought I should give him formula with ARA and DHA . Unfortunately he could not tolerate it . I tried Similac Advanced because I read that it had lower levels . Same problem , but not as bad . I have decided to just stick with the original Enfamil and hope for the best . I do believe that this ARA and DHA is causing problems for a lot of babies . I read all over the net about people constantly switching brands , going to soy , and hypoallergenic formulas , when they should just try the original formulas that we all grew up on , and turned out OK . We are making ourselves and the babies crazy with this new stuff .
 this product is bad , very greasy and does not dry on your face like other balms . Would not use again-I quit using - and definitely can not recommend
 Yes they are very low priced , but ran out of power quickly . Possibly these are OK for light duty TV remotes , but beyond that I 'd recommend going with Energizer or Duracell .
 Worst electric shaver in my life -LRB- I 've owned three in 40 years . -RRB- It sounded like an unbelievable bargain , coming from Bell & Howell . And `` unbelievable '' it was . Ca n't believe they put their name on it . Cheap construction , useless shave . It took longer than shaving with lather and razor -- and STILL did n't get everything . Irritated skin through repeated attempts to get a decent shave on any given area of face . Screen broke after just over 90 days of trying to use it -- thus blocking the rotary `` blades '' from rotating . I threw the thing away yesterday . Save your $ 20 and put it toward a Norelco , if it 's rotoray you want . Personally , after this experience , I 've gone back to blades and lather . Faster , cleaner , no irritation , great shave -- and cheaper . I feel like a fool for having believed the ubiquitous TV ads for the Tri-Tek .
 If you pay the shipping fees I will send you mine , But I do n't recomend you .
 The price on this seemed too good to be true , and that is the case . This is not the same color as my previous bottle and does not have the same scent . I gave it to my teenage son , because I did n't want to bother with a return -LRB- and the box was open -RRB- . I do n't recommend this particular purchase , even though this is my favorite scent .
 I have used this fragrance many times before , and I sure that it smells different .
 please do n't buy into the hype or the hope that you 'll find an easy , simple way to achieve a huge jump in physical well-being . The results of this product are totally unsupported scientifically and psychosomatic when consumers rave about it . I tried the product with the Cleanse and Colon pill pre-treatment . Absolutely no benefit . I did n't feel any better , lose any weight , feel any stronger or lighter or clear-headed . Scam .
 This product tastes horrible , it is very chalky and the tablets are quite bulky and leave a bad taste in your mouth . These fiber tablets only provide a minimum amount of fiber and I would prefer if they were a little smaller in size . I am going to stick to my benefiber .
 At first I was delighted with FiberChoice . Recently , not at all . I do n't know if its the inulin or the magnesium stearate , but FIBERCHOICE seems to produce what I have called a GOOD FEVER -LRB- agitated -RRB- , even tough it boosts your immune system you might be over the balance line . I have taken 2 a day , and find my self with not to good sleep.I WILL lower my dose and see how it works . Maybe 2 a week . And I 'll try some of the other fiber , cause I think fiber is good.I RECOMMEND THAT YOU USE IT ESPORADICALLY .
 Quick points -LRB- it 's just a shaver -RRB- - cuts decently close , but nowhere near a shave - large spacing between the teeth , so multiple passes necessary - batteries do n't like to stay seated , a couple of taps of the unit against the hand usually get it running again - it does look good , with a blue power light and rubberized grip - the length attachment is AWFUL ! fills up with hair , has to always be emptied , which would n't a big deal if it was n't so hard to remove ! the intended pressure point to squeeze the head to remove the spacer is n't very effective.I would n't recommend this for a clean shave or a 5pm shadow . this is good for longer-bearded guys who want to shape the beard or pick off the straggler hairs .
 The delivery was fairly on time ... but the product itself was ok at best.Only opened one and the smell was sickly sweet . The feel and texture , Though slipery , I fely ot was sticky . Have n't used any others and probably wo n't .
 They taste so bad they are not even worth using . I have tried 4 of the 8 flavors and they were so bad I am throwing the rest away ,
 i would never get this again ... its way too oozy when u open it . but it does the job.the flavors were fun ! quite potent .
 I threw the whole box away , I had one bar and could n't believe how awful they tasted . Save your money and buy the Atkins bars , they taste much better .
 After washing this by hand -LRB- per the instructions -RRB- the inner lining of the mask is peeling off . The material underneath the lining is irritating to my skin , so after it finishes coming off , the sleep mask will be useless . It also lets light in around the nose .
 Maybe it is because I am a petite woman with a smaller head , but I found this mask to be unbelievably uncomfortable . First off , the velcro in the back is thick and stiff and it went across the entire back of my head making it really difficult to sleep on my back . The eye part is over sized and kept pushing down over my nose . I 've had prior sleep masks that had Velcro but did n't use such a stiff , thick , long strip of it . To make it small enough to fit , I 'm probably going to have to cut the Velcro bits off and sew it together . As it is this mask wo n't stay on and with the Velcro makes sleeping impossible .
 The liner on the inside is only sewn at two points . The liner came loose at every point except the sewn joints in about 1 month . It is not usable any more .
 Cheap material . A seam came apart after 3 uses . The fit is not good , there are gaps along the bottom allowing light to come through . The only way to alleviate that is to tighten the Velcro to an uncomfortable point.I regret this purchase and am looking for a replacement .
 I have the other Bucky eye mask that comes with earplugs and is made of a velour type material and I love it ! I recommend it to everyone I know ! Because of that , I thought this one would also be great for the warmer months . It was great for the first month until it started falling apart . The liner between your eyes and the foam started coming unglued gradually until it was almost completely unglued . Today I went and bought some spray adhesive to try to get a couple more months out of the mask but it is hard to spray the adhesive because the liner is sewn at two points so you have to try to get the spray between the two layers . It is n't worth the trouble . Next time it falls apart , it will go in the garbage . I do not recommend this item and would appreciate any recommendations for similar lightweight sleep masks that are more durable .
 This product is NOT for women ; which is funny because they all have a feminine design . If the velcro touches your hair it will stick to it and God forbid your hair get tangled up in it during the night . I wore this one night and one night only . Terrible design , terrible purchase . What were they thinking ? The person who designed this either has no hair or sleeps standing up .
 Although this mask is relatively comfortable you still can see some light through the flaps on your nose . The really bad thing is that it 's falling apart after a few weeks of use . Not sure if it 's important but I 'm a side sleeper .
 I saw all the great reviews so i got them . The one strap digs into my ear and I wake up with sore ear on the top ridge of my ear . i dont wear them to tight either . 2 thinner velcro straps would be better , one for your upper head and the lower one for under your ears / lower head .
 It was nice in structure and function but the material could n't hold up to nightly use thus the mask layers began to separate . Nice company , they replaced it , the second replacement fell apart as well .
 I found this to be a very comfortable sleep mask , however after only a couple months of use it began to fray around the edges.In less than 6 months it had completely come apart . Based on this I can not recommend this sleep mask .
 This mask has some serious strap flaws .1 -RRB- The strap is too thick . One strap over laps and attaches to the other strap and creates a THICK piece of fabric which digs into the back of your head . Not very relaxing .2 -RRB- The strap slides around , usually down toward my ears . Again , not very relaxing .3 -RRB- The Velcro is the wrong method for this type of adjustable strap . With Velcro there is the soft piece with the loops and the scratchy piece with tiny hooks that attach to the loops on the other piece with loops . With this mask , the scratchy side faces down toward the pillow and keeps pulling threads our of my pillow case . Great . Thanks for ruining my silk pillow cases.If you reverse the strap , then the scratchy side digs into your scalp . Wonderful.My advice
 Bucky Sleep Mask.I was disappointed.The layers became appart and it last just 4 months . I can still use it , but it 's uncomfortable so far.Nevertheless , I deserve a new one
 This mask would have been great if the inner lining did n't peel off and tickled your eyelids while you slept . I would recommend looking for another mask that is not cheaply made .
 I had high hopes for this mask . It does a great job blocking out light , and does n't squash my eyeballs like other masks do . The front piece that goes over the face is soft and silky . I like that it comes in different colors and patterns.The problem is that it 's horribly uncomfortable . In fact , it 's painful . Lying on my back for only 5 minutes , I could feel the thick doubled over velcro strap digging into my skull . Not good . So I turned over and slept on my side . I had the worst night of sleep . The edge of the strap dug into the top of my ear , causing me pain all night . Why I did n't just take it off I 'm not sure , but I was in a half-asleep state and not making logical decisions . I was exhausted the next day because my sleep was so bad due to the discomfort . They did such a good job with the front part , but the strap is awful ! I would make the strap an adjustable soft stretchy fabric material , not a hard thick velcro strap . I also wish they made this in a smaller-face size.I 'm going back to my eyeeco mask - it does a great job blocking out light , does n't squash my eyeballs , fits my face well , and has a very comfortable back piece . I was just hoping to find something a little more attractive than the goggle look ... but I 'll take functional and comfortable over looks .
 When I can get them to stay on , they do a good job of keeping the light out . However , I have yet to have them stay on all night .
 The mask is comfortable and does a great job of keeping light out , but there are 2 significant problems with the design/construction :1 . The strap that goes around your head is fairly bulky and takes some getting used to . In addition when you roll over , depending on how tight you have the mask , the strap may `` stick '' to your pillow rather than your head , thus causing the mask to shift off of your eyes .2 . The bigger problem is simply the construction . As others have mentioned , the inner lining is not attached well at all to the mask . I 've had my mask for a few months and the lining is now coming off beneath both eyes .
 Pretty comfortable and adjustable . Great for taking a nap when it 's not possible to get the room 100 % dark . However , I am a bit disappointed because mine has already started to come apart , and it 's been only 4 months . May buy another one , but first I 'm going to try other brands . Sigh .
 I WORE THIS SLEEP MASK FOR ONE NIGHT AND WOKE UP WITH A CUT ACROSS THE BRIDGE OF MY NOSE !!!!!
 I LOVE this mask and wear it every night . However , after just a few months the inner liner peels away and I have to throw the mask away . This should n't be a disposable item ! I keep buying new ones because they 're so comfortable . BUCKY , PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM ! If you only wear it occasionally , like for plane travel , it 's the one to buy .
 I have a lot of trouble sleeping with even the tiniest amount of light , so I use an eye mask every single night . The Bucky mask is indeed ultralight , and I liked how the eye cups were molded so the mask was n't laying completely against my face , since that tends to make me sweat sometimes.Unfortunately though , after only 2-3 months , the black fabric lining the inside started to peel completely away from the edges . I kept using it for a while , but now it 's barely hanging on around the nose . I had to stop using it , and now I 'll be looking to try a different brand . Too bad : -LRB-
 VERY POORLY CONSTRUCTED . While the mask is comfortable and blocks out all but a wee bit of light from the nose area , it is falling apart after only a few weeks of use . The inner liner -LRB- part that touches the face/eye area -RRB- is already separating from the mask . I would return it if I could , but I believe it 's considered `` used '' -LRB- unreturnable -RRB- at this point . Also , thin strap means it slips off easily , competing -LRB- better -RRB- ones have a wide , sash-like strap .
 I bought this mask in April and while traveling in May it fell apart . Just like other reviewers , the mask separated in to two . I had one I bought at Bed Bath and Beyond 4 years ago that never had this defect . The only reason why I bought a new one , was the elastic on my old one was not as snug . I would recommend buying this else where as it was defective .
 I purchased this Eye Mask based on the rating it has . I have two other eye masks and wanted to know what made these so special . I used my masks in the light and they were so , so in keeping the light out and after seeing the ratings and reading the reviews I thought `` what is different ? '' When I received this eye mask I tried it the first night , I had never used an eye mask at night and it was pitch black . I liked the dark because it helped me to focus on sleep when my eyes and mind wandered . Since this first night I have used this eye mask every night . I have had this mask for 6 months now and and it is coming apart and showing how poorly made it is . It is made of two pieces of cloth glued/attached to a light molded foam foundation . The cloth on the face or eye side is now coming loose in the nose area and peeling upward . The elastic which holds the mask in place was snug and held the mask in a comfortable position . Now after six months the mask is loose slides all over my face . It seems like a simple solution to just tighten the elastic but that wo n't work because the hook and loop of the velcro will not match up . So to tighten the mask the straps need to be removed and replaced with straps with better elastic and new hook and latch.UPDATE 1/22/12I complained I needed another sleep mask and my wife purchased the same one as a gift not realizing it was a problem . So now I have had two of these and my second was worse then the first . The second came apart the same way the first did . Because of the problem I had with the first I watched the second hoping my problem with the first was a fluke . Not only did it come apart just the same I realized something about it as it came apart . As it came apart it started around the outside edges down the nose with the eyes last . I realized the glue/adhesive that molded the mask together broke down with body heat as it was used . The more I wore it the more the mask began to fall apart till it was no longer usable . Look for a different mask and save your money .
 I would 've reviewed this 5 stars if the inside lining had n't come completely off within the first few weeks.love it except for that one - very major - issue .
 lets in light through the sides of the nose , if you have a puny small nose then dont worry about it , this product is for you . If you sleep on your side or on your back this bucky sleep mask is not for you at all because it slides off no matter how you adjust it .
 I have owned about 10 pairs of these bucky eyemasks , because in the beginning , they were great . I love that convex factor and that it is lightweight . However , the inside liner peels off within a few weeks/months . But , I liked them so much that I decided to overlook that problem and attribute it to normal wear and tear , so I bought a few more , which also fell apart -LRB- even faster I might add -RRB- . THEN , I read somewhere that the company fixed that peeling-lining problem , so I gleefully bought 4 more of the `` new '' style , and all of those peeled off as well within a few weeks . I resent that claim that the problem had been rectified with a so-called new , improved design.I am NEVER buying these again , and I feel compelled to inform everyone who is considering buying these that they are cheaply made and fall apart and are not meant to be washed . I have since purchased dream essentials which also has the raised portion so as not to weigh upon your eyes as you sleep , and I could n't be happier . They launder very well , and will last for years compared to these eye masks . They actually have stitching rather than glue to hold the pieces together .
 I really liked this mask , but after a few years the inner and outer layers have separated from the foam inside so I had to throw it away . Maybe it 's not meant to last that long ? I have another one that 's a few years old and it still looks just fine .
 When I received the item , it was apparent that it was a cheaply made product . I now understand what others have said about the velcro joining the two strips in the back of the head . It 'll create a bump where the strips overlap and I 'm not sure how comfortable it 'll be . I have not used this item yet , but will be taking a 5-hour red-eye flight and connecting to a 6-hour flight this Saturday . I 'll see how it goes .
 I purchased the first one through an outside vendor . I really loved that it was light-weight & contoured to my eyes.But after 2 months the inside lining separated from the mask itself.I phoned Bucky inquiring as to the issue . They were extremely helpful and said there was a small batch that did this.I purchased a second one through them directly.The problem is , they only have a 30 money back . Now , the 2nd pair has separated after only 3 months ! So sad , to be on the market for yet another one that actually works and is built to last !
 Top comments you see here are all correct - they let light in around the nose for sure , and the velcro strap is super uncomfortable behind your head . Also , if you leave some of the velcro strap exposed at either end it sticks to your pillow so you basically have to wear it at one length and completely loose the usefulness of the strap.Last bad thing
 Okay , I 'm giving this product two stars instead of one because it was the best eye mask ever unntil it started falling apart . The lining eventually peels apart from the foam . I still wear mine even with the flopping lining , but I am in need of a new mask now . Bummer because the product is EXCELLENT until the lining starts peeling . : -LRB-
 I 've gone through 2 of these . They 're comfortable , and are nice in that they do n't press on my eyes , but the glue that holds the cloth layers on is weak enough that the external layers of cloth begin peeling away and render the mask unwearable .
 Wow , am I ever disappointed in this mask . It gaps all around my nose , particularly if I lay on my side . If I am on my side , it also slides around uncomfortably if I move my head even slightly - gapping even more . If I lay on my back , it gaps less , but there is a lump formed by the velcro that makes this position uncomfortable too . I do n't know what is harder -- falling asleep without the mask with way too much light in the room , or falling asleep with this darn thing on and bright slivers of light still getting in . Seems like this mask works for a lot of people , but not for me . I have a narrow nose bridge -- maybe that is the problem for me .
 Nice design for a back sleeper , but wo n't stay in place or hurts a side sleeper . Oh , and velcro and hair do n't mix , so really it 's not adjustable , because if you do n't completely match up the velcro halves , you may wind up with your hair locked onto the exposed part -LRB- unless you do n't have hair : - -RRB-
 I use to love this product , however this version of the Bucky 40 blinks eye mask is not made to last . With in a month the lining that rest on the face peels away . I thought I may have gotten a defective mask yet me second mask also peeled away with in a month . The eye mask it 's self is to narrow and lets light in . The elastic strap is very uncomfortable and leaves tender spots on my head . Very disappointing . Wish they would go back to the older version .
 If this eye mask actually stayed together I would have given it high marks . But alas ... . not so much . The contoured eye pockets are a great design and the fabric patterns really fashionable . All that is inconsequential however , to the fact that after only a few months the interior lining of my eye mask began to separate from the foam . Is it still usable yes . Do I use it ... no . I got myself some Eclipse curtains from Khols on sale .
 This mask not only leaks light under the eyes but the material traps heat . I think the material just does n't breathe very well and I ca n't stand it . Also , the velcro on the back strap is thick and makes the strap more uncomfortable .
 This mask did not work for me . It felt comfortable when I went to bed but i would wake up throughout the night . I am a side sleeper so the straps would rub against my ears an irritate them . It was not comfortable . I tried it for two night and just gave up on the mask .
 The first month of near nightly use I was loving this eye mask . Blocked all the light allowing me to fall asleep more easily . I would give this eye mask 4 stars if it did n't fall apart so quickly . Like others have said , the inner fabric started to peel off around the nose at first , then continued to un-glue up toward the temple area ... then off to both sides . Pretty disappointed =-LRB- . Also the velcro on the back is a bit thick and may cause some frustration . For me it bothered me some nights , but not others . I 'm going to try and sew the lining in and see if the stitching does n't bother me ...
 Let me first say that I really like this product , it is extremely comfortable and does an excellent job blocking out light , however what good is it if it falls apart in two weeks ? I have purchased these masks in the past and got a very reasonable amount of use out of them -LRB- 8-12 months used every night -RRB- before they fell apart . But , this time , the inner liner came off both masks within two-weeks of use . So , what to give it for stars , hmm , well 5-stars for comfort and functionality minus three stars because I could n't enjoy the functionality for very long .
 I was very VERY hopeful about this , as I too suffer from stomach symptoms . I 've tried many things and nothing seemed to work.I rarely leave negative reviews , but need to be honest about this.The first thing I noticed about 20 minutes after taking it is there is a cooling sensation in your throat from the peppermint -LRB- not a problem -RRB- but then it left this weird unenjoyable peppermint taste in my mouth . After a while my throat felt like an icy/burn and I could n't shake the smell and taste of this softgel.So I grabbed a piece of cake that I felt would be strong enough to get rid of the taste . Did n't work.I downed lots of water to maybe push the softgel down further just in case it was too high up . Did n't work.As I was walking around I felt very nauseas and I ended up vomiting in the closest waste bin I could which was the one next to my desk . It was just coming and coming out . -LRB- TMI Sorry -RRB- I actually feel a little better now since I probably vomited some of it out , even though the icy coolness is still in my throat and I can still the peppermint.I 'm disappointed , I really liked the idea that something pure as peppermint -LRB- one of my favorite flavors ! -RRB- could actually help me with my annoying problems.Obviously I am in the minority with my review , and I 'm sure this may work for the majority . But I felt the need to write my experience after having such an uncomfortable reaction . I really hope others have better luck .
 I started taking this supplement on Tuesday . At first everything was great , then as the week progressed and I started taking the pills more my acid reflux began to act up . If you suffer from acid reflux , do not take it or ask your doctor before using the product . Trust me , it best to be safe and not take it . I been spitting up acid and dealing with brain fog when I started using this product .
 Was not able to take it but twice and each time I encountered the worse heart burn of my life . Not for the squimish !!
 It must have opened in my stomach on the third day because I had terrible burning and burping up peppermint , which was not pleasant since it is strong and burns.Wish it worked for me like the others . Maybe I have more stomach acid than most . I will stick with peppermint tea and hope for the best
 supposed to open in the intestine but it doens ` t. i got heart burn and berps taste like peppermint.awful experience .
 ARGH ! I had such high hopes for this cream after all the great reviews ! It smells awful and it caused my face to break out . So I tried it on my neck and decolletage , and same result - pimples ! -LRB- So in that respect , I guess it made me feel younger ... -RRB-
 Did not like this product at all because of the strong smell , believe me , coconuts do not smell like that . I used it on my butt and legs instead because I could not stand the smell on my face and I did not want to waste the product after spending money on it . Would not buy this brand again .
 Just like previous posters , I usually use water based lubricants because they are safe to use with the flesh light . I purchased KY Intrigue thinking that all of KY 's products were water based and unfortunately I was wrong . It takes more lubricant to achieve the same effect as the water based blends that KY uses . After several applications I still experienced friction as if I did not use any lube at all . I recommend to stick to water based lubricants .
 Save your money and pass on this lubricant . It does n't work with or without a condom . It 's expensive and pretty much useless -- free saliva work better . It 's sticky and does n't glide well . I 'm sure it would be worthless with toys as well , but I did n't try . It is hard to wash off afterwards as well . Pass on this and try something else , there are plenty of better lubes for less money !
 I would give a 0 if amazon let me . Dries out way too fast and overpriced , The Wal-mart brand -LRB- Equate -RRB- of lubricant is 10 times better and cheaper than this garbage .
 I bought this stuff thinking it would be better or `` more slippery '' than the KY SILK lube , but its not even close . Its more tacky or stickier in its feel . If your buying this for use with toys , you will be sorely disappointed . Its also very hard to wash off and leaves a film on your skin . I do n't know what the makers were thinking when they made this stuff , but it 's not anywhere close to being worth the money . If you want the best lube , in my oppinion its KY SILK . Its super slippery , feels great and washes up with ease .
 Thin viscosity lube much like water . Dries rapidly after application . I strongly do not recommend this product . Its cost far exceeds other silicon lubes that outperform K-Y .
 $ 15 for not even 3 fl oz of this stuff ? What an amazing ripoff , simple proof of successful marketing . This stuff is far too runny . It 's too thin to create much of a glide on your skin . It dries very quickly and you 'll find that you have to reapply several times . Ladies , if you 're looking for a lube that can honestly live up to the title `` premium , '' look for Liquid Silk or the Sliquid line of lubes . You 'll get more than twice this amount of lube AT THE SAME PRICE , and get a far superior product .
 I first tried this lube when it came out and was quite expensive , and stopped using it until it dropped considerably in price . About a year ago , KY raised the price by a considerable amount , and at its present available cost I do n't think it represents a good value . There are other silicone-based lubes that work just as well or better for cheaper . The lube is decent , though , for a silicone lube . It 's long-lasting , like one would expect from a slicone-based lube , but unlike many it leaves only a slight residue and has less of a slimey feel than many.Intruige falls short in the bottle department , though . The lid is terrible , and probably half or more of the bottles I 've used leaked considerably . Nothing like having to store your lube in a plastic bag to keep it from soiling every surface it touches . Nothing sexier than a sandwich bag to mix it up a bit , huh ? Anyway , as a silicone-based lube , Intruige risks staining some fabrics , so it 's a especially bad for it to have such a lousy lid design .
 I thought I was buying the OVER SIZED moist heating pad , but it just resulted in being big enough for my hand ... when I needed one that would be big enough for my entire back ... I guess the name OVER SIZED , made me think it was big enough . I think the description of the item is deceiving ... I still want the one that is sized for the entire back , have not idea what size that would be ...
 As a Physical Therapist with 40 years experience , I can assure you these are a far cry from the &#34; hot packs &#34; I used in the clinic back in the day . These are almost worthless ; holds heat five minutes ... . at best . Better off buying a good electric heating pad and wrapping a hot , moist towel around it . I wondered why they were so inexpensive ; now I know why . I have no axe to grind against Chattanooga Group ; this product simply should be taken off the market or be remanufactured to the quality hydrocollator hot pack of the past .
 From the photo , this looked exactly like a hydrocollator I purchased 20 years ago -LRB- yup lasted 20 years with moderate use -RRB- . This one has hardly any heat sink material in it . The canvas covering looks decent ... but the lack of heat sink material is like a car with no engine ; looks good ... but not very useful . Very disappointed : -LRB-
 This was one of the most wonderful orthotics ever made . Too bad the item shown and described on this and every retail website is NOT the item this company will ship to you.The company has discontinued this insole , and now substitutes a stiffer , cheaper item , with only PARTIAL gel plugs on the heel and ball of foot areas . There is no gel running along the entire length of the foot . Yet , this is how the item is still advertised.If you complain , they refuse to pay for return shipping ! At this point , I still have n't gotten a refund . It 's only through the excellent customer support of Amazon that I have some redress .
 I had hoped to add some healthy benefit for my dogs and this product failed miserably . I measured as the bottle says and administered into the dog water system . The dogs would n't drink out of it despite this being their only source of water while we tried it . After three days all four dogs showed sensitivity with red ears and paws ; one broke out in hives on her stomach ! It was a waste of money . Before you complain I did something wrong this was the only thing that changed , once it was gone so was the problems.-SRedwood Siberians -LRB- breed not known for sensitivity -RRB-
 Title says it all . Watch out for suppliers that swap out to a lower performance battery .
 I 've had this battery for about 3-4 months and am highly disappointed in it . The first month or so it worked just fine , but after that , it started losing charge rapidly . I have missed many photo ops because my battery has died after just a short period of use . You clearly get what you pay for ; I did n't want to spend the extra to get the name brand Olympus battery , but I will be now after a lesson learned -- and a lot of photos missed !
 This is a very nice product , but the description says that this product is 100 % cotton . Upon receipt the tag said 80 % cotton and 20 % polyester . We have sensitive skin in our family and I would never have purchased this product if I had known that it was only 80 % cotton as opposed to the 100 % advertised.If you have no concerns about polyester then this is a nice product .
 I just washed this item per the directions . It ripped on both seams ! Do n't waste your money on this product .
 The cover I got is a low quality one . The fabric is harsh and covered in lint balls.The stiching is porrly made as well.I 'm glad I did n't pay full price for this , but still upset about this purchase .
 Very thin and they are too big for my changing pad , which is a standard size . I was disappointed in the quality and will be returning them . The navy is not a true navy , instead it is a bright blue .
 I was rather disappointed with this when I received it . It 's not easy to find a red changing pad cover , so I was excited to find this on Amazon . Well , the material is not as soft as I had expected and is somewhat thin . Not that big of a deal . However , what I hate about it is there are two small holes in the center of it for those dumb changing pad straps to fit through . Who actually straps in their baby when changing them ? So , now you can see the white changing pad through those two holes and to the average Joe it looks like I have an old ratty changing pad cover that I should replace . Oh well .
 I was so excited when I finally found a purple changing table pad cover . It lists that it is a `` contoured changing table cover '' but it does not fit the pad even though the measurements were bigger than the pad itself . Instead of laying flat against the pad it sticks up .
 Had a hard time finding a Navy cover for my son 's room.This one is perfect in color . Nice deep dark Navy -LRB- no hint of royal blue -RRB- . The 2 stars though is because it really does n't have a nice fit and it 's very thin and cheap feeling . It 's also not soft at all . Even after 2 washes . It 's supposed to be for a naked baby bum people . Seriously ? My TP is way softer . For real .
 Pretty color but material is cheap and not very soft . The slits for the securing straps are in an odd place .
 Weird fit , weird material . But I needed a cover in navy which is really hard to find . Its barely worth the ten bucks i paid . It feels like it is 20 years old and is just really &#34; pilly &#34; and not really &#34; terry &#34; at all . Not soft either.Instead , I 'm having a custom one made to replace this one . That one was 40 dollars on etsy but it has an 8 week delivery . This will work until then .
 In the winter time the skin on both of my hands becomes extremely dry and tight , with flakiness and cracks , like a severe dermatitis . I 've been trying every lotion and hand cream I can find to help heal my skin . I saw Dermarest at a local store and felt hopeful that it might work . My skin is so extremely dry that it cracks and creates deep cuts in my skin that are painful . Applying Dermarest felt like I was pouring straight rubbing alcohol onto my skin ... it had a burning sensation and was very painful . I have tried my best to deal with it and I 've applied Dermarest a few time because I thought it `` may '' be working , but each time I apply the lotion it burns so much that I 've quit using it . I do n't know if my skin is just super sensitive or what , but I ca n't use Dermarest . Still searching for a product that will heal my dry irritated hands .

 The product is not very Accurate if I could I would invest more in a more accurate product . Just a basic product
 This product did Not work for us . We followed the directions to properly calibrate the device , but when it came to trying to get the breathalyzer to register , it was inaccurate . We tried numerous times , but the device would either not register , or would register a result and then within 5 minutes the result would be drastically different -LRB- example from .10 to .04 -RRB- . We decided that a better resource is to use good judgement versus the breathalyzer and Not drive after consuming any more than 1 drink . -LRB- We were attempting to see if we would ` know ' when our blood alcohol level was above a .08 , but the device certainly did not assist with the process . -RRB- Maybe a more expensive device would be more reliable . However - Amazon was very prompt about refunding our $ 30 , and the return process was easy .
 This breathalyzer is TERRIBLE !!! Do n't be fooled by other reviews on here . I bought it after reading a story from I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell for the same reason the author brings it to the bar in the story . That said , I wanted it to be accurate , and also not requiring mouthpieces because its a pain to replace those . The first night I had the breathalyzer , I decided to test it out . I followed the directions and calibrated it before I used it . Then I started to drink beer . The breathalyzer kept saying my BAC was 0.00 , even when I had enough beer that I was n't fit to operate the remmote control for my TV . I tried to test it again the next night . The results were better but once again , it kept saying my BAC was 0.08 and I knew damn well that was n't the case . I was so angry that I stepped onto my balcony and chucked onto the street knowing a car will eventually smash it.Don ' t be fooled by the cheap price , this breathalyzer was n't worth the time I spent buying it on Amazon . If I could , I 'd give this product no stars
 This did not work , blew 0.00 after 12 drinks . . does not work and you should not buy it , this is a scam ... they should not be able to sell it
 DO NOT BUY -- INACCURATE READINGS . . HAVE 2 BEERS AT .9 HAVE 10 RUM AND COKES .2
 Blew a 0.00 the entire night . Had multiple people try and it just plain does not work.Not the sellers fault , but just a terrible product .
 This product should only be used to give you an idea of you B.A.C. . I found if you use it a couple of time in one night . It will start giving you what i know are unaccurate levels and sometimes it will stay at one level no matter how much more you my drink . You get what you pay for . You want something better you going to have to spend more money .
 I tested this unit against a police issue DOT approved Alco Sensor IV . Readings were inconsistent . If you want true accuracy so your reading would match a Police Officers reading ... it is imperative you get a unit that contains a fuel cell and is DOT approved.You are gon na pay $ 450 - $ 750 for such a unit , but how much is a DUI ?

 I have owned several Cross pens since graduating from high school in 1968 . I have owned this Townsend pen for many years and paid about $ 100 . The refills are expensive but that comes with the territory . However , the friction fit cap is problematic . There is a nylon or plastic liner in the cap which fails to grasp the pen over time . I have had it replaced once , and now need to do it again . Good news is that Cross offers a `` free lifetime '' repair warranty . The bad news is that Cross charges $ 10 `` handling '' charge for this free service , after the customer pays to ship it back to them . Free ai n't what it used to be . Sorry , Cross , but I would not recommend the Townsend series in any flavor .
 The glasses are waaaaaay to small for a man . I thought they would be good since the description says for both men and woman , but it is in no way big enough for a man . Very disappointed .
 The lens quality was VERY good , but the quality was bad tube , opened alone . And that is not highly recommended .
 Have three pair of these . Two of them have lost the plastic nose pieces . All of them have lost the pocket clip on the case . The two halves of the case quickly lose their snug fit and are constantly coming apart . On the plus side the optics are good and the size of the glasses and case are just right . Wish I could find something better in this style .
 The clip on the case of this product broke the first time I used it . The reason I purchased the product was because of the case and clip . Would not recommend .
 I got them because in the product features it clearly says gluten free . Well , they got here and they arent !!! the package is clearly labeled as `` contains soy and wheat ingridients '' !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I 'm sending those back !
 I got this product without the straps . The picture shows nice straps that can be used to hold the splint in place . The description also mentions the straps . They were MISSING in the final shipment . It was a nightmare trying to put it up with tape.The seller and amazon were actually nice about the whole thing and made the refund process very easy . I would give 4 stars to the seller , but the product itself was totally useless to me .
 I bought several concentrates from Dynamic Health and was always pleased , but they did not have pomegranate with free shipping . So , I bought from Jarrow Formulas . I do n't think it is even Pomegranate . Whatever it is , it is really nasty tasting . I had to throw it away . I do 95 % of my shopping through Amazon ; clothes , shoes , HD television , computers , musical equipment , sports goods , books , etc. . I have been buying through Amazon for almost 10 years , and this is the first time I have been disappointed . This time , I am not only disappointed , but feel that i might have even been ripped-off . If other subscribers have tried this product and liked it , I 'll back off from the `` ripped-off '' part of my statement . But disappointed - I 'll stick with that part of the statement .
 Been using for one month now and the results are the same . Do not see any positive results using this product that promised much but no help . Trying something else now .
 Be aware , some people may react to this product with the shakes , lightheadedness , and dizziness . Use caution !!!! Stopped using the product and symptoms went away .
 The capsules smell strange , and when I see what the powder looks like inside the clear capsules , it 's tiny flicks of orange in a mostly white powder substance.More importantly , since these pills are NOT cheap , it is advertised as if each capsule IS the 600mg dose , where as in fact , you need 2 capsules to get the 600mg , so there 's actually 50 servings . Very deceiving!Haven ' t noticed any change for this past few weeks , and will not order again .
 This is not pure Ginseng . Pure Korean Ginseng is not cut with rice powder , and who knows what else . Not the real thing .
 It 's ok ... use with other products it help with the neccessary engery that I need to get through the work day .
 I havne ' t yet found any supplement that does anything for energy , stamina , or libido . Obviously too many of us keep buying this stuff hoping to find the one that works but this is another that does n't .
 I purchased the pen and began using it and was quickly disappointed . Shortly after I began using it the pen began leaking everywhere . I could do very little without getting ink on what I was working on or my hands . Since this seemed like a manufacturing problem I sent it back to Cross . I called 2 weeks later to inquire about the pen and was rudely told that it would be 6 weeks before I could expect any information and that surely the pen had not been even looked at yet . I found this rather disappointing because I am a brand new customer who purchased a pen that was faulty from the start .
 This vendor posts misleading adds when confronted to refund money he refused . Vendor not providing 2000 Pre-Waxed strips rather only 8 . No where in the add is the number of strips written except for the title of Moujan `` 2000 Pre-Waxed Strips '' . Moujan 2000 is the name of the manufacturer.Moujan 2000 Pre-Waxed Strips For Body
 I bought the fountain pen and rollerball in this finish . It is a beautiful pen with a smooth lacquer finish and feels well balanced in the hand . The converter screws in , which is a plus . The nib looks too small for the size of the pen , however . Writing with the pen is a disappointment . The nib is extremely scratchy and feels like writing with a nail . I sent the pen back to Cross for an adjustment and they lost it . Customer service was horrible . They told me they did n't have time to look for my one pen as they were in their busy season servicing their corporate clients . Some 4 months later after many phone calls and letters they agreed to send me a new pen . It was as scratchy as the first one I received . I 've written with them in pen stores to see if my experience was an anomaly , but everyone I 've tried is just as scratchy as mine . If you draw a line the nib shrieks like running fingernails across a chalk board . I really want to like this pen , but after my experiences with two of them and Cross ' new `` customer service '' I 'll never own another Cross pen . It 's a pity because at one time Cross made some of the best pens in the world . I have several of their fountain pens from the 80 's and they are wonderful writers . But then again , those pens were made in the USA whereas the new Cross pens are made in China .
 I have had a gold chain for my reading glasses before , but somehow this one looks too feminine for my liking . I am sure I will find a use for the chain some day , but not for my glasses .
 I grew up thinking that Cross pens were `` the thing to have . '' My relatives gave them as gifts for graduation and so on . Recently I decided to buy myself one after having used disposable pens for years , and I 'm very disappointed . This pen was beautiful when I got it , but after two weeks in my purse it already had several scratches in the enamel that were deep enough for the black underneath to show through . -LRB- All I keep in my purse is sunglasses , wallet , phone , keys , and pens , so the keys must be guilty . -RRB- Also , it has started skipping although the ink cartridge is not empty yet.I 'm really disappointed in this product . Cross should tell people that these pens are not made to go anywhere except in a nice , soft pocket . And given the fact that the ink is now inexplicably skipping , I 'll probably go back to disposable pens . What a shame , and a waste of money .
 I purchased the Omron large cuff which says on the package you can use with all Omron automatic or manual digital blood pressure monitors with a D ring cuff . I have no idea what a D ring cuff is as my Omron blood pressure machine does n't mention it . My husband has a big arm so I read all the reviews and believed I had found just what we needed so he could comfortably use my machine . Today his cardiologist took him off his meds for a week but he wanted to see what his pressure was . I opened the box , followed the instructions , and the tip did NOT fit in my Omron bp machine . So before you buy this , make sure you do n't believe everything you read !
 Unless your a body builder or have really large arms this cuff is way too big for most people . I am 6 foot , 225 lbs , and it is way too big for me .
 I do not like this item . it does not feel well on the arm . i want to return it .
 Having this Large Adult Accessory Cuff is a moot point since the device I purchased from you to use it on is defective . The device was replaced once with an equally defective unit .
 I ordered the bridge threaders and the description read 10 per pack , 10 envelopes so I ordered a quantity of six expecting to receive a quantity of 600 . Instead I received a quantity of 60 . When I contacted the company they explained that there was an error in the description and I could return them for a full refund . Why could n't they just send what I expected when I ordered . Plus they charged $ 4.95 for shipping an envelope that was delivered first class mail . I will not be ordering these again .
 I looked all over the place for a battery to go in our thermometer and could never find them . This is the right size so I bought it and was hoping it would work and the price was right . Well , it worked ... once . I put the battery in and turned it on and it was fine . Went to use it this weekend and it was dead . The only time it worked was the first day I installed this batter . The thing hardly had any charge at all . What a joke . Save your money .
 I purchased two lithium batteries , in case one happened to be a dud . Unfortunately both were . The first dead before I even attempted to use it and the second only lasted for one use .
 perhaps there is something wrong with my thermometer , but i put these batteries in and not even two weeks later they were dead . i have n't tried any other batteries in it to see if the same thing happens again .
 I got this vac because the Merry Maids who clean my house on occasion use this vacuum . They recommended it . When I got it , I used it for the first time and ended up with a stiff neck and an aching shoulder . The second time , the latch had broken off the back and I had to rig up a way to keep the dust container closed . And then there was another couple of days of aches and pains . I guess the people who rave about this vac are a lot younger or stronger than I am , but I am giving mine away . I would recommend staying away from this machine .
 I recently purchased this product and was very disappointed . I have called and emailed `` Discount Cleaning Products '' several times . There is only a recording on the telephone number that says everybody is busy . None of my messages have been returned . I asked for authorization to return and have been informed by email that my machine may not be returned as it is used . I informed that I used for 3 minutes only to try . Have not received a reply since in spite of several emails and phone calls . THIS VACUUM DOES NOT DO WHAT IT SAYS IT DOES . I do n't know who writes the positive reviews but they must be Hoover executives .
 The comb fits alright , but I find that it frequently gets tangled in the thick , curly fur of my dog -LRB- cocker/terrier -RRB- . Bought it for the Oster A5 . I find the clipper works much better without the comb . Part of the problem may be that I have the # 10 wide blade on my clipper , and the comb is made for the # 10 regular width blade .
 Do n't waste your time or money does not work at all . I felt like this product did not deserve 1 star . I 've given every review a fair rating and this is what this got .
 I purchased this product because I was looking for a natrual treatment for digestive issues.Saw a piece on TV that this product was beneficial for treatment of Crohn 's disease and IBD both of which run in the family.Have been taking for a few weeks . So far there has n't been any relief . I admit that I usually forget to take all 3 doses per day.The product has has not worked for me . I am not really surprised becaus to date I have n't found anything that helps .
 I really was hoping this would work . Tried it last night . I was put off by the strong taste of not just alcohol , but whatever is in it . I have taken alcohol based homeopathics before -LRB- by bioAllers -RRB- , but nothing that has tasted this bad . I followed the directions exactly , taking 30 drops an hour before bed and another 30 at bedtime . I lay there wide awake for over an hour . More wide awake than usual ! I finally had to take a sleeping pill . No go for me anyway .
 unfortunately , the handrail arrived with a defective leg . the push button adjuster jammed on our first trial and was unmoveable making the rail useless for our purpose .
 Did n't last for more than 1 year . Ca n't even run off of AC power !!!!!!!!!!!
 I bought this chair for $ 99 and I expected it to be good for the money . However , not long after assembling it , the bottom cushion becomes very thin , which causes you to feel the hard massaging motors on the bottom .
 The good
 You can only use this as a regular chair . The massage functions only makes noises and shakes the chair . Do n't waist your money on this !
 It came missing parts and was just a vibrating chair . It had no massage function at all . Big waste .
 My view
 Comfort Products is a joke . I have phoned -LRB-800-RRB- 971-4630 many times over the past few weeks . They provide an option for consumer customer support . After phoning the number you press 2 , then 2 a second time for consumer information . The line clicks dead each and every time . If you select option 1 for dealers you can get through . They will attempt to transfer you . You might even be able to leave a message for an Andrew . You will NEVER get a call back . That 's NEVER . The controls on my chair are intermittently failing . The chair is almost new . I would never buy anything again with the brand name Comfort Products . Buy it and you 're on your own . JM
 I 'm a Massage Therapist and can appreciate receiving massage . The massage action is poor . It has weak action ... 5 weak motors . The 5 motors were a selling point for me . I thought the massage would be `` some kind of good '' . It 's not . The portable insert pads that you place in your existing chair are more effective than this one . The seat is adjustable and if you adjust to full height , it really tilts forward on it 's axis . You feel like you 're going to slide , right out of it . The tilt lock feature does n't work in my chair . It feels more secure at it 's lowest level , but too low to feel comfortable at the desk . It has a cordless feature , but you have to charge for 10 hours before you can initially use . Subsequent charging takes too long ... a few hours.It 's not worth the money . This is vinyl and a thin vinyl . The arm rest are skimpy and uncomfortable and slide downward . The seat of this chair is very uncomfortable . There are motors located in the seat . You can feel the motor 's hardware poking into your thighs ... even when not in use . The overall chair is very skimp and poorly constructed.The maker , Comfort Products , has absolutely terrible customer service . If you should need assistance `` while assembling '' , you wo n't get it from this manufacturer . If you call their help line , you will get a recording , stating they will call you back ... within 2 business days ... LOL . I called to inquire about the tilt problem . I left 2 messages , before a customer service rep called back . Problem was never fully resolved.I needed a replacement part after 4 months of use . It took appproximately 3 months for me to receive my part and they sent me the wrong part . Also , the cord of my chair caught in the casters and severed . My fault . I paid 18.00 for a replacement and they sent the wrong adapter . I give up . I 'm buying another chair . I will never buy from Comfort Products again . Sorry I did n't return ... concerned about high shipping cost , but I could have recovered some money if I had.Once you make your purchase and they have your money , they 're done dealing with you . The perception is they could n't care less if you are experiencing problems with the merchandise purchased from them . Once you get frustrated because they are not promptly returning your calls , you may try the phone line they have reserved for vendors . You still wo n't get through . They will cut the connection and reroute your call to `` leave a message '' . Horrid customer service . Just a terrible company.Save yourself some frustation and money . Poor quality and a bad company to deal with.The `` IJOY '' chairs have wonderfully effective massage action , excellent quality and durable , but their chairs are much too low to use at a desk . They 're rather expensive , too.UPDATE
 I leaned back in the chair & the leg snapped !!! I fell to the floor & was injured ! My back & elbow were bruised & I have n't even received a call back from the company . They promised me a new chair with a metal base but 3 weeks have passed & NOTHING ! So be careful , I wouldnt want anyone getting seriously injured from this chair .
 i figured this is something you can go cheap on . how hard is it to make a decent changing pad cover ?! this is poor quality terry , too small for the pad , and already has a hole in the seam after 2 washes .
 I chose this cover for the color and material . I was very disappointed when I put it on the change pad and it did not fit . Our change pad is a standard size by Summer Infant . It did not fully cover the sides and I put something in the center , about the weight of a baby -LRB- I am due next month -RRB- the corners lifted off . It is too bad because I really liked it and had to return it .
 I was excited to find a changing pad cover for $ 10 , but I will be returning this item . The material is SO THIN ! It 's a tad small for a standard size , contoured changing pad so it comes up a bit on the sides which looks very ugly . The purple is a dull lavender , I was hoping it would be a little more vibrant in color . The color I could overlook , but it 's so thin and small that there 's no point in having it . With a coupon I can get a yard of nice minky fabric in the color I want for less than $ 10 and make my own nice thick minky dot changing pad cover . Even if you 're not handy with sewing though , it 's worth it to spend a little more and get something worth having . Do n't waste your time or money on this item .
 This changing table cover was okay . After first wash , it was still okay . Then after consecutive washes , the seams began falling apart . Maybe it was just mine , not so sure . I only have one changing table cover , when soiled , I use the larger/rectangular receiving blankets .
 I bought this changing pad cover because it was really affordable . However , I did not read the description closely enough where it states ` flat changing table cover ' . I have a Summer Infant changing pad that is the standard shape and size and this cover did not fit - it is way too small to cover the pad . Make sure when you purchase this you have a FLAT changing pad .
 Purchased this item for a Serta contour changing pad and it was n't until it was on the changing pad that I realized it did n't fit correctly because it was n't made for a contoured changing pad . I guess I did n't fully read the description so the ill fit was n't that big of a deal . However , the material seems kind of cheap and the terry tends to pick if you catch velcro - from a diaper tab or swaddle blanket - on it . Overall I like the Carter 's and Babies R Us brand changing pad covers much better - the better quality is worth the few extra dollars . I would not purchase this item again , even if it did fit the Serta changing pad .
 I got the first one in July of 2005 and it failed in November of 2005 . I used it at most once a day . I contacted Goodmans and they informed me that all warranty work was handled by Medelco . I contacted Medelco and got it shipped back to them at my expense . After 20 days they shipped me another one which just failed as well on April 25 , 2006 . This is not a quality product and Medelco carries no spare parts .
 the powder was hard as a rock and i could n't get any to pour out of the bottle . called customer service and they never got back to me so l sent it back
 I originally gave this product a good review in spite of negatives from other buyers . I thought the instructions were unclear and this might have caused problems.I have since found the product shorts out after a few weeks of use , just the same as happened to others , so I have to consider it a piece of junk . Do not buy it!James R. Canning
 I have n't noticed any chances not even slightly and I 've been consuming this product for a little over 3 months ...
 I was looking for a product or supplement I could take to give me more vitamins and minerals so looked up different companys and decided to give this one a try , I thought the product would be natural based on the companys website but the product has fructose in it and I hate the taste of fructose and it 's not healthy for me at all , the 1 oz on the bottle is not a real 1oz dosage , once refrigerated the taste turns bad , and lastly the product did n't give me any energy at all.I found a much better all natural product called Moringa Oleifea which i can grow in my own garden or order natural sundried crushed leaves with not sugars or artificial ingrediants added plus Moringa has 10 to 15 times more potassium , iron , vitamins and mineral than any health drink on the market.I tried Maximum Living and got a maximum letdown . . people get moringa you will thank me and get better benefits from a natural tree than a bunch of ingrediants put together with fructose added .
 I was not very happy with mineral rich in terms of it made me lighter than what I am and I am a fair complected person.In addition I did n't really feel the enger that it was suppose to give . I stoped taking it because I did n't seel any hair growth.I believe Honesty love was telling the truth about this product and it worked for her and those who may wear their hair natural.to be honest i did n't see much results .
 I purchased this product for hair growth . My hair is very healthy but only grows about 1/4 -1 / 2 inch per month . I have only taken this product for 3 days so far and immediately had diarrhea about 3 hrs after taking a little less than half of the recommended dosage . I accidentally measured it out wrong to 1 1/2 tspn . The only change I had in my diet was the Mineral Rich which is why I can only deduce it was the drink that made that happen . I did drink the recommended 8 oz of water and I also took the drink after last eating 3 hrs before . The next day I took on a recently full stomach and only took 1 tbsp as I 've read some experienced hair shedding on full dosage . No change in the bathroom . :--LRB- I also have n't noticed any difference in energy however it has only been 3 days . I do plan on continuing to take for 2 full weeks only taking 1 tbsp along w/8 oz water on a full stomach . However , if i notice dehydration from running back & forth to the toilet :--LRB- , I will stop taking it and pour the rest down the drain along with my $ 28.28 . I will update this review in 1 month -LRB- if I remember -RRB- to inform about my hair and whatnot . * UPDATE * It has been 2 weeks since 1st starting this product . I still have n't had any change in energy . As far as my bathroom situation goes , it has n't gotten better or worse , but simply changed . This product literally makes me go to the RR 15 mins or less after consuming it . I make sure to take on a full stomach and quickly drink the 8oz water after the product . It makes no difference . I am still only taking half recommended dosage . I will cut it down to 1/4 recommended dosage daily to see if any changes . Will update again in 2 weeks . * LAST UPDATE * I stopped taking the product 1 week after my last update . No increase in energy noticed . No hair growth noticed but most likely due to lack of time . No change in RR habits . Lowered stars to 1 as I only had cons with this product and have to pour it out .
 I 'm not sure why I brought this tea , but it truly gave me and my husband annoying headaches.The tea taste very good ! Just add lemon and sugar !
 Used to be the best brand name product for cleaning windows . Now , maybe due to environmental laws or cost reducing , this product leaves streaks and makes glass appear foggy and dingy . Try for yourself by cleaning a glass table when it 's daylight out . You can see streaks in the glass even with a lint free cloth . Not sure if this is something specific to CA environmental laws but worth looking into .
 Once a great product ... now it is just a lot of work . Ispent two hours trying to get my glass table tops looking nice . But all this Windex does is leave streaks and film that will not come off by buffing or wiping . Stuck with three spray bottles and three gallons jugs of useless product ! Uck !

 this one have very strong plastic smell , I dont think it is completely okay to breath-in through this product . and when I want to return it . They do not accept it . So it is a waste of 100 dollars for me !
 I wish I could actually review this product , but the fulfillment of my order has been incredibly bad . I placed my order on 1/26 and it has still not shipped ! I keep getting email notices saying that my package will ship soon . I placed orders from two other supplement vendors at the same time as this order and both arrived with 5 days of ordering.So the product may be great , but do n't count on getting it anytime soon .
 I did n't seem to get the health benefits that are mentioned you receive from green tea extract . I do n't think I will buy this item again .
 Although these are described as lightly caffeinated , they make me feel hyper-caffeinated . I do n't have any scientific basis for this , but I ca n't sleep when I take these .
 This is just cheap oil with fragrance added . A sharpie pen written on bottle for scent added . No seal on cap . Oil smells bad on outside of bottle . Greasy and not good quality oil . Can buy your own oil and add scent yourself .
 Saline solution was out of stock at my local drugstore so I ordered this . I did n't like the way it felt on my wound and it did n't give the same feeling of being clean as saline solution that costs much less .
 It was not the quality I was looking for and the price was way over priced . I got a 10X magnifier at a local hardware store for under $ 5.00 .
 Strap does not have any give to it , becoming more of a tourniquet than a support brace . As a racquetball player , for the brace to become effective -LRB- immobilize the aggravated tendon on the innerside of the elbow -RRB- I had to tighten the strap significantly . Since there is no elasticity in the strap , after a half hour my arm was sore from the tightness of the strap . Recommed staying away from this type of brace . If you are playing sports , such as tennis or racquetball , where you are constantly gripping a racquet and need an effective elbow brace , recommend you get Futuro Elbow Support With Pressure Pads .
 I ordered this product , but received a different product than the one I ordered -LRB- and I did recheck my order -RRB- . Now it is difficult to locate the seller to make any kind of exchange . Amazon does n't handle these requests . So now I am stuck with the wrong bottle ! I have used the Magnesium Citrate for many years , so I know it is a good product ! I give it 2 stars for being a good product , but unfortunately the seller made a mistake that was n't handled .
 There were no instructions with these , so I am not sure what I am looking for in the results window .
 Bought 5 ovualtion tests . Tested on three days - used 3 of the tests . On the second day the control mark was present but nothing regarding the test window . Indicating marks did appear on days 1 & 3 . Not sure how accurate these ovulation sticks are . We have been trying to conceive for 19 months - I have used several different brands .
 These ovulation tests do n't work for me , and my cycle is pretty regular .
 I stopped taking it for a while and did not notice any change.I stop taking Metamucil and I noticed the change in one day.Thats because Metamucil is real fiber.This one maybe good for something but if you want to use it for colon motility , it does nothing.The fiber must be non-dissolving for that.Convenience and ease of use yes , but efficacy - who knows.The company puts out no research and no evidence that it does anything at all.If -LSB- ... -RSB- seems too good to be true , it ...
 Competing brands of similar products contain at least 50 % more product in a similarly-sized container . The disclaimer on the package tells the consumer that the product is sold by weight and not volume and that some settling may occur in shipping and handling -LRB- really ? It 's a powder , people . How much `` settling '' can there be ? -RRB- This tells me that they have probably had complaints about this in the past and their legal department created the disclaimer . Either that or they knew it was deceptive from the beginning . I can just picture some marketing genius telling management that by making the container larger , but putting less product inside , they will increase their shelf footprint and visibility , and minimize their product cost while betting that the American consumer is too stupid to notice that the unit cost per oz . is way higher than competitors . Personally , I resent the insult to our intelligence and refuse to buy this product . Tired of weaseling corporations .
 I ordered this product thinking I was getting plain , unflavored Benefiber -LRB- yes , my fault for not reading more carefully -RRB- , but figured I 'd use it up before reordering . The orange flavoring is just awful ! Sickly sweet , cloying - ca n't figure out why anyone would choose to use this when unflavored is available and can not be detected in any food or beverage . Benefiber does what it 's supposed to and does it well , but I would definitely recommend buying the UNflavored product !
 As a fibromyalgia patient I have ongoing problems with constipation . I had been using , quite successfuly for several years , a natural fiber product from dr. natura . However , at times the fiber product was just gaggy . It made a claim and lived up to it especially when using the tea that it was designed to work with . I had seen commercials for Benefiber and thought I would give it a try -- bye bye $ 20 . I used it for a week as directed on the container . I was increasing constipated as the week wore on and ultimately had to resort to UNnatural means to relieve myself.Last night I tried a test ... 2 measured teaspoons in 8oz warm water in a clear glass . I mean , shoot , if it really IS fiber , there should be some sort of thickening , or evidence of fiber , like there should be in my gut to create movement , right ? Nada . It is as clear this morning as when I filled the glass with plain water.Then I read the actual ingredient ` wheat dextrin ' and googled it . Dextrins , of all sorts , are what are used to make glue . Yah . Glue . Yes , Benefiber is clear and quite drinkable , but for me quite worthless as a fiber supplement . Does n't matter how easy it is to drink , if it does n't work!I am now back to using the ` yes , it is sludgy but WORKS ' natura colon cleansing product and am satisfied . However , I now have $ 19 worth of glue component left on my counter . Google did say the food industry uses dextrins to make baked goods crisp . Maybe I could bake with it ?
 Since I 've been plagued with loose bowels for many years , the doctor 's assistant recommended Benefiber to give me some bulk.I have take taking two teaspooons three times a day in hot tea and so far I have n't noticed any improvemet.IN fact , my bowels are even looser.I 'll take it a couple more days in case my body needs to get used to it and see if there is any change.This time I just bought a small size to try out to see if it would work.Other than taking anti diarreal pills I do n't know what else to do . I know I do n't get as much fiber in my diet as I should but I do try to get some in every day .
 I 've used regular Benefiber for a few years and really like it . I thought I 'd try this and that was a mistake . The orange flavor is so strong that I ca n't even finish the glass without wanting to gag . I gave it two stars becauseit does what it 's supposed to do , it just tastes gross . This is getting dumped and I 'm going back to the regular one .
 Useless product ! My problem was diarrhea . My doctor recommended Reguloid -LRB- similar to Metamucil -RRB- . It worked fine , but I wanted something less distasteful . Benefiber is very tolerable with no benefit ! Then to add insult to injury , A supervisor at Novartis Consumer Health , refused to honor their `` satisfaction or money back guarantee ''
 It says it makes you full longer where you do n't have to eat that much . not so . I do n't feel anything but i 'm still taking it because it 's fiber , but i 'll see .
 This product is not as advertised ... It does not dilute -LRB- become clear -RRB- in water . It does have a taste . It does not work nearly as well as the others on the market.I had to give it one star in order to post the review , but suffice it to say , I would have given zero if possible .
 I have Celiac Disease , so was naturally sceptical when I saw the ingredient is `` wheat dextrin '' , under that on the label states `` gluten free , less than 10ppm '' . The Fda says 5ppm is considered GF . I loved the convenience of putting it in coffee in the AM . However part of my disease includes osteo arthritis . Out of desperation I stopped the Benefiber a seek ago & my pain has improved by 50 % . I will not try it again .
 this condom was cheap , did not break ever yet , yes it is thin , but very dry ! we had to buy lubricate for it to slip right in ;-RRB- dryness was the only problem
 This does n't smell ANYTHING like the Sweet Almond I have smelled before . It smells like rancid olive oil with a hint of eucalyptus . Very disappointing . Do n't waste your time or money .
 I have used this product for a few years now and I love the product but the company is what I have a problem with . Shipping took forever to get here and the shipping cost was outrageous . They were on clearance so I got 5 boxes and was charged $ 5 per box in shipping but when they got to my house all the condoms had been removed from their original packaging and place in one box and i was still charged $ 25 for shipping even though it cost the company less than $ 2 . The S&H for this company rips you off !!!
 I brought this product thinking it will make my hair grow as i seen on youtube . i been drinking this everyday for about a monnth and a half -LRB- missing a day or 2 -RRB- & still no results . Im going to continue drinking it & see what happens but by the looks of it nothing no results . However as for as energy & soothing a cramps , stomache aches , and all that cruel stuff it does indeed help .
 I purchased this item because of reviews from youtube . Ladies raved about how it grew their hair . I have been taking it for almost a month . NOTHING !!!
 These pregnancy strip tests gave consistently false positives -LRB- not evaporation lines as they occurred within the time frame -RRB- . I 'd say about 50 % of the time I would see a faint blue line in addition to the test line when I was not pregnant .
 I got these when we were trying to conceive our second child last spring . I took a test a couple of times during the 10 days before my period time frame . They all came back negative . I ended up taking an EPT test a week after I missed my period and got a positive reading .
 I ordered more than 2 weeks ago and nothing ever came ! More ridiculous , they sent me the shipment email same day I ordered and charged me right away . Poor seller , I wo n't buy again and I am going to request an refund .
 I tested on days 24 , 28 and 31 of my cycle , and the results were negative . By this time I was already experiencing uncontrollable bouts of hunger and fatigue . On day 32 I bought a High Street brand and within a couple seconds a faint positive line appeared and within a couple minutes the line was distinct ! For the purpose of this review I tried these tests again ... After a good five minutes with only a negative line showing , a barely discernable positive line appeared . Probably the test I had tried on day 31 beared the same results , but I did n't wait long enough - or look hard enough . Conclusion
 I wanted to save money from buying the OPK 's at the drug store and thought I woudl give them a shot . I wanted to see if these were accurate so I tested using Clear Blue Easy digital OPK and these into the same urine sample . CBE came up positive 1 full day before these did . They are n't as sensitive as they claim .
 I bought these because they were less expensive than my previous month 's supply of Clear BLue Easy Ovulation tests . My cycle is pretty regular..27-28 days . These registered as negative for 2 days before ovulation . I had one Clear Blue Easy test left and I tried that one -LRB- CBE -RRB- immediately after one of these , it was positive ! I 'm not sure if I got a pack of `` duds '' or if these are n't as sensitive as the Clear Blue Easy brand.There was a very faint line , but not as dark or darker than the control line . Which under the instructions on the website indicates that it is a negative test . I do n't think I 'll buy these again ! I will say , shipping was super fast !
 I bought these because they were so inexpensive - and you get what you pay for . First of all , the instructions say to test between 10am and 6pm . But after getting no positive results in 2 months , a friend of mine said to test after dinner -LRB- between 6pm and 10pm -RRB- , and voila - a positive test appeared ! However , the bad part was that I got the positive result only after my temp had spiked that morning -LRB- which says that I ovulated that day -RRB- . So it did not predict the hormone surge 2-3 days before ovulation , like its supposed to . So buy these with that in mind . Maybe buy extra strips and test once after lunch and once after dinner . Good luck !
 I 'm using these along with the saliva microscope , checking cervical mucus , and basal temp charting to pinpoint ovulation . I have PCOS so I 'm very irregular and unpredictable . These cheap sticks are just that . I 've tried using them all times of the day -LRB- even more than once in a day -RRB- and the control line is 9 times out of 10 very light . Sometimes I get a faint test line , but most of the time it looks as if it 's negative . I know it 's not negative because of the other testing I 'm going . I would n't waste your money on these cheap things . They 're very disappointing and discouraging to someone trying to conceive . Maybe I got a bad batch ? I do n't know , but definitely will not waste my money on these again .
 I tested from cd 10 to cd 28 and I never saw a positive . I think you get what you pay for and I will never purchase again . I would rather spend the money to find out if I am ovulating instead of just guessing . It was a waste of money and time .
 The first couple times I took these tests , they came out negative . The next two came out darkly positive . Over a week later , I took it again for the heck of it and it was another dark positive . I had pregnancy symptoms so I took a pregnancy test -LRB- the same day that I got the positive ovulation test -RRB- and turns out I 'm pregnant . This is fine , since we were trying but I think this could be dangerous in certain situations if these tests are defective !
 Yes , they are inexpensive , but , they do not send instructions with them and they are n't as accurate as they claim . I have been taking my basal temperature faithfully every morning , had a spike 2 days ago and still these OVT 's did n't show a positive result . Do n't waste your money , you 'll get pregnant with or without the worry of whether or not you 've ovulated-eventually .
 Save your money and buy something much cheaper than RingStop that actually has a good chance of working . Homeopathic cures like RingStop are only for `` true '' believer types
 I took a double dose , two caps , twice a day for two months as directed . Nothing . Nada . You ask , `` Would the same apply to me ? '' I think so for the following reasons : There are two groups of ingredients in Ringstop.The first group is homeopathic preparations . As far as I know there has never been a valid double-blind placebo-controlled study demonstrating the effectiveness of any homeopathic remedy in treating any condition , let alone something as intractable as tinnitus.The second group of ingredients is a list of minerals , vitamins and herbs , but with no amounts given . No mgs or mcgs . In the supplement industry when someone does this it is usually thought to be `` pixie dust '' . That means the quantities are so small as to be nutritionally insignificant but you can still claim that they are in the product . Even the lengthy brochure inside the box says nothing about the quantities of these ingredients . It does mention that there is no cure for tinnitus though . But I did not even experience a temporary reduction of symptoms.Given all of the above I am not only disappointed in Dr Bob , I am downright suspicious of him .
 It took an excessive amount of time to receive the product . I do not notice improvement with the ringing in my ears .
 This product does not work . I 've had tinnitus for about a year now , and all the books I read about it said that pills do n't work to help reduce or eliminate tinnitus . But , I was desperate to try anything after other treatments had failed . I tried Ring Stop , taking 2 capsules twice a day for two months , as they recommended . It had absolutely no impact on my tinnitus . There was no reduction in the noise in my ears . This product does not work , it does not reduce one 's tinnitus -LRB- at least in my experience -RRB- and I would strongly encourage you not to waste your money on it , as I did . I wish it would have worked , believe me , but as all the books say -- and which I now must disappointingly admit -- taking pills will not eliminate tinnitus . My experience with Ring Stop certainly proved that .
 I purchased this product for my husband . He took it as directed for several months and saw no improvement .
 This is the second tinnitus product I 've tried hoping it might work . It 's just another dissapointment and more money down the drain . What really makes you feel stupid is the warranty . Product takes 3 to 6 months to work but only has a 30 day warranty . Daaaaa Well someone is laughing all the way to the bank .

 Did not notice any difference after taking this product for me.Was just a waste of money in my opinion .
 What an absolute waste of money ... I took this product exactly as stated in the directions and it made no difference at all .
 well I have double dosed the ring stop for 90 days still have the ringing with no change in pitch .
 I have a son who has never fussed taking his vitamins . I love the rainbow light brand for myself so when I saw these I thought great . Wrong ! These taste horrible . At first I thought my son was fussing because they were n't the cool dinosaurs so I decided to give them a try . Yuck . This is not a kid friendly taste at all . Food based or not these are not worth the price because the will not be consumed in my house .
 I was so excited whenI saw the price on these tests , but after using five of them before even getting the TEST CONFIRMATION line to show up , I was over it . I used them as directed , but when I contacted the merchant to ask why the test line might not show up , I was told , `` well , you have to hold your thumb over the test window as you use it . '' This is not , however in the instructions , so I wasted five tests . Now that I know , I have still had trouble with the test line . Basically , you have to use a sterile cup and use them as a dip test . Not exactly what I expected . Skip this product . Buy the Target Store brand tests that work and only cost $ 4 each . It is worth the extra money for your frustration .
 Great price , fast shipping , but not as advertised . They claim they can detect your pregnancy as early as 6-8 days after conception . I took several of these tests starting at 6 days and as late as 16 days after what should be the conception date based on my cycle - all negative . My husband and I decided to read the reviews we found on several sites for this product and the high number of low ratings prompted us to go buy another test from the drug store - first attempt I got the positive I was expecting based on things I knew were different with my body . I then took 3 more of these tests and they have all shown positive , but it was not until 17 + days of conception that they reflected the positive . I would not have wasted them as early as 6 days had I known that trait was falsely advertised . Additionally , 2 of the positives took more than 30 minutes to show the positive !
 These tests are NOT - I repeat , NOT anywhere near as sensitive as they claim . The other drug store brands such as EPT , First Response and ClearBlue are much more sensitive and reliable . I got a positive on all the above mentioned and this `` super sensitive '' `` early pregnancy test '' did not show a positive until days later . Even then , the test line was faint and not as dark as the control line . Finally NOW - I am over eight weeks pregnant and decided I already own these ridiculous things , might as well use them - now I get a bright purple test line . Do n't buy them , they arrive quickly , but they do n't show results early ... they should be called `` later than all the rest pregnancy tests . ''
 I used these tests as directed . I was quite excited to get a faint line for the first time after months of ttc . I was quite disappointed when that line could n't be duplicated on any store brand test . The lines kept coming , even some darker than others but af showed on time . I then tried the test about a week into my next cycle and got the same faint line . These tests are duds and heart breaking . I am very sorry I wasted my money on them .
 I had a second line -LRB- faint , but dark enough to be photographed -RRB- on these tests , visible at 3 minutes and developed at 5 , on 95 % of the 15 I ordered . The `` read by '' 5 minutes and discard after 5 minute instructions are also ludicris since the dye is nowhere done clearing the window until approximately 8-10 minutes . These instructions must be a CYA for this shop since the false positives and evaps are so bad.I was so desperate for a positive that I spent over $ 100 on major brand tests -LRB- CBE , EPT , First Response , AccuClear , Equate -RRB- trying to confirm the lines I was getting on the early-pregnancy-test midstream . I never got a second line or positive result on any other test , with the same urine sample.Which brings me to another point -- do n't even bother trying to use these as midstreams . You 'll ruin them , finger over the window or not . The test area is not fully protected . They must be dipped into a cup of collected urine.Lastly , this company is neglectful by not including instructions with the test . When you are ready to test , the last thing you want to do is have to access the internet to get the instructions . These are considered medical devices and regulated by the FDA ; therefore , instructions should be provided . They also do not provide instructions for dipping in a cup on the website . I dipped for 15 seconds , a good average between most major brands .
 It does n't sag down on my calf , but it wo n't stay up on my thigh either so it ends up bunching up around my knee . Have n't really had it long enough to make too many other judgements but my first impression is about a 2 1/2 star impression . Take it or leave it . I 'm sure there are better products out there.I 've actually returned this item as the bunching up at the knee became more trouble than it was worth . Additionally , the mesh panel located behind the knee was uncomfortable and a huge irritation .
 I should have listened to the other reviewers . This was much too large and even if it was n't I doubt it would have stayed in place . I do n't even know where it is right now , a waste of money .
 I followed the measurements and it is too large . . I tried to wear it but it kept falling down and defeats the purpose of why I purchased it ... for support .
 Just a simple review . I bought a month supply and had been taking for 2 weeks straight and these pills did absolutely nothing for me . For all I know these could have just been sugar pills , because I felt nothing .
 Do n't buy this item . It broke within the first use . We are planning to return it if we can . Do n't trouble yourself .
 I guess you get what you pay for , especially with this set . The scissors were next to useless , dull and misaligned . The forceps were also tough to use . . I wo n't purchase the again .

 The first few days worked great . I could not finish eating anything , I was full with very little to eat but after a few days the effect wore off . I work out daily , count carlories and drink at least 74 ounces of water a day . I did notice a slight difference in my nails and never experienced jitters but that was it . I did not lose any weight what so ever . I think this may be good if you want to have a bit more energy but do n't expect any weight lost .
 I purchased this product based solely on a commercial . I followed the directions - working up from one pill each morning and afternoon to three pills each . The first week I noticed an increase in my energy level , and a loss of about 2-3 pounds . But there were negative side effects . Diarrhea was the first
 It did n't work for me I try to eat less but even then I did n't see results , I 'm so upset . The two first days I had a lot of energy but the 3rd day I was do tired I thought maybe because of my diet . Now two days after I finish the whole bottle I 'm affraid to start again .
 Tried NV-Rapid Weight Loss capsules for 45 days . No side effects and no weight loss . Pretty ineffective but good marketing -LRB- for them -RRB- .
 Three fourths of the way through the bottle and absolutely nothing is happening . I have not lost one pound yet and do n't feel a thing . May as well be taking sugar pills .
 I 've taken other diet pills before , and this one is the worst at curbing your appetite . I still felt sleepy too . And the `` beauty-enhancing '' it claims to give ... I did n't see a difference .
 This product does not work ... it made me more hungry then I have ever been ... it gave me a horrible headache too ! My appetite wasnt surpressed at all , gave me no energy , and it made my stomach hurt ... I say DONT buy this item !
 I did lose 6 pound in the first two weeks . Just hard to remember to take every 6 hours . And you can not have any other caffeine or you 'll get a headache . Overall i like the product .
 Like many women , I suffer from the 10 lb . winter weight gain . I had high hopes for this supplement just to get enough energy back to work out , and hopefully suppress appetite to wean myself off the sugary winter goodies I had been consuming . This supplement had neither effect . In fact , taking it made me even more lethargic and bloated . Instead of dropping 2 pant sizes , like they claim , my pants became much tighter . I quit taking it after a 3-week trial .
 what a waste of money ! Not only did this not help me loose weight but it made me sick . Every time i took a pill , it would upset my stomach . The pills also made me very tired .
 For me , this pill does nothing to suppress my appetite . Actually , it seems that I was more hungry on it , and I do n't know how that could be ! For the first couple of days , my stomach was gurgling and it scared me but it went away . I have taken the pills for about a month , and no weight loss !! I will not get another bottle when I 'm done . BTW , i am exercising too .
 To be honest , I did n't notice a thing . No weight loss , no change in my hair and nails ... nothing . Sorry !
 I bought this about a month ago and have n't used it yet , they did n't ship the instructions with it . It did n't even come in a box just in it 's tube . If anyone has the instructions on how many to take please send them to me .
 The very first day I started taking these pills , I threw up within an hour . It has not suppressed my appetite nor has it given me any energy . Today is my last day taking them , I 'm not even finishing the bottle , as I am incredibly nauseous as I am writing this review right now .
 I have been taking NV for a few weeks now . I have noticed a decrease in my appetite . So much so that the people around me are noticing i eat less . As far as weight loss - nothing ! So i have to say i am a little frustrated but maybe this just was n't the product for me .
 As the other reviewer wrote , these pills made me sick to my stomach , almost immediately after taking . I wish I could just throw up -LRB- sorry -RRB- so I would feel better . My husband has experienced the same effect . Also my stomach felt very jittery , jittery to the point where I was starting to get concerned about it . I wish I could give this product ZERO stars . Carmen Electra you should be ashamed of yourself for promoting such a horrible product . I only hope that this horrible feeling of nausea subsides soon .
 I used this product for 2 months and I think I GAINED weight !! Thought I would like it because it was just 1 pill twice a day ... seemed easy enough ... I constantly had cramps and a very uncomfortable `` gassy '' feeling .
 I 've taken many kinds of weight loss pills , and this is the only product that has ever given me somewhat negative side effects . I started taking it and within 5 days , I dumped the pills in the toilet . Of course , it did work as an appetite suppressant because it made me jittery to the point of nausea . It also made me have rapid heart beat , like to the point of thinking I was going to have to go to the hospital . Like everything though , it may work for some people , but it definitely did n't for me .
 I almost bought this item because it appeared to be pure , as it states in the ingredient section . However , upon checking the Vitamin Shoppe website , I found out that it is NOT ! It also contains
 I 'm 30 years old and we have been trying for more than a year . My first test showed sperm count of just 50 thousand which is practically zero . My urologist gave me Clomid 50mg and it improved my testosterone pretty good however it did n't improve my sperm count much . The sperm count after 4 months was just 1 million and it did n't improve from there . I 've been taking Fertility blend for more than 9 months and there was no improvement . Finally after 6 months my urologist asked me to go for ultrasound and the test showed that I 've had a medium size varicocele . I 've scheduled Varicolectomy surgery in October and boom my wife was pregnant in January . Within 76 days of surgery , my wife became pregnant . We ca n't express our happiness in words . My semen analysis after 3 months of surgery showed 12 million count . So we believe it 's a mix of miracle and varicolectomy surgery , that helped me . I 've changed so many things to improve my sperm count like taking organic green tea , Maca powder , L-arginine , Horny goat weed with maca , gozi berries and most important of all Fortege tablets by Alarsin company -LRB- herbal product from India which my herbal doctor uncle personally vouched for it , so ordered them through ebay -RRB- . I strongly believe that this Fertility blend wo n't work on it 's own if you have a problem like Varicocele and it 's the dominant cause of all infertile men . So my sincere suggestion is please go see your urologist and ask him to prescribe testicle ultrasound , this test will tell you the most important things about your reproductive health . I always want to make it clear that this Fertility blend did n't give any side effects also so it may be safe to take these but do n't rely 100 % only on it .
 My husband 's sperm is below healthy levels in all areas - volume , morphology , motility , etc. . I had him take a double dosage of these pills -LRB- 4 per day -RRB- for 3 months to see if we could get some improvement as we were trying to avoid IVF simply for financial reasons . After another semen analysis three months later , there was absolutely NO CHANGE in any of the areas . Very disappointing !
 I 've been taking them daily , dual dose -LRB- 4 pills , instead of 2 -RRB- , for the past 2 months ... Truth is , I do n't know if they 're working or not.They do seem to make the genitals more sensitive , almost like they have a bit of viagra mixed in them ; though the effect only becomes somewhat noticeable after taking the pills for 2 weeks or something -LRB- unlike viagra which usually works within a few minutes to an hour -RRB- . Wife is still not pregnant ; though there could be a million and one reasons as to why.Often you only read about the positive comments , and nothing about the environment . If the only thing these pills do , is make a man more sensitive , and make him want more sex , it 's only natural that the chances increase for conception.So , no results for me yet !
 tried this product for 2 days only , donno if it work or not but what i know is that it really hurts my stomach . donno why as it all should be natural , but that 's what happened .
 hopefully every thing work out for us wish us luck and good day everyone . i have no idea wat t
 My husband has been taking this fertility blend pill four times a day as instructed to do , they were making him so tired and feel weak , so he only took it once a day two pills . He is still complaining that he feels tired and achey in his back and legs . So i do n't know if its from this or just what he does for a living cutting trees . ? But just wanted to see if anyone else is having this problem with these pills ? I do n't want to keep having him take them if they are n't good for him . ? Fertility Blend for Men
 I 'm very disappointed for this buy , the packing was n't the proper and 1 of the 3 bottles arrived broken , and the capsules were all over the box with pieces of glass .
 ... after a relatively short period of time it stretched out and does n't fit well over the mattress . That being the case it 's very wrinkled and the wrinkles , under the sheet , are rather uncomfortable to sleep on .
 We bought this product for our son 's matress to help us keep it stain free as we wore going to potty training , first time he had an accident it leaked thru it , left a big stain on the matress , we had to just use plastic bags for the rest of the period . Waste of money , worthless product .
 This product is called a `` mattress cover '' . I may be wrong , but I made the mistake of thinking a `` mattress cover '' would cover/protect the ENTIRE mattress -LRB- like a big sack -RRB- . I thought it was a `` mattress pad '' that covered only the top with possibly a light weight material on the side to keep it in place . This product does NOT cover the ENTIRE mattress ! It ONLY -LRB- like my idea of a pad -RRB- covers the top of the mattress . It has some VERY , VERY , FLIMSY -LRB- net like -RRB- material on the side , with elastic on the edge -LRB- nothing to protect the bottom -RRB- . I ca n't think it will hold up very well or protect anything but the top . Needless to say , I 'm not happy .
 This is overpriced and very difficult to program . Also check your state law to see whether you can remove meds from original container when traveling-in my state -LRB- Maine -RRB- you ca n't . There are less complicated , more durable pill box timers out there .
 Did not do the job it was supposed to do , I could have put on hand lotion and it would have had the same results .
 The roll on container leaked the contents , was leaking when I opened it . I did try the product anyway , just rolled in on , did n't rub or massage on . It burned my skin immediately , got all red and welty . I will try DMSO again . I liked the concept of easy application , but this kind is n't it !
 When I opened the shrink wrapped product , I tilted the bottle and the product ran out all over me.The product immediately created an objectionable taste in my mouth . I would n't recommend this product to anyone .
 I tried these because I liked the prenatal vitamin . I wanted calcium , which these have , and I did n't mind taking 6 a day . My periods were already regular and I usually have one day of tiredness before my period . When I started taking these it really screwed up my hormones . I suddenly had 2 weeks of pms and it made my period 6 days late -LRB- it 's never that late -RRB- . I stopped taking the vitamin so my period would start . I thought I might be pregnant - I was n't . I tried taking it again when my period was over . It made me start spotting and feel really bloated again . I went back to my prenatal . I do n't doubt this vitamin has helped a lot of women with pms , but if you do n't have pms I suggest taking a vitamin without `` hormone balancing '' herbs .
 I bought this to try and cut costs from my normal vitamin . This did nothing for me . I felt totally fatigued and had little energy . I ended up going back to my more expensive vitamin and throwing the remaining pills in the garbage .
 I love the Rainbow Light line , but bought this product by accident . I was looking for a bottle with more tablets , but accidentally purchased this one , which requires you to take THREE a day . I returned and purchased the regular one -LRB- which I LOVE -RRB- Women 's Daily Multi
 I love Rainbow Light products but I was not pleased with this particular product . Who has the time to take SIX TABLETS A DAY , of the same vitamin ? If one 's life depends on it , then it will be fine . I definitely would not have purchase this product if I had noticed I had to take SIX TABLETS a DAY . I did n't even bother to take any when I realized I had to consume that many tablets in a given day .
 Reference quantity , I knew I would need to take six/day . I live overseas and believe I need vitamin supplements . But I ca n't handle the taste . Once this month is over , I will go back to One-a-Day or Centrum . Hope you have more success with these .
 When I received this multi I was shocked to read the label and find that the percentages of vitamins listed on the bottle were FOR 6 TABLETS DAILY !!! I do not intend to take 6 tablets of a multi every day . And on top of it , the amount of vitamins and minerals in 6 tablets is just average , meaning that if I take only one I am hardly getting any vitamins at all!This product is a rip-off and very misleading.Shame on Rainbow Light !
 When purchasing I was looking for a one a day multi vitamin . Well the reccommened dosage on these vitamins are 6 a day ! I can barely remeber to take the one never mind 6 per day .
 I am sure it repells all creatures it should repell , but unfortunately , it repells people as well . The whole family could hear the high pitch tone , which you can tolerate for only a few seconds . Unfortunately for us , this investment was a total loss . I purchased other similar Lentek product and it does not have this problem and seems to be working . Purchased through As Seen on TV , unfortunately contacted them after return period was over and they did not have any replacement products on stock . Nevertheless , they were kind to reimburse me for about half of my cost , which was a nice gesture , as the product malfunction was not their fault .
 I got this product and was disappointed that it does not work . All the money i paid went down the drain . It keeps making this tick tick sound that really hurts my ear . The pain lasted for more than couple of days . Dont buy this product , if you have money to spare donate it instead .
 So far not good . Two live-traps baited with chocolate and peanut butter and kitty food have not been successful in catching our mice so I broke down and bought this product . Plugged it in the kitchen and found it emits unpleasant AUDIBLE -LRB- yes , heard by humans -RRB- high pitched noise which gave two people in our apartment a headache . So , I installed it in my room as it did n't bother me as much and a second similar product in the kitchen pantry that is just EMF-based repeller -LRB- and w / no sound non-headache producing -RRB- . Several weeks have passed but we still have mouse sightings and found mouse droppings all over the floor in one room . Product promised results in 2-3 weeks.The air-ionizing and nightlight f -LRB- n -RRB- s seem to work just fine , but I bought this to chase away rodents.Disappointed , housemate has lost patience with non-violent approach is calling for kill-traps . : -LRB-
 I was really looking forward to having this in our home.After a month of use it seems the old fashion mouse trap is what works : -LRB- There is a season during the year where they are a problem on the island so I hoped to avoid it natually with this product but after a month of use we are still catching a few a week.Too bad and to costly to return .
 This item does not work at all . They tried to convince me to keep the product by saying that `` bugs were coming out of the wall due to the sound . '' Nope . The product simply does not work ! Plus , it creates this horrible high pitched sound that 's supposed to be inaudible to humans . Do not buy this product !
 The unit made a chirping sound . The noise was irritating . I bought to repel spiders but did n't keep t long enough to know if it worked for this issue .
 bought a similiar product , does not work , still see a lot of dropings , waste of money .
 I purchased this product , about 2 weeks ago , in the hopes that this type of pest repeller had improved since the last one I attempted 5 years ago . This item has a thoughtful design , including a pass-thru plug -LRB- 2 prong -RRB- and nightlight , and the innovative addition of an air ionizer that made placing this in a bathroom or closet a multi-purpose solution.When I first plugged the unit into my downstairs bathroom outlet , my 2 cats 30 feet away in the living room started to growl and ran upstairs . My child came downstairs shortly afterward complaining about the painful warbling sound coming from downstairs . Apparently the ultrasonic frequency is outside of adult hearing , but adoloscent ears have a hammer and anvil response range beyond that of adults -LRB- until they 're done growing , and the body loses flexibility , such as when the bones start to harden -RRB- . I further tested the unit in the garage and an upstairs closet , but found the results were the same for both cats and family.I am unsure of how pests respond to this unit , but it definitely repelled my cats and child , forcing me to discontinued use of the product .
 If ever there was an advertisement for snake-oil , this would be it . We purchased this exact product and found the following : * It did n't work at all . Saw a cockroach within the first 48hrs of switching it on . Had no effect on the rodent that was scratching away under our house either . * The noise it makes is audible to humans and quite annoying - similar to that of a TV with a faulty tube . Our cat noticed it immediately and apparently did not like it.Our rodent problem grew worse until one day it finally made its way into our house - right beside the Pest Repeller . Evidently it was not phased at all by the noise , the `` high tech digital pulses '' , or indeed the fancy blue night light . Our cat , however , made short work of the rodent . I wish I 'd spent the money on treats for him instead of this useless device.In short , do n't bother with this or any of the other products on the market . Consumer tests have since shown that high-pitched noises do n't seem to affect rats , mice , or insects , so this is technically a falsely advertised product . Save your money . Get a cat . Buy a blue night light for less than a tenth of this.If Amazon would have let me , I would have given it 0 stars .
 Do not buy this product if you have kids of any age . My two daughters , aged 17 and 12 , both came running from their rooms immediately after I plugged the unit into a wall socket complaining of a horrible noise . My eldest described it as if there were a million crickets screeching into a microphone . As such , this product is unusable in my home . It would be nice if the product documentation gave fair warning .
 I bought this and found that it is audible and unbearable to my young adult children . My daughter contacted the company , who explained that usually if it is audible , then it is a defective unit , so we wrapped it , bought postage and sent it back . The replacement unit is no better . I can not say whether it works , since I can not use it in this house without repelling the humans who live here .
 I was very much interested in getting some of these ` ultrasonic ' bug repellers so I took a chance on this one . These things are worse than useless ! I have no idea if it works on bugs , but it would sure as heck drive me out of the house if I did n't un-plug it immediately . Seriously , I tried two separate units in different outlets around the house , these things emit a horrific sound that was maddening .
 Right to the point ! It does NOT work as promised and it is annoyingly noisy .
 This piece of junk does n't repel anything . I 'm not a child but even I have noticed weird feedback noise emitting from the device from time to time . The only good thing I can say is it does make for an interesting night light .
 All the things were in box but the directions did not make it clear how many tubes I needed to fill for my test .
 I had to search really hard to find out about ADDITIONAL LAB FEES . I was able -LRB- from customer reviews only -RRB- to determine that there are indeed additional fees -LRB- charged by the lab you send your specimen to -RRB- . So in other words , you have to pay more money to get your results . I won ; t be buying this as there are other products out there that charge upfront for everything -LRB- no additional/hidden costs -RRB- . And they seem to be CHEAPER . Hope this helps someone else !
 The purpose of Vata Massage oil is to address the particular vitiation of the vata -LRB- air -RRB- dosha in the body , which is the etiological cause of around 60-80 % of all diseases listed in Ayurvedic literature , including nervous disorders . The oil stinks . At least in my case , it did . Moreover , the fact that it was herbalized proved to have no significant benefits over regular sesame oil , whether I used it for abhyanga or in a basti . Finally , given that this oil is much more expensive than regular sesame oil -LRB- from Banyan Botanicals -RRB- , it is highly recommendable for one to purchase and utilize regular organic sesame oil instead . Those are my two cents .
 I got this as a `` hand-me-down '' that was never used and I see why . My child wo n't sit on it at all , she prefers a potty chair . She cries as soon as I try to put her on it , and it does NOT fit that tight on our toilet . I tried to give it away to a friend , who bought the seat and her child wo n't sit on it either .
 Just getting close to the potty training time ... I have two bathrooms , with a round and elongated seat , both slow close and slightly inward angled seats . This Baby Bjorn seat would not fit either of my slow close seats . However , it might still come in handy for travel . Seemed to be good quality and build , just would not secure down correctly due to the the angle of the seat . Guess I will hold on to mine just in case-for travel . In the mean time , I am going to try the Bemis 583SLOW Next Step Potty Built in seat .
 Though this is a nice sturdy potty seat and would probably be perfect for girls or larger boys , it did not work for me . My son has to hoist himself off and on the potty as he is not yet tall enough to rest his feet on the foot stool while using it . The pee guard is so large that I was seriously concerned about his `` equipment '' being damaged in the process of trying to stand up . I recommend the Arm and Hammer potty seat over this -LRB- much cheaper too -RRB- .
 Not impressed and am returning tomorrow . The little wings you have to dial out barely hold the seat in place . Maybe it works for older toilets or german toilets ... but not mine . If the little wings came down more , then it would hook under the lip of the seat . But this will be returned . Got it at babies r us and I will just look for a permanent seat that wo n't fly off while my kid is getting on or off of it .
 This seat is not for a boy who is 1st learning to potty by sitting . In the picture it looks as though the built in deflector is fairly large , though it is not , it does not do it 's job . I love the contour of the seat . But if I pay $ 29.99 for a potty seat I do n't want to clean the bathroom everytime after he goes potty-what a mess . I have found a potty that I love and that works , it is much cheaper as well . I 'm wandering if this potty might be worth holding onto until my son is handling more than one buisness in the potty , -LRB- if you know what I mean -RRB- . Until then this is not the potty for me , if I had a girl maybe . But I have a boy , so please think about this before you buy . I did read one review somewhere that also had this complaint , I wish I who have listened . They need to make the deflector better or make one for boys and one for girls .
 The adjustment in the back does not stay in place so it 's really just a bulky version of a regular toilet reducer with extra places for germs to accumulate . At this price you are better off with a toilet seat that has a child seat built in . This is a bit wobbly and children take longer to be independent on them .
 Would have loved to use this potty seat . Our 2yr old son has been very successful and is completely potty trained , but is still very small compared to the potty . We 've had 2 other seats both of foam / foam plastic and they make me nuts that no matter how much or how long I clean them I ca n't ever get the `` SMELL '' out from what seeps inside the foam . This seat is a great idea -LRB- all easy to clean plastic -RRB- no openings , made for a boy , and most importantly not made of any foam . Problem ... it DOES N'T FIT ! No potty at our house or my parents . We have a new home and standard toilet seats , my parents are quite older , but still standard and of course we can use the gross seats everywhere . Very disappointed .
 Our daughter used this for a little while but I had to keep watching her because even though she is petite it seemed like it was easy for her to scoot onto the back of the seat . I also found it hard to clean because you have to untighten the hinge to take it off to clean underneath . At preschool she was using the stand-alone potty so we bought the babybjorn equivalent and she now just uses that instead . That is easier to clean than I thought .
 My 20 month old Grandson was afraid to sit on the toilet with the Toilet Trainer . When he did urinate , the urine guard was not high enough & he urinated on the area directly in front of the toilet . I did try to position him right up close to the urine guard & he really did n't like that . He has been using a potty chair at home , so I ended up buying the BabyBjorn potty chair with the high back & he likes this . I think he can tilt forward a bit with the use of his legs on the floor , so this helps with him being able to urinate in the potty chair .
 I was excited about this potty but it only fits 1 of toilets which has a more oblong shape , it does n't fit my standard more circular toilets . It is a shame since it seems to be well designed . I like the babybjorn stool and potty chairs - they are great .
 We bought a cheap toilet seat that did n't quite fit our toilet , but my daughter was using just fine . We decided to splurge for this one once she seemed ready for more serious toilet training . She 's 2 and from the first time we put her on this , she said it hurt her legs . The splash guard is wide and digs into her legs and she absolutely refuses to sit on it . Fits the toilet really well , but that 's all I can say positive about this potty seat . Disappointed !
 I bought it based on so many great reviews . I wonder if I am the only one who was not able to attach it to the existing toilette seat . The description says `` adjusts easily and sits firmly in place '' ... well , it does not . It slides right out of the existing seat . SO I basically keep in there not attached at all and have to sit my child and remove him from there , otherwise the seat falls out .
 After a couple hours of reading reviews I bought this seat . Many of the other product reviews said `` not for boys '' . With this seat your boy would have to lean very far forward to not get pee everywhere . I also choose this because it adjusts on the bottom to fit long toilet seats , it fit the seat well . Another problem for me was the size of the hole . I have a big 2 year old and could n't wipe him well . If you have a petite girl this will work for you!Amazon made it very easy to return this product at no cost to me : -RRB-
 This potty seat worked well for us until this past weekend , when my son attempted to use it without a step stool . As he was trying to slide off , the splashguard stopped his progress , which caused the skin just above his penis to tear from the pressure of being trapped . He now has four stitches in a very sensitive area , and this was a very traumatic event for him.The splashguard on this seat is pointless anyway , since it 's too close to allow any room for the penis to extend , and my son has always had to push his penis down to pee into the potty . A splashguard on the floor chair version seems less dangerous , but on this model , where the seat sits on top of an adult potty , having such a high -LRB- and unremovable ! -RRB- splashguard is just plain dangerous.Parents of little boys , beware .
 Based on high ratings/reviews of the product , I purchased the Babybjorn white/blue trainer for my two -LRB- 3 & 6 yr old -RRB- boys . In a nutshell , I would * not * advice parents with boys to purchase this seat . The biggest problem I have is the front shield is too low . Almost always , the babybjorn ring , toilet seat and the bathroom floor have pee all over by the time the boys are done doing their business . This product is not a unisex product .
 I 'm surprised by the high ratings for this product . My wife and I have been very disappointed with it . The main problem is that the splash guard does not extend down far enough . Every time our little boy uses this seat , the bottom of it is soaked , the actual toilet seat is soaked , the underside of the toilet seat is soaked , and the rim of the toilet is soaked . And no , the problem is not our toilet or our existing toilet seat , because the same thing happens on any toilet we use this on . Very poor design -- I do not recommend at all if you have a son . Perhaps if we had a daughter , I would be giving it a higher rating .
 I 'm surprised by how well this is rated so I decided to add my two cents to the minority.The PROS
 I bought this seat for my son because of the built in `` shield '' . I have found it 's a bit short and also that somehow his wetness deflects up under the seat and gets the toilet seat and underneath the seat all wet . I have to always wipe the actual toilet seat and under the potty seat afterwards . Definitely a big mess . Not what I expected from such an expensive seat . Would not recommend
 I was looking forward to having my son -LRB- barely 2 -RRB- use this toilet seat . After we got it , I was extremely disappointed . The adjustable dial did not fit to lock onto any of the toilets I tried in 3 different houses . Without locking it into place though , there was still minimal movement , so it was n't a big deal . What was a big deal was the mess that happened every time my son peed . The splash guard is not tall enough , and unless he points his penis down just right , pee goes EVERYWHERE . I finally got sick of the mess and put the seat away . He just straddles the regular seat now , which is not as comfortable I 'm sure , but it does the job with no mess.Also , my son started to not want to go potty on the big toilet after we 'd been using the seat for a couple of weeks . He wanted to sit on the stand alone fisher price frog potty . After I put the seat away , he stopped going on the frog potty and went back to the big toilet . I do n't know if it was a coincidence or not . But this seat was definitely a waste of money for us .
 This item does not work as described . After painting a letter or shape through the stencil , the applied product just runs together into a big blob . Well at least my wife and I got a good laugh out of it . But sensuous ? Not at all .
 I bought this tub because , well , it was cheap and folded up nicely for storing . However , once i used it i hated it . My newborn would slip over to the side and bump her head very easily -LRB- yes i kept at least one hand on her at all times -RRB- or be able to nearly turn completly sideways . It also is a pain to drain , most of the water comes out but leaves some water in the bottom ridge on the side opposite the plug . The only good thing about it is the storage of it . .
 I used this with kid # 2 . Even as a newborn , he seemed too big -LRB- born at 7.12 -RRB- He would slide all over even when held and even would slide down with his back ending up on the butt gap . Then cause of the folding gap , water poured out with every movement he made , no matter how little water I put in it . Also , the water level it holds -LRB- min . or max . -RRB- was so low that his poor little parts were way above the waterline . Boys tend not to like cold down there . To be wet then above the water just did n't work . I ended up using this hammock-on-a-frame type thing I got for # 1 when she was little and bathed him in a regular tub . Made it alot easier to wash his hair too since he was leaning back . I would not recommend this one to anyone . With the trouble and effort , you are better of cradling them in your arms over the tub . same amount of support/lack of water/one handedness
 CON
 We purchased this product about three weeks ago , from Wal-Mart . Tonight , when bathing out month old infant , she managed to stick her finger into the hinge on the head side folding side . It took about two minutes to free here , and the end result was some skin breakage , and swell.In general we like Safety 1st products , but now on we will double think purchasing their products .
 I used this tub for my first born . This is small and holds very little water , therefore , the water gets cold fast ! Also , there are holes where the tub folds up so the water spills out of the holes as the baby moves . It can be messy if you are giving your baby a bath on the floor as I did.Our baby would stick her foot and leg out of the tub because it 's so small ... when I used larger tub , that did n't happen.One positive thing that I can say about this product is that it 's compact ... I kept it at my mother 's house and it did n't take up much space.I would recommend spending an extra $ 10 to $ 15 and buy a higher quality tub .
 This tub has a great concept with being able to fold up - but is terrible for a newborn . There is not enough support for the baby and he or she will slip and slide all over - even if you are holding onto the baby with one hand . I threw this tub out and purchased one with a net that snaps on over top of the tub . This is MUCH better and safer since it cradles the baby while bathing . Once he or she is old enough to sit up without support , you can take the net off and use the plastic tub like a regular baby bath tub . Safety 1st also makes this kind for roughly $ 15 .
 This tub is a waste of money . I bought it this evening and I 'm returning the tub first thing tomorrow morning . Water leaks at the hinges creating a mess and a slippery , unsafe floor.Very unsatisfied with this product .
 I do not recommend this tub . The baby is in an awkward position in it , and if his head turns to the side , it is up against a jutting edge . This tub was too big for my sink , so I used it on the countertop . It only holds a couple of inches of water before it starts spilling out at the folding areas , so the baby is always cold during the bath .
 For our first baby , we were determined to stay away from the lure of cute but unnecessarily expensive baby items . This was one of the few items we did not research and we purchased this tub thinking any tub would work . We were wrong.The tub is too slippery which causes his head to endlessly roll back and forth into the corners . The slant of the tub is also meant for a larger baby which causes his head to dig into his chin which he hates . Bathtime is about bonding , so after a month and a half of fighting , we ended up taking our baths together . My son prefered the skin to skin contact anyways.The tub is also a poor fit for any oval sink bathroom , and the one time I put it in the kitchen sink I filled it with water and it buckled . Never tried it again . If you want to wash your baby in the sink , get a foam sponge or a bath support specifically made for newborns.Even for 12 dollars I would not buy this tub again . Granted it might work for some , but if you have a fussy or even mildly fussy baby I would not recommend this tub .
 Hmmm ... thre 's no way our newborn could stay safe in this , there 's not support . Another baby product gone unused .
 This is a great idea but with several problems . We bought the tub for our newborn and he loved it . However , now he is 10 weeks old , the tub is too small -LRB- our baby is n't very big -RRB- . The folding mechanism is problematic on 2 counts :1 . The baby can -LRB- and ours did -RRB- get fingers and / or toes caught where the tub folds . This is scary for both the baby and parent and is potentially very dangerous . Thankfully our baby was n't hurt , just frightened .2 . Because of the way it folds , the tub can hold only a little water without it spilling out all over the floor . I do n't mind this too much , but it does make bath time very messy and with a new baby , no-one needs anything extra to clean up.Because of the safety & size issues , we are searching for another tub and are disappointed that we wasted time and money on this one . Although it saves space , I would in future , buy an inflatable tub -LRB- which can also be used as a sled , apparently -RRB- . PLEASE take extra care with your little one 's fingers and toes if you buy this tub , but do think very carefully about other alternatives .
 The pro 's of this tub are : * It is inexpensive . * It is very compact and folds up small enough to fit in a small space . If space is an issue , this tub is great.The con 's of this tub are : * My baby -LRB- 9 weeks old -RRB- loves to kick when she is bathing . Her little feet get caught in the space where the tub folds . This is a significant safety concern . * You ca n't fill the tub very much with water . The water leaks out of the joints where the tub folds . It can get quite messy!If you have storage problems , I would recommend purchasing this tub . However , the mess of water all over and her little feet getting jammed in the joint space do not make this tub a recommended item . We will be purchasing a new tub soon .
 This tub was great in the beginning - it fit perfectly in our kitchen sink and we were able to bathe our baby with no problems at all . It was great that she could sit in the warm water and not get cold while I was washing her , etc.However , after using the tub about 10 times , it suddenly collapsed into the bottom of the sink with my baby inside . Basically , the top and bottom ends that fold up for storage just buckled . She was n't hurt , but was very scared . Keep in mind that this problem started when my baby was 12 lbs - so I do n't think her weight was an issue .
 This tub sounds ideal but it 's not . For one , there are areas where the tub folds where your child can get his/her toes caught and stuck , very unsafe . Also , if you put it over a sink , you can only put so much water in before the weight is to heavy and the folded parts fold in and as your baby grows he will get to heavy to put this tub over the sink as the ends will fold in.My son is now 4 months and we are going to purchase another tub . I dread each time I have to use this tub , especically because of the folds your baby 's toes can get caught in .
 This is just cheap oil with fragrance added . A sharpie pen written on bottle for scent added . No seal on cap . Oil smells bad on outside of bottle . Greasy and not good quality oil . Can buy your own oil and add scent yourself .
 The front of the bottle says 130 mg . The back of the bottle says 130 mg `` as DMAE bitartrate '' not `` from 351 mg DMAE bitartrate '' . This means that you are really only receiving 48 mg of DMAE . A purposeful deception because another brand is offering 130 mg of actual DMAE .
 I saw no health improvements whatsoever . Like taking a placebo , save your money . Eat clean and get in some daily exercise .
 The reason why I gave it a 1 because it gave me the worse menstral cramps , and I was in pain for a week . I do n't recommend this product !!
 Gave me headaches every day for a couple weeks . I stopped using it and the headaches went away . Over all , it 's not for me .
 After taking this product for 3 weeks , there was no change in my hotflashes . I do know it can take some time to get into your system , however not this long . I read numerous reviews prior to ordering the product which were good . Sadly , I see no change !
 I really did n't notice any difference . I did order Green Coffee Bean Extract and noticed a real difference . For weight loss , pre-menopausal , this would not be my choice for weight loss : -LRB-
 Title reads
 I tried using this product for menopause symptoms supposedly caused by estrogen domininance . I started out with one capsule and did n't notice any difference in the way I was feeling , so I added a second capsule and all it did was give me extrememly bad trapped gas pain , escpecially if I took it with my dinner . I 'm guessing it 's because it 's made with so many cruciferous vegetables . Sadly , I have n't found this product to be of any help to me .
 Not really sure if 's working or not . I 'll keep taking until I run out . I may update later on if things change .
 I thought this would help with , what I think , is an excess of estrogen in my body . Unfortunately , this made me so over emotional , when nearing my time of the month - I was a wreck ! Crying for no reason at all . My periods did seem easier . But not worth the extra emotions .
 I have tried this product for fibroids and for the past 3 weeks I have not seen any improvements . I would not recommed this product . I am now leaning to strong changes in diet and fasting instead of pills . I seemed to have more pain and disconfort than before .
 I read about this possibly helping bring your cycle back if you 're not regular . I used up the whole bottle and never got a cycle with this . That is all I used it for .
 This product is not all natural . . it has jucky gelatin in it ... What is gelatin ? Gelatin is protein obtained by boiling skin , tendons , ligaments , and/or bones with water . It is usually obtained from cows or pigs .
 Its good for hormones , but when my cycle comes , I have extremely bad menstrual cramps ! I would recommend for people who have unbalance hormones
 I took this product as recomended for a month and honestly did not notice any difference in anything . Some people reported using it longer to feel the effects so I took it for another month and still did not notice any difference .
 This brand is not as good as another brand I tried . It 's not as concentrated and does n't have that right cherry flavor . I 'll go back to the other when this is gone .
 I do n't take this on a regulare basis , but when I had a flare up this product did n't help at all . I ended up having to usew another Black Cherry juice , that was n't a concentrate , that I purchased from a local Grocery store to releave the pain .
 The bottle says `` 100 % pure '' , and `` Ingredients
 It 's really annoying I tried to order one of the four was completely smashed , this finisher shipping long reader 's products also come in crush one too in the annoying breaking down the deserted Street and Arthur return to eat the rest .
 This tastes very much like cherry flavored cough syrup . A few drips of vanilla extract -LRB- maybe 1/2 tsp per bottle -RRB- completes the illusion .
 They are as thin as gauze and spit-up runs right though them . The edges are finished with some kind of cheap polyester felt that lacks any absorbency and frays easily . The Gerber cloths shrank so much that I ca n't possibly use them as diapers even if I tried .
 I purchased these in the hopes they would work for our newborn . Unfortunately , I have n't even given birth yet and I already know they 're not going to hold up to the demands of a newborn wetting even once in them.The pros
 The can never be used as DIAPERS ! They are cheese cloth . In fact they may have more holes than cheese cloth does . There is no way that these diapers will hold anything that they are going to need to hold . Do n't waste your money .
 this looks like a gauze or cheesecloth ! you can see thru it . these are not made with birdseye - check out my photo to see the difference .
 I have 2 dozen of these that I was going to use as `` back up '' diapers for my cloth stash . After one wash and dry they were too small to use . Not worth a penny in terms of diapers but great burp cloths and dust rags .
 These are not the diapers I remember . In fact , you could not possibly use them as diapers - they are very very thin and even when folded would not hold in what needs to be contained . Obviously the company has changed the material they use in this product . I 'm not sure why.They are however great for putting on your shoulder when burping your baby . Great for wiping up spit-up and drool . Great for tying around a toddler if you do n't have a bib handy . And great to have in the car for spills . They are also okay for dusting furniture.Wish they were diapers though - since that is why I bought them .
 I just want to start of saying that I had purchased these with the intent of cloth diapering my baby . I had used Gerber flatfolds and prefolds on my first two children back in 2000 and 2002 . They were amazingly awesome back in the day , so I 'm wondering what on earth happened.These are very thin ... I mean see through thin . I could n't even use them as a changing , shoulder or lap pad in a pinch . Any baby `` mishap '' would immediately seep through . Not only that , they feel very rough - not something you 'd want to rub on a newborn baby 's skin to clean spit-up or drool.I feel bad for giving such a poor review because I 'm normally a huge fan of Gerber products . I just think that these are pointless and a waste of money . You can find better flatfolds for nearly the same price as these . As far as burp cloths , the Gerber prefold diapers work awesome for those .
 I 've never written a review on amazon before but these were so disappointing I felt obligated on these . The `` diapers '' are basically fabric so thin my mom thought it was cheesecloth . Do n't get these !!!
 I ordered these with the expectation that the fabric would be a quality , tight birdseye weave . They are instead a flimsy gauze with poorly finished edges . I washed them three times and they are still not soft as I would expect . Gerber should be ashamed .
 I read the reviews and was prepared for these to be thin . But `` thin '' is an understatement . They 're more like sheer curtains . They do n't absorb anything because there is n't enough cloth . I thought about folding them up and using them as burb clothes , but they 're too rough for infants . Do n't waste your money .
 I really thought the brand name of Gerber and or Birdseye would make quality products . Years ago when my child was young and I used cloth diapers instead of disposable ones , I could count on this brand , along with other brands . Cloth diapers were so much more comfortable for my baby , with no sweaty and painful rashes as many babies get from disposable diapers.However , when I received this order and opened it - I was amazed at how much sizing was in the fabric , how rough they were , and maybe most of all , how very thin they are . Some of them are hardly thicker than gauze . Parts of a diaper may be much thinner than other parts of the same diaper , although none was thick enough to be adequate . I kept them because I hate returning things and I hoped washing them over and over might make them softer so I could find some use for them . So far I 've washed them many times , and put white vinegar in the last rinse of some of the washes . The vinegar helps to remove excess soap . All that washing and rinsing , even in vinegar rinse , did not make the diapers any softer . I ca n't think of anything to use them for now . Perhaps as a ` rag ' to wipe up excess paint or varnish ? I could have made rags from old soft clothing that was ready to discard , and it would have been much cheaper than these diapers.I do not advise anyone buying these diapers to use on a baby or even to use as a burp cloth ; they are not thick enough for a burp cloth , even folded over several times . And if you want to use them for other purposes , such as dusting , just think if it matters to you if tiny scratches are left behind when you dust with these diapers . I am very disappointed in a brand name such as Gerber putting out such a flimsy and sleazy product .
 These are just too thin to be used as diapers . They are also a strange shape which makes them difficult to fold to be used as diapers . I do n't use them . They are just sitting in a drawer . I think I will try to use them as burp cloths as they are useless to me right now .
 Buying diapers again after 27 years , as a grandmother , I was disappointed . I expected a soft cloth . These are not what I was expecting . I recall the large single ply diapers that were excellent for everythin and also the prefilded ones that were as soft as a cloud . These are rather flimsy but I guess for a lap pad they will work .
 I bought these to use for cleaning eye glass lenses but that are sooooo rough I 'm afraid they will scratch the lens . They are thin , rough and very odd shaped . I certainly would n't use these for a baby-even as aspit up rag !!!
 I just received these as a gift and will be returning them . I had intended to use them as burp cloths , but they are way too thin and not absorbent at all ! You can see right through them . Plus , the fabric is really scratchy . Not at all what I was expecting .
 I 'm not sure how other people can give these a good review , or maybe I do n't know what they 're supposed to be used for ? Certainly not diapers ! My mother recommended that I get some flatfold cloth diapers just for cleaning up messes , using for burp pads , etc. . The ones she meant were the cushioned ones , however . These are the consistency of cheesecloth - I mean like , see-through ! I 'm returning immediately .
 These are fine for what I bought them for , burp clothes , etc. . But I ca n't imagine anyone being able to use these as actual diapers . They feel as thin as cheese cloth . They also got even flimsier after the first wash .
 We decided to try these cloth diapers as burp clothes since friends told us it 's not worth paying the premium on burp cloths . I just washed these Gerber ones for the first time and they came out of the washer/dryer wrinkled , tattered looking . The fabric/yarn from all four corners pulled out so I had to take a scissor to trim them off . I imagine the next time we put them in the washer , the fabric will just keep pulling out . What a disappointment ! The material is extermely , key word , extremely thin . I do n't see how these could hold up anything if used as a diaper . The material feels really rough . When we use it as a burp cloths I have to fold it 3 times to make it a little thicker and absorbant otherwise it just leaks right through.Unfortunately I already washed all 12 and ca n't return them . I am going to just pay the higher premium for real thicker , softer burp cloths .
 I bought these diapers to use as dish towels since I had been using old birdseye diapers this way for many years because they are soft , smooth and very absorbent . They also tolerate being bleached every week . These that I got from Gerber were horrible quality fabric , rough , uneven , thin and the machine hems are uneven and ugly . These are no better than cheese cloth rags . I wish I knew where to get the real thing .
 These are nothing more than pieces of cheesecloth , with sewn edges to prevent fraying . I have posted the picture to clearly show how unbelievably thin they really are . I ca n't think of anything other than squeezing the water out of cheese that I would be able to use these for . You can see right through the mesh material , so I would n't even think of blowing my nose , let alone diapering a baby , or chancing a good shirt on spit-ups with these useless see-through , cheesecloth squares . I 'm completely baffled by the number of good reviews these , and similar Gerber cloth diapers get . It is as if the good reviewers have a different product for which they are writing a review for . I suggest shopping in person for cloth diapers , so you can actually see , and feel the material with your own eyes , before buying them .
 These are cheap and terrible . When I washed them before use , they nearly fell apart ! Little pieces are coming off . I would never use these for burp cloths ; the baby could choke on the pieces.Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White
 I bought these for use as burp cloths with my first three children , the last in 2007 . They were fantastic . After the boys outgrew the need for burp cloths , they still liked to sleep with them , they were so soft.I recently bought another package in anticipation of our 4th baby , and I could not be more disappointed . They are 2/3 the size of the originals . The edges are serged - and not very carefully - instead of finished . The fabric is rough , even after washing . I have searched for a better alternative with no luck.I do n't know what caused Gerber to alter the quality of their product , but I am one very disappointed customer . I will not be recommending them to anyone .
 These are the least expensive and what my mom raised us on -- but NOT . The negative reviews of this product are quite true . -LRB- Wish I had listened -RRB- . I thought if I washed these on hot 4-5 times as some have suggested , they would turn into what I remember my younger sibling having . Nope -- ca n't tell you how much water and electricity I have wasted and they are still gauze . They come out of the drier looking like the tissue you forgot to remove from your pocket . I found myself trying to iron them back into a square ; rediculous and difficult.They are absorbent , but lack substance while still being bulky . In other words not much capacity . Not easy to fold in the shape they turn into . Not even worth using for a burp cloth -LRB- which the old Gerber ones were great for -RRB- -- your shoulder will get wet . These are NOT what Gerber used to make -LRB- sadly -RRB- . See OsoCozy for a true birdseye flat fold -- even better than what Gerber used to produce .
 Made in China crap ... NOT made in the usa . Typical Gerber lies . Yes I know , got sucked into ordering and Chinese crap showed up ... who knows what chemicals it 's tainted with . Look someplace else if you want made in the USA and expect a quality product .
 We are beginning to try cloth diaper systems and started with these as a first pass , as they were among the cheapest and best selling . I would not recommend them , as they lack the absorbance , softness , and durability I am looking for . In short , it 's very cheap cloth and may be useful when double or tripled up for alternative uses . We will continue to use these only as a backup . I much prefer a natural cotton trifold diaper that we bought at a local store . It 's twice the price but 10-times the quality .
 I purchased these cloth diapers to use as a liner on the changing station of my pack & play . They are very thin , so I have to double them up and then fold them in half . They are absorbent -LRB- I have twin boys , so we have our share of accidents during diaper changes -RRB- . Another reason that I 'm not crazy about them is that I need to wash them by themselves ; they release a TON of lint that gets all over the other items in a shared load . All in all , I would not purchase these again .
 Stay away . These are as thin as gauzy receiving blankets . At least get the 3-ply ones Gerber sells . Even those are n't great , but they have to be better than these .
 After washing/drying in HE machine these they shrunk sooooo much after using them and washing/drying them over and over again they shrunk even more , these are the ugliest flats i had to buy green mountains flat which are a couple cents more there huge ! did ` nt shrink like the gerbers and we use them for everything including diapering ! ... pass the gerbers they STINK !!!!! Okay okay i must admit i talked to much ... these are great for cleaning up everything your kiddos spill , i now have grown to love them , i use them as i would paper towels ... lol .
 The product name is known forever but the flat diapers were way too thin for what I needed . The price was reasonable but much too thin . OK for polishing , cleaning , etc but not for my creations .
 Yep , flat diapers are indispensible for baby . But skip the Gerbers!I 'd decided to cloth diaper , and got some fantastic -LRB- big , thick , soft -RRB- birdseye flats for $ 12 per dozen , online -LRB- Google flat diapers -RRB- . At the shower I was given some of these , and I thought `` cool , some cheapies for the non-diapering situations . `` I was shocked to find they 're not that cheap , and even more shocked at the -LRB- lack of -RRB- quality . After 5 weeks , these are still sitting untouched on the shelf , even though my tendency to grab my `` diapering diapers '' for everything has me running short on diapers a lot !
 I bought these with the sole intent of using them as burp cloths , since many other reviews have suggested this use . When I opened the package I was shocked at how thin the material is . I can actually see clearly through them ! They also do n't retain their shape at all after one washing.I was n't upset at first because I knew I was not planning on using them as diapers . However , I folded the `` diaper '' in half to use as a burp cloth and the spit up leaked right through ! Are you kidding me?I am irritated enough to have wasted money on not-so-great burp cloths ... but I think it is terrible that Gerber uses the word diaper on the label . There is NO WAY these could be used as a diaper ! The material is like cheesecloth !
 They took time figuring out how I could best use them . Meanwhile he 's soiling everything up around him before I could get it folded and refolded because the diaper is so big
 I gave these one star because I think they are unsuitable for the intended use as a cloth diaper . I bought these thinking they were comparable to the prefold cloth diapers that I have used as burp cloths in the past ... . you should be aware that they are very , very thin . They are so thin that they are transparent . Even when I folded them they did n't seem half as thick and absorbant as the prefolds . The prefold diapers are much more suitable for cloth diapering and burp cloth use ... spend the extra $ $ $ on them . These probably will make nice rags for cleaning ... . but I definitely do n't recommend them as diapers or burp cloths .
 Bought these on sale at Babies RUS . Well , now I know why they are so frequently on sale . The cloth is too thin and flimsy to use as diapers or burp cloths , and even worse , the material sheds little fibers constantly into the air . I had to wash an entire load of laundry again because all the fibers from these diapers got onto them , . They shed even after they are washed and dried.Terrible quality !
 This fabric is NOT birdseye - it 's actually a flimsy gauze.Real birdseye cloth has a TIGHT weave . Gauze is very loosely woven - exactly like the cloth these so-called diapers are made of.This product is being falsely advertised , and I 'm really mad.The only thing that this cloth has in common with real birdseye cloth is that they pressed the gauze to appear as though it has a diamond weave - which it does not.One other thing
 These diapers are so poorly made that pieces come off if they are washed , and cling to all of the other clothes . The seams are not finished in many of the diapers . I just wanted some soft cloths to use for dusting , but got the worst rags I ever saw . The manufacturer should be ashamed . I assume that they were made in some down-trodden part of the world , because no one in America would let them out of their door .
 In 2006 , I bought a dozen of the Gerber flat diapers . I liked them . They were a good weave , strong twist cotton . However , I went back to purchase more later and was sadly disappointed . The company had changed the fabric , weave , and how they were made . The old ones had a woven selvage and were serged on the ends with a soft thread . The new ones were serged all around , and used a different thread that was not soft . I returned the new ones , and wore out my old ones . A couple of times a year I open a package in the store to see if they are any different , but have not seen any positive changes.For anyone who wants to use them as rags or light towels , they may be just fine , but for diapers , they are nothing compared to the older ones.I also tried the prefolds with the `` absorbent '' middle . I finally cut one open after finding they would not hold even one ounce of liquid -LRB- lay diaper in colander , over a large bowl , pour one ounce water onto diaper , then measure what falls into the bowl -RRB- and discovered that they are filled with polyester batting . The batting makes them soft and puffy , but polyester does not absorb liquid.If you want flat diapers , look online for Indian or Chinese flats , or , maybe even something made in the USA ! Same with prefolds . Gerber makes good pins and nice baby clothes , but do n't waste time and money on their cloth diapers .
 I registered for these diapers and was very disappointed . I wish I would have gotten another kind . These have been washed only a few times and not even dryed in the dryer . These have all kinds of pilling and strings coming apart . I do n't think these will last very long . Save yourself the money and buy regular burp cloths or another type of diaper .
 Whether you are using these diapers for diapering or for burp cloths , I suggest you look at the version with the padded absorbent center . This version is too thin to serve as either a burp cloth or for diapering . However , the same brand , with the absorbent center pad , is much better .
 i am very disappointed with these diapers . they are very thin . i purchased these with the intention to use as burp clothes . now i will have to spend twice .
 I have experience with other brands of flat diaper cloths . I needed more , so I bought a pack of Gerbers and I was very disappointed . They are as thin as gauze and spit-up runs right though them . The edges are finished with some kind of cheap polyester felt that lacks any absorbency and frays easily . The Gerber cloths shrank so much that I ca n't possibly use them as diapers even if I tried.If these were named `` utility cloths , '' I could understand . But calling them diapers is a joke . Gerber used to be known for quality , but these are junk .
 I 'm disappointed with this cleaning cloth . Everytime I rub my sunglasses , it leaves lint all over . It 's not soft either , Do n't buy !
 These cloths were not what I expected . I was hoping for a little more fiber than micro . . I would n't purchase these again .
 I bought several of these to clean my glasses and shiny electronics such as my cell phone and computer . They are not as soft as what you would get at an optical or glasses shop - they have a very finished feel to them , more like polyester , less like silk . I think they may have even put slight scratches on my cell phone . Tried two different clothes . Unfortunately , not recommended , even though the company was very helpful and shipped fast .
 I have bought many microfiber cloths for all sorts of things . These cloths do not feel like the microfiber I have used in the past . I got new eyeglasses , and got these for that reason . I would n't dare use these on them . I threw it out as soon as I felt them ...
 no puedo realisar una opinion de este articulo ya que fue el unico que no resivi de la compra que realise ese dia
 I always have lower back pain when I sit too long at work but usually , the pain disappears after work . However , after using this during the first day , my lower back pain was way worse than usual , and the pain lingered even after work . Tried it for another day and had the same very bad feeling . I bought this product because of the good reviews but maybe it is not really what it is . Have to return it ... I am really disappointed because I thought that I have found a solution to my back problem .
 I would not recomend this cushion , uncomfortable over time , delays the pain of no cushion for about 10 minutes . The price is too high relative to the comfort or quality of the cushion , very disappointed in the product .
 The cushion was harder than I am looking for and the cut out is huge . I may be good for a heavier person but not for me . I sent it back .
 I suffer from rear and and leg pain when sitting . If you feel the same , do n't get this ! For spinal back pain , I can see where this might help . Gave it away and settled for some high density memory foam that does n't bottom out !
 So , I 'm suffering from a broken tailbone that will not heal.I tried this cushion , but it was too thick to use in the car . It placed me uncomfortably tall in the seat . I 'm a tall person , so it might work fine for some one who is short or has a short torso.What I found works much better is a a foam roll on in the small of my back . My doctor told me that having this to keep me erect in a seat or a chair would keep pressure off the tailbone . It has helped a great deal on long trips .
 This has a substantial forward pitch to the seat , and it is very hard . I found it uncomfortable and could not get used to it .
 The discritption does n't say Extra Firm -LRB- like a board -RRB- . I returned it and will buy my next ons again a Bookstone if they still sell them after 4 years .
 UNDERSIZED - TOO SMALL FOR TRANSFER CHAIR , NOT RESILIENT ENOUGH TO AFFORD COMFORT OVER THE LONG HAUL . -LRB- 1 HOUR OR MORE -RRB-
 Cushion had small tear on one side . I did keep the cushion and cover the tear with electrical tape to keep it from running . Wish it had a washable cover . The cushon is excellent just a flaw in this particular one .
 I have the sore butt and back problem that prompts one to buy this kind of product . I have tried this pillow and the doughnut shaped pillow -LRB- with a cloth cover to conceal the doughnut shape , though it is still obvious -RRB- and the doughnut is definitely superior .
 these are disgusting . do not buy unless you want 24 energy bars that you wont want to eat
 This does n't smell ANYTHING like the Sweet Almond I have smelled before . It smells like rancid olive oil with a hint of eucalyptus . Very disappointing . Do n't waste your time or money .
 I agree with the first reviewer . I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this product . My daughter also wets on the pad between the old diaper and the new one and so we had to purchase a solid changing pad to avoid wet spots on our bed . The problem with the product is that it has stitching between the quilted areas and they must use a big needle because there are stitch holes that allow wetness to just leak right through . I want my money back !!
 This is definitely not waterproof . Potty goes right into the quilting . The first time my daughter piddled on it was the last time we used it . I tried to clean it and never could get the potty smell out of it . It needs to be solid and not quilted . Not worth buying .
 I bought this pad thinking it would be waterproof since it is vinyl , not a chance ! My daughter has timed her diaper changes such that she has had accidents after the diaper is off . To my surprise the pad leaked thru ! What a disappointment , save your money on this one !
 The zombie flavor is just gross . The chap stuck its selfs is smooth and nice but I could n't get over the smell of this flavor .
 It does n't taste or smell like Grand Marnier I was very disappointed . I would rather have my chapstick in cherry flavor . Atleast It has a taste .
 Piece of junk , it had a hole in it and piss went all over the bed . Do not recommend to anyone .
 I am sorry , but I can not share the enthusiasm for this product . The readings are innacurate - several readings taken at short intervalls showed deviations of up to 2.5 degrees . To prove this , I repeated the test on myself with the same results . This is very critical since most doctors recommend a visit to the emergency room if the child 's temperature exceeds 105 . With this thermometer there is - at least for me - no accurate way of telling.In addition , the button that activates the reading process gets stuck a lot , thereby producing no result at all . I finally replaced it with a professional model , the same kind that doctors use . Expensive , but worth it.I am usually a fan Of Braun products . Not this one !
 As the subject said . I was hoping to get the product pictured as it is superior in every way to the inferior replacement 51S . The description also says `` Braun 8000 Activator Combi-Pack Foil and Cutterblock '' which is also incorrect . Everything about this listing is wrong , and you should not buy this.For what it 's worth , you can probably get it cheaper from someone else if you want the 51S , by the way.I always ignore reviews when people shout `` DO NOT BUY '' , but I 'm now writing one . BUYER BEWARE . DO NOT BUY . I ca n't believe Amazon lets this go on .
 I bought this razor believing it was one of the best for my husband who has had a massive stroke . The blade had to be replaced after a very short time and the replacement purchased here was worse than the original one .
 I was very disappointed that the foil part of the shaver got a hole in it less than two weeks after he replaced it . The last foil he put on lasted around a year .
 Was not the item pictured on this page . Fits but does not shave as well as the correct model . Avoid !
 This is the worst replacement I 've ever purchased for a product I own . I have been a happy 8585 owner for years , with the razor and its replaceable parts provider the best shave I 've ever had . This new horrible replacement block has torn up my face and made shaving a nightmare . I 'm trying the 7000 replacement as advised here . Braun made a terrible mistake . I do n't know how I could trust them again .
 I 've had a Braun 8585 for years ... got this to replace the cutter and foil . I found the shave quality decreased and the blades started pulling whiskers . Also I was nicked more often.I finally replaced the cutter and foil on my 8585 with this : Braun Series 3 Combi 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack -LRB- Formerly 4700,7000 -RRB- . It fits perfectly and gives me an excellent shave . No more pulling , no nicks , and a closer shave . Definitely the way to renew an 8000-series razor.Avoid this foil and cutterblock !
 I wanted the exact item pictured , instead I was sent Braun 's replacement for this item . The description matches but the part number and UPC 's are different from the item listed . The new and improved pack does not work as good on my razor . I know this because I have already bought two of them this makes the third . It is not worth the hassle to send it back unless Buy It Now sends me a preaddressed package to send it back in.Picture , all product ID information needs to be updated .
 Replacement parts went together easy just like original . Wore hole in foil upon first cleaning . Product was complete disappointment .
 My foil lasted approximatly 6 weeks before developing a hole . Thereafter , I cut my face whenever I tried to use the razor . After a few attempts , I understood the price of a new foil was less than the expected doctor 's bills if I kept slicing my face . I called Braun Customer Service and reported the problem . They were friendly and offered to send a new cutter block . Within 1 week they had done as promised and even followed up with a letter . Great service , but I hope the new one lasts a bit longer as I very much like the razor . By the way , if you have this problem the number for Customer Service is
 The cutting block is no longer a thick piece of metal . It is another foil against the outer foil . When I opened the package 10 months ago and noticed this , I was already concerned . I 've had 10 months now to review it , and the change is not for the better . The cutter is already worn , and it gets `` caught '' sometimes , and sounds like it 's about to give me razor burn . It 's also hard for me to get a close shave compared to the original . I 'm looking to change my daily shaver because of this bait and switch ! This one will be relegated to travel duty . Shame on Braun . I 'll be looking for a different company 's shaver .
 This is an expensive foil and should last more than three months . With out notice you feel cuts and see that the foil has a small hole and jagged edge that cuts .
 I have used the 8585 model for about 4 or 5 years now . I have replaced the cutter and foil several times . Each time the result was the same as a newly purchased razor . However , the last replacement foil and cutter , which came from Goodman 's , provided a shave which felt mostly like using a serrated edged rusty knife . It appears , by visual inspection , the cutter has been redesigned . The cutter now appears as if the individual cutting elements are wider and not thin blades as in the past . Consequently , the experience is pure torture . The order through Amazom expressly identifies the Braun Activator 8585 series . I was sent the 8000 Series product , which indicates it is for the `` Series 5 . '' When I questioned Goodman 's about the difference , they simply stated that it was the same product had been `` modified . '' This is no longer the product I have used and respected . It is a piece of junk not worthy of Amazon 's endorsement , as neither is Goodman 's .
 When I emailed Shaver Outlet about this , they replied : I am sorry for the confusion . We are a repair centrer and order many parts in bulk . The parts you received are the exact same parts as the packaged items but without the wasteful retail packaging.I would have preferred the `` wasteful retail packaging '' since it was shown in the picture . For all I know , they could have sent out refurbed crap . DO N'T SHOW ONE THING AND SHIP ANOTHER !
 I do n't have good things to say about this item I purchased as what I ordered and what I was given by the seller are two different things . When I challenged the seller on this matter , they told me that the item is no longer manufactured . Yet , they adverised it on Amazon ! If they do n't have the item to sell , then you should n't be listing it on Amazon ...
 I 've had my Braun shaver for about 3 years now . Each year I always buy the replacement foil/cutter parts.Recently I purchased the foil/cutter parts . I 'm actually shocked that after only a few weeks and not shaving everyday , that the foil part is already broken . In other words , a piece of the metal on the foil is sticking up making it impossible to shave with .
 I purchased a replacement for my Braun three months ago after the original mesh broke and started cutting my face . Guess what , the replacement head is now broken as well . I guess I will buy the third one and start treating this as a more fragile item , but this is definitely not what I expected when paying for a high-end shaver .
 I would give this foil/cutter zero stars if possible . I took another reviewers advice and bought the Braun 7000 Series Syncro Pro/Syncro Replacement Combo and it delivered a very nice shave . This replacement pulled whiskers and was a very bad shave . Braun should be ashamed of themselves for selling such junk .
 Am I the only one having this problem ? These foils are n't lasting me more than a few months . And , no , I do n't push the razor hard against my face , I use it at a 90 degree angle , and I do n't have an abnormally thick beard . I 've used Braun razors my whole life and for some reason my 8595 goes through foils like nothing else . I 've even had the entire cutter unit -LRB- motor -RRB- replaced under warrenty just in case that was the problem . Personally I think the problem is in the design of the foil as the thinner mesh just is n't as strong as the previous design . Is anyone else having this same experience ? Is the newer 360 model any better ?
 I ca n't review the 8100 foil & cutter since , although that is what I ordered , I received the inferior 51S replacementAnd at full price , not the one advertised for the 51S . Not much point in returning it if I have to pay more toShip it back & possibly getting a restock charge . I dislike false advertising and bait & switch . And the email shownOn the packing list was totally bogus , too .
 This product was as dull as my 1 year old cutter block ! Vendor was fantastic but I think he needs to review his supplier -LRB- from China -RRB- .
 I have owned a Braun 8585 series electric shaver since 2007 . It is the BEST shaver I have ever owned . I have been using replacement Blades from Braun and from Amazon every year since I purchased this shaver.I purchased replacement blades this year , as I always do , once a year . I was sent 5 series blades . At first I thought it was a mistake , but they fit my shaver.I have now been using these blades for less than 4 months and they are DULL , DULL , DULL . They do NOT shave like blades I 've received in the past and it is becoming a TORTURE DEVICE.I now have to spend 20 + minutes every morning shaving to get the desired results and my skin is left red and tender every day . The blades pull my beard and it is painful.I do n't know if the quality of the blades has been compromised , but I have to tell you , I have to replace these blades in less than 6 months of use and THAT is NOT right.I would be hesitant to order these blades . They do not last long .
 As other folks have already mentioned , you will not get the Braun 8000 Activator foil package but the Braun 51S , which the replacement.I failed to read the reviews and ordered because I thought I 'll get the original 8000 foil , as the add and image showed . To my disapointment , I was sent 51S . The seller refunded my $ $ $ so all I lost was time dealing with the seller.So if you really want the 8000 , do n't bother as you will not get it .
 My order was placed with AmazonI received myModel 8595 foil and cutter block yesterday . The original ones that came with the razor had an imprint of Activator . Not so , this one !!! If you have a tender skin , then best switch to another brand of razor . My intentions are just that . Two shaves and my face feels burned and the shaves were not close at all.Up to now , I have enjoyed this razor.Six years of great shaves . It has been pricey but worth it . All finished for me now .
 To be fair , I have not tried this replacement product , but I would recommend carefully checking out all the reviews here on Amazon . One or two negative reviews can be expected with any high volume product , but this replacement foil seems to be a poor substitute . Given the high volume demand for the original , Braun should have had no reason to discontinue the original . In fact , when I contacted them regarding their reasoning , they referred me to a vendor who supposedly still carried the original but in fact does not .
 This did not change my shave much at all . I should not have spent the money . I thought it would make the shaver like it was when it was brand new . Sadly this was not the case .
 I had the same experience as the fellow who wrote the July '06 review . I ordered the part in the first week of May '06 to only have it delayed 3 times for shipment . I just got another delay notice from Amazon today , July 10 . At this rate they 'll never ship the item.If they ca n't ship , why in the world do they list this item ??? UPDATE
 I have ordered this item several times . All I recieve is that the item is being delayed for shipment . After several times of this I cancel the shipment . Had to do this several times .
 This is NOT the Braun 8000FC as indicated by the picture and on the invoice -LRB- if you buy -RRB- . This is Braun 's replacement # 51S and it SUCKS ! The cutter blade design has changed and it does not shave anywhere near as clean as the older design . I 'd purchased these hoping to get the original design but was shipped the 51S . Just know and understand what you 'll be receiving if you choose to buy !
 For those of you -LRB- like me -RRB- who have noticed a significant decline in the Braun Activator replacement blades , I decided to take one for the team and try and see if the Braun 7000 Series Syncro Pro / Syncro Replacement Combo would work in my Activator . The fit is perfect , and the blade style is of the thinner variety formerly used in the Activator . I had an immediate improvement in shave closeness -- with none of the hair pulling of my old replacement blade . If you own an Activator and you 're about to toss it out because of the terrible quality of these replacement blades , you might want to search for `` Braun 7000 Series Syncro Pro / Syncro Replacement Combo '' and try my route first . Hope this is helpful .
 If you 've been reading any of the reviews here lately you will know the 8000 series foil/cutterblock combo has been replaced with a new combo now called the series 5 Combi 51S . You will receive this replacement even if the picture on the product page shows `` 8000 series '' as it has been discontinued for over a year . Braun merged the replacement for the 8000 series -LRB- Activator -RRB- with the 360 Complete . This new foil/cutterblock is garbage ! The cutterblock has wide blades , as opposed to the thinner blades of the original 8000 series , which pull your stubble and take MANY passes over your face to shave . They are prone to premature failure and I have gone through 3 -LRB- THREE -RRB- of these in 6 months ! -LRB- I bought one and two were free through Braun after complaining -RRB- . All the free replacements in the world were n't making the shaving experience any better . I longed for the days when my Activator 8595 cut smooth , close , and comfortably . After all , this shaver had been my favorite for 6 years so far ! I was very close to dumping the whole shaver and moving on when I happened across a reviewer on Amazon who suggested using the 7000 series replacement foil/cutterblock in his review . It worked PERFECTLY ! The 7000 series replacement looks just like the much coveted original on my 8595 Activator - down to the thinner cutting blades ! It did n't pull my stubble , it cut smooth as butter , and was comfortable
 My son has been using the Braun 8595 for several years , which afforded him a comfortable shave , and we used the replacement foil and cutter `` 8000 Series '' Activator during the past years , which was a perfect fit and replacement , like the original . Braun apparently discontinued this foil cutter block , and the new one caused my son great pain and discomfort during his shave ! I had to go out and buy him an entire new system , and am going to try to return the unused , and hopefully the slightly used foil and cutter . The REPLACEMENT foil and cutter says
 I believe Braun has changed the way they make the new replacement cutters and foil heads for the 8000 series razors . The older ones had grey plastic clips on the ends and the new ones have black . I have purchased three new sets in four months and all three have lost a clip off of the end . This causes the foils to vibrate . It is a very noticable change in the sound when turned on and the quality of shave is greatly reduced . I have used this razor for three years and never had this problem . I used the last replacement head two times before it broke .
 I never thought I 'd say anything bad about my Braun 8585 shaver , but the replacement foils and cutterblock have ruined a wonderful product.Here 's what happened ... I used my original blades and foil for 2 to 3 years . The shaver gave me a GREAT shave . Then I replaced those blades with replacement foil and cutterblock . What a mistake ! Apparently Braun was bought out by Gillette in 2005 . Gillette changed the design of the blades and moved the manufacture of them to China . Well , now blades that are supposed to last 18 months only last 2-3 months . They are HORRIBLE.I am so frustrated because it now takes me 3 times as long to shave and the results are just terrible . The shaver is cutting my face and not my hair . Yesterday , I ordered a Panasonic shaver because I ca n't afford to replace the blades every 2-3 months and get a crappy shave.I used to love this shaver . What a shame .
 The `` new and improved '' foil with Gillette technology is too fragile . They rarely last two months before they develop a hole .
 I put one tip on my crutch when I got them , about a week ago , and it has already deteriorated and fallen apart . Never have I gotten something so bad .
 The product was shipped quickly and intact . I bought the crutch tips on behalf of my uncle who frequently uses crutches . It appears that the 1st & current pair of new crutch tips he is using are wearing out rather quickly . Now to be fair , my uncle-the user of the tips , is not exactly a lightweight thus a possible ?? cause of the premature wear on the crutch tips . I really ca n't say but we are a lil disappointed as a more sturdy tip was hoped for .
 The razor gives a close shave , but I have had problems with Braun 's customer service . I have owned the razor for almost a year . After approximately six months , the lights on the charging/cleaning base would not come on and the base would not clean the razor . I called Braun and they told me which service center to send it to and gave me the number so that I could call first . I called the service center , described the symptoms and was instructed to send in the base at my expense . Well ... weeks became months with no word from Braun or the service center . I called Braun and they told me to contact the service center . I did as instructed and they told me that the base was fine and that maybe there was a problem with the razor or the charging adaptor and that I would have to send them in at my expense even though I was originally asked to send in only the base . Interestingly enough , I have been using the razor and charger without incident . I am frustrated that they have had my base for months and have not contacted me to tell me their conclusion . I will send in my razor and go back to a blade until I receive my repaired setup ; hopefully it will be back in a reasonable amount of time . Though I like the ergonomics and shave of the 8585 , I will probably not buy any more Braun products due to the poor attention Braun gives to the buyer after the sale .
 Dear Sirs , I very much appreciate the opportunity you have provided for me to comment on my new Braun Electric Shaver.I am not a perpetual complainer . This is the first time in 40 years I have submitted a written complaint about a product which I have purchased.I must say , however , that I am keenly disappointed with my Braun 8585 . It does not provide me with a clean or a close shave.Its performance is only very marginally better than my Norelco which has languished in my top drawer for more than 20 years.I am wondering whether the liquid cleaning `` device '' of the Braun is not just a gimmick -- messy , cumbersome and quite expensive to use.I sincerely apolgise for these negative comments but trust nevertheless that you will find them helpful.Respectfully submitted , Eric Sorensen , Minneapolis .
 This shaver cleans very easily , looks nice and keeps your sink clean . However , it just does n't cut close enough for me , particularly on the throat area . I have never found an electric razor that even got anywhere near as close as a blade and this is no exception . I could get it pretty damn close on my face by repeatedly jamming the razor against my face , but it would take a long time to do this . As far as the hair on my throat , there was no way at all to cut that anywhere near as close as I would have wanted . This might be the best of the few electric shavers that I tried , but still disappointing .
 I bought this as a gift for my husband based on the great reviews . He was not pleased with the shave the product gave . He said that the razor did not give him a smooth shave on his neck area and it irritated the skin . I ended up returning it .
 I purchased the Braun several months ago and last weekend I packed my old Remington 3 head and went hunting . I got a MUCH closer shave with the old razor than I did with this OVERPRICED Braun.Buying the braun was a BIG MISTAKE !!! Save your money and buy something else . I wish I knew how to return this overrated piece of junk.Jack
 I 've had the Braun 8585 for four months now . The device does not age well.Despite the use of the included cleaning / charging base , two screws under the foil screen are rusting . I 'm considering this a cosmetic problem until something actually falls apart.The main problem I have is with the cleaning / charging base . When I put the razor in the base , I have to jiggle it for several minutes to get the `` Charge '' light to come on or to get the base to determine a cleaning cycle to use.When I do get the base to start cleaning the razor , the razor always shakes lose during the same stage of the cleaning . At one point the razor turns on and begins running , and it 's at this stage that the razor shakes itself lose and disconnects . The end result is a razor that refuses to charge in the base and is n't being cleaned.My wife managed to get it to hold still for a cleaning cycle with the careful use of a Q-tip to jam the razor against the wall of the case . This is an art I 've been unable to master.While I can still charge the razor using the electrical cable , the major feature , the self cleaning functionality , is completely useless.In the end , I 'm disappointed in the razor , and have no intention of purchasing a Braun razor in the future .
 Here 's my 2 cents -LRB- take it or leave it -RRB-
 I got this unit from Amazon in early July . I opened the box , connected the charger to a regular outlet . It just exploded after 2 minutes charging and left a big black mark on the outlet . I am returning it and do n't expect any problem from Amazon . Anybody else had the same problem ?
 I bought this shaver less then 3 years ago and it just plain quit on me . Got hot during charging and motor would n't run at all . Took it to a recommended Braun repair person and he said the motor was burned out and not worth repairing . I paid over $ 150.00 for this junker and Braun gives no way to contact them on their WEB site . Have 2 much older -LRB- non-cleaning -RRB- Braun shavers and both work just fine . Repair person said this might have something to do with the wet cleaning used for this shaver ... I would n't get another Braun like this if it was free ...
 I use three razors . Last year 's model of this Braun , a triple blade rotary from the leading manufacturer of rotary razors and standard double edged disposables from the major manufacturer of razors.OK , now , let 's do some math . I get 10 great shaves from a disposable razor . I pay , on average , 40c or so for a disposable razor . That is about a nickel a shave including the shave cream . At a nickel a shave , it would take 3000 shaves before I would spend $ 150 . Would take me over 8 years.Now , anyone that says any electric razor shaves better than a double edged high quality blade razor -LRB- not even the expensive triple edged ones , just cheap disposables -RRB- is dreaming . The blace does a much better job and much faster . But , sometimes , they can irritate the skin , but electrics can too . I can get irritated by both , sooooo , I rotate between them , and find that reduces my skin irritation problem quite well.I bought this Braun -LRB- last year 's model -RRB- after reading the positive reviews here , and later bought a rotary razor . The basic difference is that the cheap model rotary from that major manufacturer is much quieter , shaves just as well , and cost me about 1/3 the price.The only thing that is better in the Braun is the battery lasts longer . It is possible also , that in some cases , it gives a slightly closer shave than the rotary , but it also tends to miss spots no matter how many times I go over them . The Braun also has a problem with my beard when it is longer , like when I have two to three days growth . The rotary and disposable razor breeze through that three day bush.The cleaning machine/charger that comes with the Braun is a joke . Yes , it cleans the razor great , but it is way oversized and you need a large space for it in your bathroom . Even then , say you have that larger space , you can pay between $ 5.00 and $ 8.00 each for the cleaning cartridges . I have found they last about a month before drying out . Add $ 60 to your annual cost to just clean your razor . The rotary cleans fine with a brush and the disposable razors with water.Finally , the switch that turns on the razor is right where you hold the razor and it also locks the blade . So I am constantly locking the blade position by accident . Inexcusable design flaw in a razor this price.Don ' t get me wrong . This razor shaves fine . It works best on short beards and works better than cheap razors . But for $ 50 you can get a better rotary razor and for $ 150 you can shave for over 8 years with a disposable twin blade . Does the price difference sound rational to you ? If it does , click `` Proceed to Order '' .
 The shavor cuts close once it finally picks up the hairs , but the hair just below the jaw line evaded capture for what seemed like ten minutes . By the time I 'd finally gotten each one I had razor burn far worse than I would with my regular razor.If it had n't been so expensive I would n't be so dissapointed . It 's really not worth the $ 150 it 's going for .
 The razor is n't bad , but the cleaning system is a joke . Mine would n't release the razor & kept recleaning it . Plus , and I am surprised that this is n't mentioned in the other reviews that I read before getting the razor , the cleaning solution -LRB- which is an expensive , printer-ink type of gimmick -RRB- stinks like metal solvent . Bottom line is this would be a decent razor if it was sold by itself without the cleaning junk for a lower price .
 The shaver is fantastic , as most of the reviewers agree . However , after two months of gentle use , the cleaning stand stopped working . Braun is telling me to send it to a repair shop but , as luck would have it , I ca n't find my receipt so I ca n't get it repaired under warrantee . Even if I could find the receipt , I would have to send the stand in at my expense.I bought this shaver because I felt I would be buying quality . I am a product designer by profession and I feel that this product is not worth the money , especially in light of their repair policy . If they were to stand behind their products , I would be fine with this failure , but , as it stands , I regret buying this shaver and I doubt I will purchase anything else from Braun .
 I agree with several reviewers that this cleaning unit is really a lot of hype and overengineering . At the time , I did not realize I would be buying replacement cartridges every 1-2 months . Cleaning shaver stubble from my rotary shavers for > 10 years has never really been a big deal . We have far more unpleasurable waste that we deal with everyday . Hey , we 're human!As far as the shaver , it can not do a good job on the neck if you have a thick new beard every morning . I am of Italian descent so take that for `` whaddits '' worth . As a test , I used my very old Norelco rotary on half my face and it blew away the Braun in direct comparison . Maybe there are foil shavers out there that are equal to rotary shavers , but this one turned me off completely to foil shavers.P.S . - I personally felt this product needed to be bashed . I am even disappointed with Costco for carrying this product in their limited selection .
 I really wanted to like this razor . Nice engineering , a clean comfortable shave , not too loud . Unfortunately , it just missed too many little hairs . I do n't think my beard is any thicker than normal , but some of the hairs can curl under a little especially on my neck . Despite the nifty screen design , the razor just could n't pick them all up no matter how many times I went over the darn things.Anyway , my advice
 I have used a blade my entire life and i bought this razor expecting that it would n't shave as close as a blade . However , i expected it to be quicker/easier with less irritation . I have a pretty heavy beard and i have sensitive skin so i thought i would try this product to get away from some of the irritation of a blade . I WAS WRONG ! It took me longer to shave with this and i had more razor burn/irritation than i do with a blade . The razor did okay on my face but on the jawlines and the neck it did n't cut a darn thing.Now after experimenting with almost everything i feel like i can tell you what the best shave is . If you want the best/quickest/least irriative/closest shave , this is what you need to do.first , the best blade is the Mach 3 Power , the other Mach 3 's will do but the Mach 3 Power is the best . I tried gillete 's new power fusion with 5 blades and it did n't even come close to the comfort and closeness of the Mach 3 Power.second , the best shaving cream is the Nivea Shaving Gel , i get the sensitive skin but any of them will do . Nivea is the thickest / creamiest lather you 'll find . -LRB- make sure you shave after the shower when your face is hot and wet -RRB-
 I hated the product and amazon does n't take it back as they say it contains alcohol and so it ca n't be shipped back to them . They had asked me to call the manufacturer for a refund.My question to Amazon is `` Why/How did sell if it was dangerous . ''
 I bought this shaver for my husband for Christmas as a luxury item because he hates shaving but it does n't do a good job . I am not sure why it works for some people and not others but now I have a barely used shaver in my bathroom.I was very disappointed with the results or lack there of .
 Sent the entirely wrong product , could not send correct product so now I have wasted over two weeks for a refund .
 I purchased a Braun Activator 8585 about 1 month ago . I am trying to understand the logic behind the cleaning system -LRB- other than having to pay a monthly maintenance fee -RRB- . The box mentioned something about a computer chip . I believe that the programmer must have been sleeping when he programmed the chip in my charger.I have the following problem with the cleaner.I have a full beard . This means I only shave the neck -LRB- about 1 min per shave -RRB- . My hair is blond and thin . I always take the foil off and clean after each shave . In other words there should be no strain on the shaver and the area that I shave is probably 1/5 of a typically shave . On Thursday after a shave the unit went thru an `` Intensive '' cleaning cycle . I shaved again on Friday . On Friday night the unit showed `` ECO '' . I did not shave on Saturday and the unit showed `` Normal '' . I woke up on Sunday and the unit showed `` Intensive '' . Just to recap , I shaved my neck ones after an `` Intensive '' cleaning cycle and the unit went from `` ECO '' to `` Normal '' to `` Intensive '' all by itself . Braun should let the user select the cleaning cycle.I have the feeling that the shaver was invented and programmed to make Braun more money in-between shaver purchases . How can one justify $ 10 for 10 oz of cleaning solution when the production cost is probably pennies per oz ? How can you make a customer believe that the shaver needs an intensive cleaning after 1 min off shaving ? Where is the logic -LRB- lack of logic -RRB- ? BTW I do not see any difference in shaving between my $ 60 . - Braun 5520 and this new shaver.Bottom Line : I have always liked Braun Shavers -LRB- I owned about 5 so far -RRB- . I give the shaver 4 stars -LRB- still some stray hair that it does n't shave -RRB- ; the cleaning unit 2 stars -LRB- lack of logic -RRB- then deduct 1 star for the price of the shaver and deduct one star for the price of the cleaning solution.I would suggest buying a Braun XP Flex for $ 50 with a yearly cost -LRB- cutter head every 18-24 month -RRB- of about $ 15 vs the 8585 for $ 140 and a yearly cost -LRB- cutter head plus solutions -RRB- of about $ 80 .
 I have been happily using Braun shavers for over 20 years . My model 6520 Ultra Speed is stiil going strong . I mention this for a couple of reasons
 I found the shaver to be overated . After years of using a Norelco triple header , I thought of trying a Braun and found it to be difficult to achieve a good shave . The Norelco was far superior . I returned it to Braun , Amazon would not take it back because of the head cleaning fluid . Which is another expense , the cleaning fluid only lasts for about a month and needs to be replaced , even if not used , it evaporates . I would not recomend .
 Have owned a Braun Activator razor for less than 1 year , and have gone through 3 foils that have torn during normal use . You simply can not replace just the foil , but you have to buy the entire shaving block along with the foil which gets expensive . During use , this razor did not give a close shave as advertised . I spent twice as much time shaving with the Braun than I did with my old Norelco just to get a half way decent shave . Nicks and cuts were commonplace which I found amazing with an electric shaver ! I wish I would have never purchased this product.Lesson learned , I am running back to Norelco .
 When I first bought this product , I liked the shave . Now five months later , it has degraded significantly . The blades are supposed to be replaced every 18 months , not every five . Turning the blades around helped some.Also , I do n't like the fact that the cleaning fluid smells like artifical lemons .
 I guess I was hoping for that `` magic pill '' that would get me jump-started on my weight loss . This product was n't it . No noticeable weight loss , minimal boost of metabolism and energy . I 'm on my second bottle and despite taking the product as directed , I 'm not sure I 'll reorder . It just does n't seem worth it .
 Do not order this product . I ordered this kit and it came two days ago . The kit had nothing in it !!!! It was just the blue container . Granted , the container is of good quality , but it was supposed to contain the homeopathic pellets . So , I requested a replacement . The package came in a timely manner . I , literally , JUST opened the replacement package . There is nothing in it !!! Just skip this product all together . The shipper obviously has a QC problem .
 Homeopathy is a scam of the worst kind . It is implausible . It does not do anything , and it is ridiculous . Please save yourself from wasting money that you could use on actual things that you might need . Do not feed the scam .
 This is one hundred twenty-three dollars worth of placebo . Anyone considering using this or any other homeopathic remedy really needs to become aware of the fanciful principles behind homeopathy - it 's not some sort of natural , herb-based treatment ; it 's pure wish-thinking . Homeopaths believe that a substance which produces disease symptoms in a healthy person can be used to cure a person already suffering from the same symptoms . If that 's not childish enough , homeopaths also believe that in order for this magic to work , the `` active ingredient '' must be diluted repeatedly until not a single molecule of the substance remains in the dilution medium -LRB- water . -RRB- Read that again - there are NO ingredients in homeopathic remedies apart from water , sometimes sugar , and whatever binding agent is used to turn this `` concentrated nothing '' into pill form . This is why homeopathic doctors -LRB- read : QUACKS -RRB- can state truthfully that there are no side effects to homeopathic medicines - there are no effects whatsoever , beyond a possible placebo effect . For years skeptics like James Randi have downed whole bottles of homeopathic sleeping pills while delivering lectures on the idiocy of homeopathy , with nary an ill effect , and without getting at all drowsy . Unfortunately , due to the general ignorance about this baloney , drug companies have even put homeopathic labels on actual medicines -LRB- Zicam , for one -RRB- just as a marketing gimmick , even though -LRB- by homeopathic standards -RRB- the medicines contain a huge overdose . Quackwatch.com has a good section devoted to this nonsense - I recommend anyone considering throwing their money away on these products -LRB- AND , by rejecting real medicine , jeopardizing their health -RRB- check the site .
 This product is a waste of money and potentially dangerous . People have suffered serious harm and even death through relying on homeopathy instead of medicine . Homeopathy is often confused with natural or herbal medicine , but that is a false perception -LRB- seeTrick or Treatment ?
 This part is listed as 30B for the Braun shaver but it is not 30B . The part I received was for a smaller model of shaver . It does not fit the Braun series 340 . As for Goodman 's , they did a good job . They refunded my money when I returned the part I received . Note the listing on Amazon does say 30B but that was not what I received .
 sent wrong product when i returned the item it cost me shipping and they credited my account without paying for my shipping and order mistake was thiers .
 I have 2 Braun shavers , in both the foil broke very quickly.When I saw the price of the replacement foil I decided to buy a new shaver . I found a Philips/Norelco for $ 30 . If you need a new foil , do yourself a favor and look for a new shaver of a different brand . Rotary blades seem to be more durable than vibrating ones .
 Ordered this item and was notified it would ship Nov. 12th and arrive Dec. 3rd at the latest . On Dec. 4th I wrote to tell seller it had n`t arrived and was told only then that item was unavailable . Unacceptable service from seller .
 We received the lotion , and the pump did n't work so we had to purchase another bottle with a pump . My boyfriend said that he did n't really notice a difference in his skin until he mixed the lotion with some shaving soap and incorporated that mixture into his daily shaving regimen ; which is what he was already doing with Vaseline intensive care lotion . It really was n't worth the money for him .
 I tried the Jason shaving lotion because I 've been looking for an effective , hypoallergenic shaving lotion that does n't squirt out of an aerosol can . This product smells strongly of chamomile and an incense-like smell . That may be okay for a hand soap , but I do n't want that smell on my face . Most shaving creams and even natural hand soaps lubricate better than this product . The lotion does n't rinse off as easily as most shaving creams or liquid soaps . Almost any hand soap or leave-in hair-and-skin conditioner -LRB- such asPaul Mitchell Tea Tree Hair and Body Moisturizer 10.14 Oz -RRB- would be a better alternative .
 I bought this accidentally thinking it was the aftershave which I really like . In small amounts it works a little like the aftershave , but I would n't recommend shaving with it .
 My husband LOVES the after shave , not this shaving lotion . I made the mistake of ordering three bottles . My husband gave it a try but did not like it .
 I have had this unit for two years and have had some mixed results . My first unit lasted 6 months , burned up with a pop and smoke . After returning this unit my next unit is working but I have to be careful to not run it too long . After about 4 to 5 min . it starts to heat up . I Purchased it to be a heavy duty unit at $ 220.00 sorry to say it is not .
 Pros : - Mat itself is comfortable - Relatively inexpensive -LRB- or in this case , maybe cheap IS the correct word -RRB- for a massaging back matCons : - Cord is short - the picture of the guy on the couch using it is unrealistic unless he has an extension cord under the couch - Low massage strength - Massage areas lose effect when more than one area or heat is turned on -LRB- see comment -RRB- - Strap that is designed to hold massage pad to chairs is ineffective - Not easy to roll up for storageI purchased this as an impulse buy -LRB- for myself -RRB- at Christmas time . I intended to use it after my daily gym workouts.Long story short , at high-power , each area gives a so-so massage . However , unless you have hours on end to spend on the pad , that is worthless , since the massage motors are all dependent on one another.What I mean is , if you have one of the zones on at full power with no heat , it works at full power . Add a 2nd section and each section operates at 1/2 power . Have all the sections going , and well let 's just say the vibrations certainly wo n't disturb anyone . Add the heat , and the whole thing might as well be turned off.Bottom Line : Find another option
 It feels decent just for the sake of the light vibrations but if you have tight muscles that honestly do need a massage this is not going to do anything for you . its just not strong enough being its just basicly a long pad with so so vibrations . the heat may help you go to sleep better maybe .
 I am returning mine , no problem with the seller but not thrilled with the prouct . It is not as pulsating on the back as I hoped , more of just vibration . I was looking for something that would work better on deep tissue rather than surface vibration .
 I purchased this mat for a birthday gift for my husband . We took it out turned it on and laid on it . Yeah , it heats up and vibrates . Yet massage is not what you get . It 's gives the same feeling you have when you get finished mowing the lawn on the riding lawn mower . Your sort of numb , but you do n't feel anymore relaxed or massaged .
 This product is not too smooth and it scratches the nails when you use it.I hated this product and never will buy it .
 Bought this because the old wrap works so well . The new one made in china is no way near the same quality.The contents feel a lot more coarse and not enough . Have to juggle it around to get the herbs in the middle so it does not cool off too fast . Would not recommend it to anyone .
 I did not notice any difference in my eyes after a month 's use . These capsules are huge ! Will not buy again .
 Used this product before it works great and the price offered here is unbeatable , however Nutricity ships these out apparently , I ordered this with Expediated or 1 nite shipping on October 2nd , Now October 12th and amazon emails me saying it has n't been shipped yet due to the provider and reasons are unknown . So it 's a little false advertisement , but these are great to use , quick mass , better pumps , especially when you stack these with no2 it enhances the effects of both . But just thought I 'd give everyone a heads up , if you 're ordering , do n't expect to receive it for weeks .
 My 18 month old son destroyed this toothbrush in one week . The head / bristles are falling apart . We have already thrown out one of the two brushes and the second one will be gone in another week . Very poor quality product .
 These are n't bad for blocking noise , however when the cord moves , or rubs against anything , it makes a loud scraping noise that is channeled directly into the ear . This sound is louder that what I am usually trying to block out .
 These are very POOR ... and do not block much sound at all . I got them for riding on a motorcycle to shield out some wind noise . These do n't work ... the foam ones work better-much better . I waisted $ 8 bucks ... I do n't know where others are plugging them into , but if its in there ears , these ar n't working ... save your money .
 ... I would . Although they are inexpensive , if it was n't such a problem , I 'd ask for my money back.What a piece of garbage . I purchased these for a Formula 1 race . There is no protection with these . Do not waste money . Look for something else , as we had to no ear protection with these and ended up with our fingers in our ears .
 This heating pad is supposed to provide moisture by your back sweating . Kind of a silly premise which I was n't aware of when I bought it , and it does n't work anyway . The heating pad gets so hot so quickly that you ca n't leave it on long enough to sweat . The result is no moist heat ... just heat . As a safety feature you have to hold the control on at all times . OK I guess , but it 's a pain . The pad is large enough to cover your whole back which is nice .
 This item was given as a gift and I have been told that it does not take much if any moisture from the air and does not live up to its moist heat advertising .
 One of the drawbacks was that it is to large to be used in the seated position.Instructions state not to bend the product so it can only be used while laying down.Also the manual switch is very inconvienient.After releasing the switch the heat goes away fast and you must then repeat the holding of the manual switch . Not worth it for the cost and time involved .
 We have used for several several years , and now the switch is broken . We have been happy with product , but when I called the company to get new switch , was told that they will not send replacement parts . Switch is simple to replace . 4 screws , clip off old clip on new , 4 screws back on cover . They are happy to have you send it in for repair , for $ 30 , plus shipping , plus all the time you do not have the thermophore . by the time I would ship and have it repaired , it would be too close to new price . Bummer ! so easy , yet company will not simply sell switch . So beware , it will work well for time , but if you need repair , you might as well throw away and get new one , perhaps different brand .
 when i bought this i selected 220 volt but they brought 120 volt . . i sent them product error but the medical department store did not answer , , then i claimed to amazon and they closed my claim file because the store placed arefund but uptill now i did not receive any thing ... donot bye from medical department store .
 Very confusing.I ordered the automatic switch and received what is apparently a manual switch . You have to hold the switch down or it turns off.The box clearly states Automatic switch yet the manual clearly states that it is a manual momentary switch.I also bought mine through who Amazon lists as DAB which turned out to be Potential Dynamix LLC.Also what I received was an open box , which was quite worn looking , was literally open and there no shrink wrap or tape . The end of the box was crushed yet Amazon had shipped it an oversized box so they had to have tossed this obviously worn , not sealed box as the lid was 1/2 way open.I was told by customer service that if I wanted a brand new unit I should buy it from Amazon.com not from a 3rd party with fulfillment by Amazon.com very confusing to me , I assumed that fullfillment by Amazon.com meant I would receive a new product in a factory sealed box . Apparently not the case . Also as this is a personal use item I would think it would be illegal to sell such used!I have not experience with how this heating pad works as I am not going to handle it unless I have a new one .
 I am so disappointed in this product . It sells itself as automatic , but it is NOT . You have to manually hold down the button to get it to produce heat . Who wants to have to hold down a button to get it to work ? There were versions sold as manual that described this . I purposely looked for one that was automatic to avoid having to hold down a button non-stop to get it to work . This product was sold as an automatic version -LRB- even the box says automatic -RRB- . Having to hold down a button non-stop to get it to work does n't qualify as automatic in my opinon . I feel like I have been misled . I am very disappointed . I can only imagine use of this item on a regular basis would be very uncomfortable , defeating the point of trying to releave tension . Do not purchase this if you are truly looking for a hands-free item -LRB- beyond initially turning it on -RRB- .
 After all the reading I did of all the reviews and comments , I was SURE I made the right decision for this heating pad.However , no one mentioned that there were ONLY TWO settings for it
 I returned this heating pad because it 's not what I was looking for . It does n't get really hot and you have to hold the switch down to keep the heat on . As soon as you let the switch go , the pad turns off .
 Simply , this heating pad works great in every way except one
 I returned this heating pad because I was very unhappy with its performance . However , I would like to say upfront that MedexSupply was a pleasure to deal with - they were efficient and very helpful in dealing with my concerrns . First of all , this is not a muff - it is a flat heating pad with velcro straps that can be used to wrap the pad around hands -LRB- or whatever -RRB- . I see that it is now described on Amazon as a pad , but I believe it was described as a muff when I made the purchase . Although I was surprised it was not a hand muff per se , that was a fairly minor matter to me . The reason I returned this heating pad is that there is no temperature setting on the control - the options are On , Pause and Off ! The pad gets very hot quickly - the accompanying booklet says it will do this , so that was not unexpected . Once it is hot enough -LRB- and it rapidly gets quite hot -RRB- , you have to take your hand out of the muff you 've made with the pad and push the pause button on the control . Then , once it has cooled down too much , you have to again take a hand out to push the button to restart the heating cycle . The constant need to manually adjust the temperature made the experience frantic rather than soothing . MedexSupply did refund the purchase price of $ 45.87 , but they did not cover the $ 8.75 I had paid for shipping -LRB- again , a minor issue , but ... -RRB- .
 I bought my thermophore eight months ago . I always took care of it , and thought of it as a valuable investment -- in terms of money , but also because it is very useful in my medical care.It worked very well ... at first . Then it started to warm less and less . Till one day , it warmed no more.I did not worry . The manual stated that the manufacturer stood behind their products and that they had a shop in US soil full of workers willing to fix their products for free if under warranty , or repair them for $ 30 if past warranty.My thermophore was well within its warranty period . I sent it well packed with a copy of my original receipt.I was then , in shock , when I received a form letter that informed that my warranty did not apply because my thermophore had been manufactured over three years ago . Yet at least as far as a consumer can tell , the date of manufacture is not written anywhere in the original box , its manual , or the device itself . And , if the device spent over three years in an Amazon warehouse , is that reason to declare a product ineligible for warranty coverage?Why was this requirement never documented anywhere in the manual , in the warranty text , or the website of the manufacturer ? And what about that $ 30 offer to fix the thermophore ? I was instead , offered to be charged $ 40 instead.Needless to say a disappointment ! This company and its product might have at some point manufactured excellent products , but seems that the pernicious temptation to destroy customer loyalty by saving a few bucks has seeped in ... This is a manufacturer in decline . Look elsewhere for a good heating pad .
 The image of the product leads you to believe that this is the original thermophore brand heating pack in the red box . It even says `` red box '' at the end of the description . however when the product arrived in the mail , it was in a white box and said it is made by a company called battlecreek . This product is not anywhere near the quality of the original thermophore heating packs . The product was extremely misrepresented . The only positive thing i have to say is that i returned the product and was given a full refund without any problems .
 This product does not work as it is suppose to do nothing was done about it!Thermophore Back/Arthritis Heating Pad , Large , Standard 14 '' x 27 '' -LRB- Auto-Switch -RRB- I 've a petite one .
 I ordered this on August 22nd and still have n't received it !! They did n't call when they said they would . Instead they emailed me they should 've called . Still no delivery . I had gotten this brand name which worked great from my chiropractor over 25 years ago . It just broke 2 weeks ago so I looked up the brand and ordered another . I had no idea the company was so ass backwards in their shipping dept !
 I 've owned several pairs of the original green Spenco insoles -LRB- Running/Walking -RRB- , and have loved them . I run several times per week to train for my job and they have improved the cushioning of the already comfortable Asics Gel-Nimbus 11 's . However , these new gel models are terrible for running . They offer barely more cushioning than the stock insoles on a normal basis such as standing or walking , but when you begin running they just squish into nothing . Even for standing around I still would buy the green ones .
 I received the new Jason Tea Tree and Cinnamon toothpaste instead . Product name and image are misleading and should be removed .
 The inside has a foam wrapper around the cheep rubbery material and it is not made very well . For a cheep fix it is not bad but it is not woth the price .
 Good toothbrush but the batteries are not replaceable so you need to replace the whole unit when they wo n't hold a charge anymore
 Well , for me it 's a bad experience with this item . In my case , it woks fine only 3 months , after that this have an erratic perfomance . At this mommnet i take a decisition
 I returned this product with Delievery confirmation showing the seller received it back on Dec 23rd 2010 but still they have not posted a credit for the return . I sent them an email yesterday to check the status but still have not received a reply from them .
 I purchased 3 of these toothbrushes for my family in June 2006 . The toothbrush does a very thorough cleaning and leaves your mouth with a ` fresh-from-the-dentist ' feel . Also the two minute timer is very useful for children as a way to encourage longer brushing . Dentist commented at 6 month check up that our teeth all looked well cared for ! BUT one toothbrush simply stopped working in Jan 2007 - this was certainly annoying for a product only in use for 7 months but it was still under guarantee so I packaged it off to a service centre per Braun 1-800 number instructions . Never heard anything for weeks and finally called the service centre . They had been unable to repair - -LRB- thanks for the follow up call , not ! -RRB- - and had advised Braun . Called Braun and they said they would send out a replacement shortly . Well , this became the longest journey from NJ warehouse to my DC address ever ! Took 3 months and 5 phone calls on my part . On one occasion , I explained to customer service people that I was still waiting for the toothbrush . I had followed the Federal Express tracking number but Federal Express had been unable to deliver as the address was incomplete . They had returned the toothbrush to Braun . The Braun customer service agent asked me curtly `` why do you blame Braun for that ? '' Not once in any of the 5 phone calls to Braun did anyone offer an apology for the situation and the ridiculously long amount of time I was without a toothbrush . Customer service - zero stars . toothbrush - 4 stars . I went down the middle and awarded it 2 stars / .
 Amazon recommended I buy these Oral B Sonic replacement brush heads for my Oral B Pulsonic toothbrush - but they do n't fit . The Sonic is very different to the Pulsonic and brush heads can not be interchanged.Oral B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush
 Three heads in the package , that 's great but it does not fit the Vitality . So i guess since i opened the pkg , will have to throw out . Better to buy at CVS or Walgreens and get the right heads or return with no questions asked even with open package .
 This is a good brushing system , but only if you keep the costs to a minimum . At $ 5 per brush , the $ 14 + shipping for this is a TOTAL RIPOFF . Do not overpay for these brushes , they are not worth it .
 i bought this set of replacements on amazon and so far 2 of the 3 heads are useless after only 2-3 weeks use . for some reason , after i used the first head for a couple weeks , the head would n't spin anymore ; it would just vibrate . i thought it was just one of the very few defective ones that i was unlucky to get so i threw it away . i opened a second one and the same thing happened after just about the same amount of time -LRB- 2 weeks -RRB- . the brush heads look like new still but it 's very loose and all it does is vibrate , it does n't spin . beware - do not buy these on amazon , buy them at your local walmart or target instead .
 I rate this poorly because it does not fit my toothbrush . I thought `` oral-B '' meant it would fit my brush , and that `` sonic '' referred to the type of head . I did not see anything that said `` this brush head only fits the sonic style oral-b '' and because all the models I have ever had and the models my friends and family have take the same brush heads . Whenever I buy Oral B heads in a store they fit my toothbrush . Therefore , I will describe this site and/or this brush `` not user friendly '' . If not all your heads fit all the models , you should make it clear . This was a big waste of time and money for me so other consumers be forewarned . I saw the high rating on this product and that made me trust the purchase . I am pleased to lower the star ratings on this to warn other customers . From now on I will buy tooth brush heads in a store even though that is less convenient for me .
 I have cancelled this subscription . Amazon 's note to me `` You canceled this subscription on September 17 , 2010 '' . I have signed up for 2 units of 3 brushes every 6 months . My account note reads
 I am very pleased with this product . It was sent very fast and in great condition .
 These did not fit my oral B vitality toothbrush . I emailed the manufacturer and they insisted they did -LRB- and they do n't ! -RRB- . Now i have three toothbrush heads that do n't fit and am out my money . Frustrated and upset . Would never order from this company again .
 I was excited to find these on subscribe and save and the price was very reasonable in comparison to retail . The brush itself is a different size and shape than the smaller round heads I presently use , so that was another reason I was looking forward to using these . The cut out shape in the stem of the brush attachment is entirely different than that of the brush I have on there now , and so it does not snap onto the brush handle at all . I do n't know if Oral B/Braun has changed the brush design since other reviewers ' comments , so just beware that this refill will likely NOT fit your vitality sonic . Bummed : -LRB-
 Got a brush head with bent heads . That may be the reason why the product is cheaper here than other stores .
 Product posted in good time but the ultimate nightmare -- did n't fit the rechargeable unit I have which says Vitality Sonic
 Do n't be confused by it 's serving size trick . This product offers half the DHA as other ginkgo + DHA supplements available on Amazon . Funny , since compared to the others , it leaves more of a fishy aftertaste . Not recommended .
 The stockings were very nice but there was no way to keep them up , and they were too short . I looked EVERYWHERE for garter belt ot girdle , so if you do n't have one already you will need to order one on-line -LRB- good luck -RRB- , or choose stockings with the elastic band to keep them up .
 It was too expensive and a waste of my hard earned money . I wish it would have had bigger holes for the ta ta 's . And it 's not comfortable the way my chest and stomach rests on it . I will never use it . But that is just me . I had a nice pillow for the ta ta 's years ago but my puppy chewed it up . Darn it ! It had big holes and did n't fit but under the chest . So comfortable . But i ca n't find it out there anywhere.It looks to be well made and would last years and years if this is what you are looking for .
 The product does n't fit exactly as it should . It is either slightly too small or the sucking power of the A/C is bending the product so that there are gaps between the edge of it and the A/C vent . The filtering material seems good , but it just does n't fit snug .
 The filter we ordered was quite a bit larger than the size it is marked as and did n't fit . We did get it installed but it had to be manipulated and bent into place with a mallet . The location requires an 8ft ladder to install it in the ceiling , so we we 're not happy customers . We could n't find this size anywhere , so we were happy to find it through Amazon . But disappointed in the sizing which should be standard .
 These are decent filters for the money . Unfortunately -LRB- for me -RRB- they decided to make the 12x25x1 filter 11x24x1 which proved to be too small for my unit . I tried shifting it every way possible but the only position it seems to fully cover and not allow dust and debris into the coils is shoved way down . Problem is the filter then gets soaking wet from the condensation channel that runs below it . Shame this company did n't decide to go ahead and make the filter the TRUE size stated on the package . I have no use for these now . Yes , I am blaming the maker for something I knew when I ordered them , but when I really think about it , it is the actual size that should be listed on the package . Not a fictional size .
 I 've purchased other products from Interactive Health , including the iJoy -LRB- which is AMAZING compared to other massage chairs I 've tried -RRB- , and their Ottoman 2.0 -LRB- which hits the spot on the calves wonderfully -RRB- . I bought this in hopes to get the same quality and effect as I have from their other products , but have been disappointed . The two massaging handles on either side of the pillow massage the sides of my neck well , but does n't hit the back of my neck at all -- and that 's where my sore spot always tends to be at ! The `` pillow '' itself is hard and can be uncomfortable , so you have to position your head carefully in order to really relax.I would n't recommend purchasing this massager at its expensive price . However , should you find this massager on sale , it 's a decent product . I 'm still in the pursuit of a more effective neck massager , though ...
 Do n't bother if you need support for your knee . Falls down after a few steps and offers NO support . Save your money .
 As I said in my title line , this is a well made product . But that 's were it ends for me . First I ordered a 3x size and it was way too large , I returned it and ordered a 2x . The 2x fit tighter -LRB- at least would stay put on my knee -RRB- , but give it a few minutes an it slid down to my ankle . So now I have a second item to return . Frustrating , believe me ! So in conclusion , the measurement instructions are terrible.All I can say is that after years of purchases from Amazon and never returning anything . It is best -LRB- for me at least -RRB- to not order anything that requires a size ! Now I am forced to drive all over the countryside for at least an hour trying to find a proper fitting support.Amazon has a very easy return policy ! Just keep all packing , it will smooth things greatly . I was impressed !
 I used to love Vitamin Shoppe Ultimate 10 probiotics -- they worked and were much less expensive than most other brands . But more and more , I started getting batches of them that were speckled and old-looking and did n't work . Most consumers probably ca n't tell whether their probiotics work or not , since it 's the kind of thing that you do n't really notice . But I can tell because I had a severe candida problem for years due to undiagnosed thyroid and adrenal problems , and this product made a huge difference in helping to get it under control . When I felt the candida coming back slightly , I 'd take about 10 of these and break one apart to use topically -- which is what really worked great and immediately -- and voila , next day , no symptoms . But when I started getting the speckled batches of probiotics , they stopped working . At first Vitamin Shoppe took them back with an apology -- but now , so many batches are like this that VS 's corporate office has told employees they 're fine , it 's just a `` new formula . '' It may be a new formula , but if so , it does n't work . I wanted to get one tested , but that costs $ 1,000 + , so instead I just stopped buying them . They are crap -- do n't waste your money !
 I bought one for my son three years ago . It stopped working just after I used several times -LRB- within half a year -RRB- . Last week , I bought another one for my new born girl . I tested it . It was not working well . Sometimes it never beeps so that I do n't know if it has completed . The thermometer should record previous reading , but this function never works . I had to return this thermometer .
 This lasted a few days , but the bottom `` support '' piece came off its hinge after that . Until then , it was okay . The bottom support was also small , which meant heavy drinks seemed like they might break it.I did like the folding concept ; it meant it was out of my way when I was n't using it .
 Since when is taking something out of an injectionmold , `` handmade '' ? The whole thing is light weight , hollow plastic . Ca n't weight more than an ounce.Not going to last more than a few months.I would not have paid $ 5.00 muchless $ 20 if I had seen it in person first.This is my first bad internet experience.Do not buy one of these .
 We have purchased 3 inflatable snug-tubs from Kelgar . The infant size tub was fine , and still works okay after 2 years . However , the slightly larger toddler size tub has a slow leak . The first one we bought had a very slow leak ; after 9 months it turned into a fast leak , so we bought another one , thinking we would n't be unlucky enough to get another defective one twice in a row.Wrong !! The second one arrived with a slow leak in the same place as the previous toddler size tub . At first it was so slow , it just meant we 'd have to reinflate it once in a while ; then you have to reinflate it more and more often until finally it wo n't last through one bathing without going limp . After the second flop , I decided to just send the leaky tub back to Kel-Gar and ask for a free replacement . They never responded to my friendly letter . When I finally called -LRB- took me a while to get around to it ; I kept thinking that surely a replacement would be arriving any week now ! -RRB- , they were totally unhelpful.The woman who answered at `` Customer Service '' kept interrupting me to tell me that they do not accept returns , and any problems have to be taken up with the retailer . Way to stand behind your products , dudes!Then when I called the retalier -LRB- Right Start -RRB- just now , they said that it 's not their responsibility to handle a replacement , it 's the manufacturer 's -- BUT at least this customer service person was polite and said she 's ask her boss and look into it more , just to see if there is anything they can do.I 'm really surprised that Kel-Gar cares so little about their image with the public and about providing pleasant and helpful service to their customers , especially repeat customers such as myself . I mean , come on , how hard is it to throw a piece of plastic that weights about 8 ounces in the mail to keep a customer happy ?? However , since that is their attitude , you 're better off buying an inflatable tub from a real-life -LRB- non-virtual -RRB- retailer with a decent 90-day return policy , such as Babies-R-Us or Target , so that if a leak develops you can physically take it back and get a replacement . That 's what we 'll be doing from here on out.So long , Kel-Gar . The tub was `` just ducky '' but your service was DOA!Update
 PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT buy this product !!!!!!!!!!!!! The tub is made of PVC vinyl which is also known as the `` poison plastic '' . PVC is NOT a safe material . Please read up on PVC and it 's effects on the human body if you are n't sure about it . I think you will be blown away by what you read . I contacted the company and they said that this tub meets government regulations . Unbelievable that the government does n't insist that companies use safer materials for the children and the environment .
 We bought this tub 3 months ago for our 6 month old daughter . It was great until it developed a slow leak on a seam . We would just have to re-inflate it a bit before each use , but now it wo n't even make it through one bath . Since it had only been 3 months , I called Amazon to see if they would replace it . Amazon told me I needed to contact the manufacturer , Kelgard . When I contacted them I was told to contact Amazon . So bottom line is no one seems to want to send us a replacement . It is great until it leaks . Is sure seems like we should have gotten more than 3 months use from it !
 This tub does the job well . I do agree with how the baby slides around the bottom , but I have solved that by folding a towel and putting it at the bottom . Although you end up with a sopping wet towel , this way , it 's much easier to bathe your baby without him/her sliding all over the place . Plus you dont have to worry about bumped heads or anything . Other baths on the market look great , but I worry about my baby and the hard plastic . The cuddle tub looks great , I havent tried that one out . I figure soaking a wash cloth in warm water and putting it over the baby would be a good idea for the cuddle tub so he/she doesnt get cold being suspended over the bath like that . Also , I sister in law has the safer bather . It works very well too , but it does start to stink after a while and if the water is high , it floats away from you a lot ... lol !! All I can say is shop around . Check other stores , too . Target has some great baths not advertised here . Good Luck ! This is a special area that needs a lot of attention for safety and comfort . Good luck and congratulations to everyone with your babies .
 I have looked at alot of other reviews before I bought and wished that I had n't because . You ca n't go off someone else 's experience , you REALLY have to experience it for yourself . First of all it 's too bulky . The suction thing on the tub did n't stick and it was in the way when I tried to shower and kept falling down . My poor baby kept sliding because there is no non-skid at the bottom of the tub , so I had to go out and buy a small mat to put at the bottom.I bought this tub only because my baby was out growing the fold away bath chair but it looks as though I will have to continue using it and buy a larger one for her . I was very temped to send it back but I 'm just going to sell it on ebay.I 'm sorry but it was a waste of money for me . I 'm happy that it did aleast work out for the other moms , maybe mines is defected !
 This bath tub is a great idea , but it 's made of vinyl , which makes it unsafe for babies & children . Vinyl leaches chemicals into the air which are very dangerous to humans , esp . babies & children . Ever smell that `` new shower curtain '' smell -LRB- you know the one -RRB- its a result of chemical off-gassing , releasing phthalates in your home . Phthalates cause endocrine disruption , are linked to asthma , and have developmental and reproductive effects.If you are buying this thinking it offers a safer bath environment for your child , think again !

 I like the idea behind this tub -- the size , the inflatable sides and bottom to cushion baby , the suction cup to attach it to the adult tub and the generous drain are all good features . However , the bottom is so slippery that after one try , I was afraid to use it again ! Even though I never take my eyes , nor hands for that matter , off of my son while in the tub , he still slipped all over in this one . You are supposed to be able to lay them back to wash their hair , but he just slipped right down into the bottom of the tub . Unless you find a way to make it slip-proof , even for babies that sit up well , I would not recommend this product!Our Snug Tub seems to have a slow leak which is also annoying .
 The purchase of this product was very smooth and I was so excited to get this tub ! Our daughter had outgrown her infant tub and needed something a little bigger to sit and splash around in . This was great , for a while . It 's slightly bigger than some other inflatable tubs , so if you have a small tub be prepared for a squeeze . I also liked that you could keep it inflated and hang it to dry using the suction cup attachment . Unfortunately , it only lasted a few months before a very small tear appeared on the side seem . I would expect that to happen eventually after extended use , but we only had it a short time and only deflated and blew it back up 2-3 times within that time span -LRB- for traveling -RRB- . May be we just got a defective tub , but I did n't want to take the chance of wasting money on another tub only for the same thing to happen again , so I ordered a different one . Bummer .
 The drain in the bottom of the tub was n't made correctly and the tub leaked air the first time we used it.We ended up purchasing a different tub at a baby store , and had much better luck . I 'd pass on this tub .
 For starters this tub is rather wide on the narrowest end and I was unable to get it under our faucet in the bathtub to fill it with water . This seems a little ridiculous since I 'd rather not fill it using a cup . Our bathtubs is a regular size -LRB- at least I thought -RRB- . My child also seemed to slide a lot when I would lean her back to wash her hair , she would slide down into the tub.We decided to send this one back . The biggest drawback was the fact that I could not fill this tub easily .
 In using this product for approx . a year , I have to had to use vinyl sealer for a couple of leaks around the seams . The concept is incredible and has saved my daughter 's head a couple of times . The non-slip bottom is excellent ! She loves playing in it as well . If it were made with better vinyl I would give it a 10 star ! Seriously , if you do n't want to make repairs , pass on this product otherwise it is money down the drain in approx . 1 month .
 I was hoping this would be a good transition tub for my 6 month old who is growing out of the tub that fits in the sink.If you are in the same situation , I caution you with this purchase -1 -RRB- It reeks like plastic and has for weeks .2 -RRB- it is dangerously slippery . My son can sit up very securely , however he immediately slid . I even bought a tub mat insert to try , and he still slipped .3 -RRB- It barely fits into our tub .
 The product does n't fit exactly as it should . It is either slightly too small or the sucking power of the A/C is bending the product so that there are gaps between the edge of it and the A/C vent . The filtering material seems good , but it just does n't fit snug .
 The filter we ordered was quite a bit larger than the size it is marked as and did n't fit . We did get it installed but it had to be manipulated and bent into place with a mallet . The location requires an 8ft ladder to install it in the ceiling , so we we 're not happy customers . We could n't find this size anywhere , so we were happy to find it through Amazon . But disappointed in the sizing which should be standard .
 These are decent filters for the money . Unfortunately -LRB- for me -RRB- they decided to make the 12x25x1 filter 11x24x1 which proved to be too small for my unit . I tried shifting it every way possible but the only position it seems to fully cover and not allow dust and debris into the coils is shoved way down . Problem is the filter then gets soaking wet from the condensation channel that runs below it . Shame this company did n't decide to go ahead and make the filter the TRUE size stated on the package . I have no use for these now . Yes , I am blaming the maker for something I knew when I ordered them , but when I really think about it , it is the actual size that should be listed on the package . Not a fictional size .
 Compared to other dry wash cloths , these were both small , expensive and not as good . When you can get 500 pcs for just above 20 usd why buy these ?
 I really wish Amazon would list ingredients in their vitamins so we know what we 're getting . In this instance , I was upset to see that taking the THREE vitamins a day you need with this bottle only amounts to 8 % of your daily needed value of calcium -LRB- 75mg -RRB- !! You get more calcium drinking a glass of MILK and that would be much , much cheaper . Do yourself a favor and do n't throw away money on this product . You can buy a whole-food calcium vitamin on Amazon called Rainbow Light , which has 50 % of your daily needed calcium -LRB- 500mg -RRB- and higher amounts of all other minerals/ingredients -LRB- e.g. magnesium -RRB- for a lot less money . I 'm going to try that next !
 Maybe I 'm not taking it correctly , but I 've tried this formula on an empty stomach as recommended for the past couple of weeks ; one capsule per day . I have not noticed any change to me cognitive functioning or energy level .
 this product did nothing for me . what a hoax !! would n't recomend it , no way . very sorry I bought it in the first place .
 I 'm wondering if the dosage on this capsule is REALLY correct . The capsule does zip -- you get a vague energy buzz , but nothing sensational or really `` rhodiola '' feeling . This is more like caffeine . I am sure that either the processing of this herb is off base , or they have included some other ingredient that flavors the way it feels when you take it . Not at all like the quality Rhodiola from Siberia .
 This product must have very low percentages of active ingredients . I do n't get much effect from it , despite the fact that it is two or three times `` stronger '' by MG dose than the Swedish product I normally take . I 'm very surprised . Was expecting a huge boost of Rhodiola -- not much happened .
 I have been buying this brand of sugar-free DGL for a long time . I am extremely disappointed that they have recently changed the formula so that these tablets are now sickening sweet and leave an aftertaste similar to that of regular table sugar . To be clear , the principal ingredient , deglycyrrhizinated licorice , is the same . But they have added sorbitol , anise seed powder , and stearic acid to `` other ingredients . '' It is sorbitol , a sugar alcohol , that adds the hypersweet taste . I 'm looking for another brand and am returning this order .
 DO NOT BUY THIS !!! - They changed the product . It is no longer licorice . It is only anise powder with an artificial sweetener now .
 After applying these strips just ONCE ... I have very splotchy inconsistent white sports that looks horrible . Those splotchy marks are VERY white while the rest was hardly changed . Have a dentist whiten your teeth to do it right . My teeth look really wierd now ...
 I have tried Crest White Strips in the past and was pleased with the results , but I decided to give these Oral B a try
 Last year , I used Crest Whitestrips , and this year I decided to try a different whitening solution . I regret that decision.ABOUT MY TEETH : I drink a lot of tea and a bit of coffee , but my teeth were more dulled than yellow prior to using this product.GOOD STUFF ABOUT REMBRANDT WHITENING STRIPS : - They 're fast and easy to apply ... no goopy mess ! - They stay on well ... no slippage . - I did n't experience * any * gum/teeth sensitivity.BAD STUFF : - It 's like having pieces of waxy styrofoam in your mouth . Uncomfortable ! Definitely ca n't talk on the phone . - Results were strikingly mediocre . My teeth are possibly a tiny bit whiter , but not noticeably so.Compared with the Crest Whitestrips , I suppose the lesson is
 ... I did n't have to tell you that though . They do n't work at all , maybe one shade of whitening if you are lucky . I use whitestrips frequently to maintain white teeth . I decided to try this , no results . I am using whitestrips premium as I type this to make up for the no whitening . Oh well , they have a satisfaction guarentee , just keep -LSB- the invoice !
 Any person that give good review about this product must be working for the company a $ 20.00 plus tax this product is completly useless it breaks when you try to remove it from is glue place its rolls up making it impossible to used any any other stripos is a lot better than this garbage I 'm offended to give it one star it should ZERO STAR.Once again do n't waste your money on REMBRANDT STRIPS it DISSOLVE IN YOUR HANDS .
 What a rip off , there is barely anything in these tiny vitamins ! save your money , I ca n't believe I spent 20 $ for nothing . These great reviews are obviously fake .
 I purchased this product for my dad who has been diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa -LRB- RP -RRB- . He has very limited vision but noticed that his night vision had gotten gradually worse so I did some research and came across this product . It seemed like a really good product that provided a natural alternative to offer some relief for my dad 's failing eyesight . He took the recommended dosage daily for the last month and did not notice any improvement in his night vision . I 'm not sure if his condition hampered the effectiveness of this product but for what it states , I have to rate it a failure .
 The pills taste very bad when crushed and I have not been able to find the contents of each supplement anywhre . I dont know how much of anything I am taking . Also the information on the bottle is microscopic and very very hard to read . Since it is still hard to read I am guessing the pills are not working .
 The zombie flavor is just gross . The chap stuck its selfs is smooth and nice but I could n't get over the smell of this flavor .
 It does n't taste or smell like Grand Marnier I was very disappointed . I would rather have my chapstick in cherry flavor . Atleast It has a taste .
 Do not waste your money on this it does work even if u r doin work out n eatin right ... n also make u feel bad ...
 These covers are OK , but they 're a pretty snug fig for my toothbrush . That means I have to shove the brush in , and I worry about that . I wish they still made the covers that had a hinged top . They fit much better.However , this is better than having the toothbrush exposed to my cat , who likes to sniff it and rub up against it . Ugh !
 I absolutely ca n't stand swallowing any sort of pill -- or at least anything larger than a Pepcid , unless it has a smooth coating , such as Advil . So you might understand that I was thrilled when I first popped one of these in my mouth and thought , `` Wow ! This tastes just like Starbursts ! '' That only lasted for about three seconds , at which point the chewy globule lost any semblance of flavor except for one reminiscent of a gag-inducing chalkiness and became so sticky , I thought it was going to pull my teeth out . So my search for a candy-like calcium supplement continues . In the meantime , I 'll stick to drinking milk and reward myself with Starbursts .
 I bought a couple of these for shin splints . They 're a good idea but not very well executed . They 're difficult and awkward to get on . It 's basically an ice pack inside a stretchy sleeve as opposed to a single integrated unit . The ice pack is only sewn to the sleeve at the very top and bottom , so the rest of it is loose and likes to bunch up . Also , it never feels particularly cold , even fresh out of the freezer . It 's cold , yes , but it 's almost like it 's so insulated that you ca n't feel it very much . Does n't last very long either . I like the idea of compression + cold , and this delivers on the compression , but not so much on the cold . Better than nothing , I 'm sure , but I 'm now shopping for something better .
 The ankle opening for a size small is much too small to get over my daughters foot . If you ca n't slide it over your foot then it is useless . I was trying to replace a full lenghth one that was a wrap with a velcro closure . This one is a sock type . I loved the old one .
 These Shin Ice sleeves are a great idea , however I think buyers should be aware of a couple of things ... Definitely buy a size larger than you think you will need . These are very hard to pull on , especially when frozen . There is much too little `` ice '' in the sleeves . Not nearly enough to give shins a good icing for 15 minutes . Loses coolness rather quickly .
 As a guy who used to syran wrap frozen peas to his shin , this seemed like the perfect device . The neoprene sleeve holding an icepack to my shin was a nice step up . It worked great for about a week , then one of the ice compartments started to leak , then another , then another . After a couple of weeks , only about half the ice compartments had fluid left . Nothing was obviously poking holes in the ice pack , so I ca n't figure out where the leaks came from . My guess is that an improvement in the plastic quality/thickness for the icepack would solve the problem . Overall a great idea , if only it were more durable .
 This product is ok , however there are a few things I did n't like about it :1 . The ice pockets are so small that they warm up easily after being put in the fridge -LRB- as suggested by product pamphlet -RRB- .2 . If you do freeze it to avoid that first problem , the sleeve is very inflexible and consequently incredibly difficult to put on .3 . I felt that it was smaller than listed on the site . I 'd go a size up and if it 's too big , you can always still use it lying down or duct tape it to fit better . I ca n't really use mine !
 Make sure you measure exaclty . If you measure too small it wont fit over your foot . Then in order to fit over your foot , you get a larger size and it is too big for your leg . Not enough compression . Did n't hold ice cold long enough for me , might be long enough for you .
 Update - Amazon are wonderful , they must have contacted this seller to edit their description as now it clearly states -LRB- single roll -RRB- and the picture of the box with the numeral `` 12 '' on the front has been replaced with a picture of single rolls of tape . Thank you Amazon.I ordered this product from KV Pet because the picture shows the front of the box that states it has 12 rolls in it and the description states : Product DescriptionHighest quality of porous adhesive tape . This tape allows the skin to breathe while providing a strong adhesive protection . Waterproof . Each roll is 10 yards long . `` EACH ROLL '' implies more than one . A box arrived today with one roll loose in the box , dirty , used , unsanitary . It is medical tape for and it 's filthy . I called them and they told me I got what I ordered . I have also contacted Amazon to tell them this is a dishonest seller.I have ordered many , many things from Amazon , this is my first bad experience.I gave the order one star because I could n't submit my review without doing so .
 I ordered Quickables dry washcloths what i received was not the green bag of Quickables dry washcloths instead I received Attends dry washcloth in blue print . The package says `` new name same product '' so with that claim on the packaging i trusted it would be the same product and opened the package . However I am very disappointed that the product is totally not the same . The quality is so much cheaper and the washcloth are much thinner . It becomes so thin when i submerge it in water that its like using paper napkins . I ordered Quickables and the picture they have up is of quickables so I do not understand why they would send me a cheaper brand , this is totally misleading . I bought these for my newborn to use as baby wipes and expected the same quality as the Quckables washcloth as I have used previously . If they no longer have the Quickables washcloths then they should take their posting down and advertise the new brand . I guess this is their way of tricking customers into buying the cheaper brand . I am home taking care of my newborn and I do n't think its fair to have to drag out my newborn in the cold to the post office for a return plus I already opened the item . The reason I ordered it online so I would n't have to go out with my newborn . I contacted the seller regarding this issue and see how they wanted to resolve this and they just IGNORED me !! I wanted to give them a chance before i write a negative review and they refused to take advantage of my kindness . This is really bad customer service !!! I would never buy this product or anything from them again !!
 I bought a couple of these for shin splints . They 're a good idea but not very well executed . They 're difficult and awkward to get on . It 's basically an ice pack inside a stretchy sleeve as opposed to a single integrated unit . The ice pack is only sewn to the sleeve at the very top and bottom , so the rest of it is loose and likes to bunch up . Also , it never feels particularly cold , even fresh out of the freezer . It 's cold , yes , but it 's almost like it 's so insulated that you ca n't feel it very much . Does n't last very long either . I like the idea of compression + cold , and this delivers on the compression , but not so much on the cold . Better than nothing , I 'm sure , but I 'm now shopping for something better .

 These gloves are horrible.The manufacturer must have changed the material from what was used several years ago . I used to be able to reuse the gloves a half dozen times or so , but the most recent batch will not last an hour without tearing.I 'll never buy them again .
 Not only did it take from June 21st to July 8th to receive the deodorant , it arrived in what appeared to be a used condition . The sanitary cover for the actual deodorant stick was removed . And the top rim of the applicator had many cracks and a few small pieces missing . Anyone stupid enough to attempt to use this deodorant stick -LRB- and catch some rare skin disease -RRB- could possibly cut themselves under their arms . I wonder if this could have been a returned item or just one someone tried out before sending it cross country . Considering it might be contaminated I threw it out not wanting to go through the time wasting hassle of returning this piece of garbage .
 So I ordered a supply of bountiful breast off of their website . To put it simply I did see minimal growth after 2 months . My breasts were fuller feeling but there were no mind blowing results . I did n't really follow the protein shake regimen regularly -LRB- only here and there -RRB- . I would have continued taking it -LRB- because they recommend at least 3 months of it to see visible results -RRB- but I could not continue . My ovaries and uterus started killing me , so much so I went to the hospital . It must 've been because of the excess of hormones in my body -LRB- I was also using a birth control pill at the time -RRB- . It 's too bad too because the pills are so expensive so I ended up blowing a ton of money . I do n't think I 'm going to buy any enhancement products of any kind anymore ...
 Not enough information is given in the product description
 I do n't think this product works . I just think it quiets baby for a while because it 's sweet .
 The jobst donner is to narrow for large size legs . They need to make two sizes .
 I ordered 4 different Cando flexible hand bars
 I bought the `` green '' model which is supposed to be `` medium '' strength . I opened the package , tried it out and it was ridiculously hard to bend , am I am a big guy ... 6 ' 1 and 190 lbs.Having read other comments here about the quality control being way off , it was n't surprising . Anyway , I returned it to the seller at my expense `` The Therapy Connection '' and they said since I `` openened '' it , it is now `` used '' and they wo n't accept it back . They said I should have `` tried it while it was inside the plastic '' ???????? Are they serious ? WHAT A RIPOFF !!!!! Now they are unwilling to send this useless piece of junk back to me unless I Pay for shipping again !!! DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU ARE 100 % SURE YOU KNOW THE COLOR YOU WANT ! YOU WILL BE STUCK WITH IT .
 I found the same thing as the other reviewer . I only bought two
 I bought these as an inexpensive alternative to the Theraband bars . They are not of the same quality . I bought a green and a red one . There is not much difference in the resistance . They are much stiffer than the Therabars and more difficult to use . I was hoping to recommend these to my patients , but instead I recommend the original Therabars which are more expensive , but also more effective .
 Go to the grocery store and buy some sea salt . You 'll get the same quantity of salt for at leat 20 times less than what they 're charging here .
 Salt tablets used to be available at most pharmacies . That is no longer the case . Now that they are made by only a few companies , the customer who really needs this product is being grossly taken advantage of.I am using salt for the salt/vitamin C protocol for Lyme disease and came up with a much more economical solution.You can buy your own PURE sea salt for a few dollars a pound -LRB- there are approx 6 grams of salt per teaspoon -RRB- . Personally , I do n't like drinking salted water , so I have started encapsulating it at home . I use `` The Capsule Machine '' Size 00 , which costs about 15 dollars and is very easy to use . Gelatin capsules are readily available online -LRB- larger quantities are more economical -RRB- . After the initial cost of the capsule machine , my total cost for 5000 capsules is $ 70.00 -LRB- about $ 14.00 for every 1000 capsules of approx 1 gram each -RRB- . Smaller quantities might cost more -LRB- about $ 20.00 per 1000 -RRB- , but would still be significantly less than the salt tablets.Don ' t throw away your money - a very small investment can save you hundreds of dollars .
 It has been over 45 days and no product , Will neevr do business with this company again . Have sent multiple emails and had one resonse of well we guess its lost and we will send again .
 Tried these . I pretty sure this is a joke . I thought this was an herbal remedy , but it is a HOMEOPATHIC remedy , which I have learned the hard way are not the same thing . Educate yourself on the difference , because I did not and now I feel stupid . Herbal remedies contain herbs , which under research can be an active ingredient . These contain what ? 1 billionth of a billionth of a few real herbs plus lactose sugar . That is why you can basically give these to newborns , because all it really is is milk sugar . My little boy stopped crying because he thought I was giving him candy , not because this treated him . I know there are those who swear by this ... it is a pure placebo effect my friends . Again , your kids are getting a sweet , so of course they stop crying for a while . Ice those gums and give 'em a good teether , do n't get sucked into this .
 I had ordered this previously for my daughter who absolutely loved it . The next time I ordered it it was off flavored and tangy . My daughter would n't eat it and I donated it to the food bank
 This product will not stay in place no matter what ! Slides right down the leg . I tried several ways of keeping it in place . Save your money .

 The tablets I received have a tag that says mfg date 09/12 . This is confusing as this date is in the place where the expiration date should be . I assume it means manufacturing date , but if this is the case , when is the expiry date ? Because of this confusion I wo n't ingest these pills , and will return them because I want to be totally clear and certain about anything I put into my body . I am quite annoyed because I paid $ 4.99 for shipment and waited some time for its arrival.I guess I will now go to my local health food store and purchase from a manufacturer who provides unambiguous information about their product.Digestive Enzymes 180 Tabs by Swanson Premium
 These are a little to big for me -LRB- even thought I have big-uns -RRB- . They tend to get wrinkles in them and you can see them through a shirt , an under shirt , and a bra all at once . Not my favorite . They are , however very absorbant .
 These reusable nursing bra pads are bulky and show through shirts . I was very disappointed after using them the first time . Have n't used them since and have purchased others to try .
 These pads may be absorbent , but they leak like crazy . When I wear them , I still have large wet stains on my clothes . I fail to see the point of wearing the pads . I suppose they help soak up SOME of the leakage , but I certainly would n't trust these to hold back all leakage from coming through to clothing . There does n't seem to be any waterproof part - both sides are a soft flannel material . I was hoping for something that prevented my bras from getting soaked at every feeding , and these pads did not do that .
 I received a pack of these as a gift , and glad of it . Buying these myself would have resulted in some serious buyer 's remorse . These pads washed poorly the first time around , and felt `` gritty '' and a little rough to the touch . After a few more initial washings -LRB- hot water , clear detergent , no softeners -RRB- , they did n't seem to improve much but were doable if I was out of my other brand . I tried them out at home , just to see if I was being too hard on them without trying them out , and discovered that the pads ' absorption rate is poor at best , and wicking abilities are practically nonexistent . I looked like I was n't even wearing pads , except for the circular `` frames '' they created around the milk spots in my shirt . If I had known the pads would work this poorly , I would have exchanged them at the store for another brand - or even disposables . At least with disposables , I know what I 'm in for !
 I was hoping to find a more eco way of dealing with leakage than using disposables . These work in terms of absorption for me -LRB- I should qualify that to mean I leak but generally during feedings or at night and not profusely , but enough to soak 50 % of the surface of my bra at a time -RRB- . Unfortunately , they are so thick they show through my more tailored clothes -LRB- flowy , patterned tops seem to remedy much of this problem -RRB- . The stitching is rough and itchy . Once the pad is washed it 's very ripply and wo n't sit flat -LRB- which is the biggest annoyance for me -RRB- . They 're great if you plan on being a slovenly hermit at home , but I would n't want to wear them in public .
 These pads do n't provide much leak protection . Try bamboobies instead-much better leakage protection ! They also look lumpy under your bra .
 The medela ones bunch up horribly after each wash , so that they 're really lumpy and noticeable . I would never buy these again . Try Milk Diapers , especially the 4 layer ones -LRB- unless you leak heavily , then I would get the full 5 layers -RRB- . those stay nicely shaped wash after wash and I will even wear them to work because they 're discreet . Unfortunately , Amazon does n't sell Milk Diapers but look around . I bought them at our hospital 's baby boutique . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 These wrinkle up so much when you wash them and do not retain their shape at all . I only wear them at night to bed , because they show thru clothing so badly . They also do not have a large diameter that they cover , so if they shift you may still leak onto your clothes .
 I bought these prior to my son being born/before breastfeeding . I started using these in the beginning instead of the dispoables because they are less wasteful . I found these very bulky and would wake up every morning with soaking wet cotton breastpads , bra , and t-shirt . After that , I switched to the disposable medela breastpads a friend gave me to try ; they are super thin and very absorbent and only $ 10 for a month supply -LRB- you only need to use two a day , they are that absorbent -RRB- .
 Mine got all bunched up after the first washing . They 'd be really noticeable under a tshirt . I wore them overnight and woke up feeling all swampy and a bit ithcy . I only wore them once .
 very comfortable and stay put pretty well . however the slightest leak and they seem to soak through easily not recommended for those who leak a lot
 These pads did not work too well for me . They held up well in the wash but were not very absorbent . Maybe I was just leaking too much . The disposables worked best for my needs .
 I 've tried four different products . I 'm working to test each product I can get a sample of . I believe most products fit one or more specific needs . I hope my research helps you make the best choice for your needs.So far , each brand 's strengths were as follows : > Kushies -LRB- 3star -RRB- absorbed moisture immediately so they were the best inner doublers , > La Leche League -LRB- 3star -RRB- appearance was best for use in B/C nursing bras , > Medela -LRB- 2star -RRB- was easy to find in stores and absorption improved with time , > NuAngel -LRB- 4star -RRB- was very affordable . `` White/patterns '' absorb a bit faster than `` natural '' so I like to put `` natural '' as an outer doubler and `` white/patterns '' as inner doubler during heavy let-downs . If you only drip a few drops during let-down any one of these brands would be fine . Read further if moderate to heavy let-downs are common.All products were machine washable , free samples , and pre-washed in hot or warm water and cold rinse at least once before use unless otherwise noted . No fabric softeners were applied as they can cause repelling . All samples were used at least a month before final opinions were noted.Categories
 You can see these through your bra ... even a think padded bra . And they do n't lay flat so they are n't very comfortable.Try the LLLI Washable Nursing Pads . I have tried every washable brand and these are the best !
 I purchased these to try to help save the environment . I go through lots of disposable nursing pads so I thought reusable ones would be a better way to go . But these were so bulky and uncomfortable I had to quit using them . Do n't waste your money on this product .
 I have tried 4 other brands and these are the worst . I have n't had any problems with leakage -LRB- with this or any other brand -RRB- but after 3-4 washes the Medela pads are so wrinkled and have lost their shape that I ca n't wear them with anything without them showing through . I would not recommend these unless you were going to hand wash them - but who has time with a new babe ! Especially , when the other brands are holding up just fine after the same number of washes .
 I bought this thinking it was a natural & safe sleep aid . I read that it is supposed to help people suffering from IBS . Desperate times call for desprate measures & my sleep was n't great , so I figured it was harmeless to try . Since then I have become a tad bit more educated on Melatonin . The main thing a person needs to know is that prolonged use of Melatonin can reduce the bodies ability to create it 's own Melatoinin making you dependent on it for sleep . This hardly sounds like a good thing to me . I would like to hope that this is a least a safer alternative to those nasty prescription pills out there and if you truly need a sleep aid , then this might be your best & safest shot.Not Natural : On the Natrol Melatonin bottle in the Supplement Facts it saysMelatonin -LRB- synthetic -RRB- 5mg . This in combination of the possibility of becoming dependent on it for my precious sleep , has brought me to the decision to immediately stop taking these!On a final note
 There was no increase in muscle mass , it just made me pee more . I did also gain some water weight . Would not recommend .
 The title says `` Tom 's of Maine Anticavity Fluoride Toothpaste - Peppermint Baking Soda 6 Oz . -LRB- Pack of 3 -RRB- '' but was only sent a single tube of toothpaste .
 Item description says pack of 3 but product features section says `` one 6 oz tube '' . Descriptions are conflicting and buyer can not be confident about the product .
 This set sounds like a good idea , but it has never worked for me ! My son has taken a pacifier since he was a week old , but he hates this one ! The surface is too flat and hard , he will never keep it in his mouth . I have never been able to get the display to work properly , it only displays partial numbers . I have always used a rectal reading for him -LRB- Safety First 10 Second Safety thermometer is GREAT !!!! -RRB- .
 I registered for this item thinking it would be a great idea . I tried it out on myself , and after five minutes , it was still trying to read my temperature . I immediately returned it to the store !
 the concept is good , but not if your child does n't take a pacifier . my daughter sucked her thumb so I thought maybe this would work -LRB- so I would n't have to take it rectally -RRB- but she kept spitting it out and sucking her thumb instead . so I just gave up on it . My doctor would n't accept this reading anyway so it was a waste of money . -LRB- for me anyway .
 I have a binky thermometer that is a different brand then this one but it works the same . I bought it thinking it was a good way to take my son 's temperature , but after trying to use it twice I realize I should n't have wasted the money on it . My son is used to latex binkies and the nipple on this thermometer is silicone so he did n't want to keep it in his mouth . It also took about 3 minutes to get a reading , not the 90 seconds the package tells you . You 're far better off just getting a -LSB- $ $ $ -RSB- rectal/oral one at your local pharmacy store .
 But now when I needed it again I turned it on it came on fine but it would not read the my daughters temperature . I tryed it on myself and still it just kept blinking a `` 7 '' . I am going to write to the manufacturer and see what they can do . My daughter is only 4 months old I figured this would last longer then four months and 2 trys .
 I bought this at Target recently . I wondered why they were all on sale . I love the lotion and the light scent , so I got the baby oil . I have not stopped itching since putting it on a couple of days ago . I need to change my linen , etc. . Something in this oil is causing me to itch . I saw that others were having the same problem on other sites .
 Wwell ... I had been really psyched to try this out . All about the natural toothpastes , and I tried this specifically for the xylitol . Plus I like apricots ... Now , I use it and Im like ... ok there is some non reg . toothpastey taste ... ok.Teeth getting cleaned.Ok feeling refreshed afterwards.All good right?But the stuff also leaves a unpleasant just because its weird chalky taste in my mouth . And when I wake in the morning , its a weird feeling.I suppose my mouth was n't as dry , anymore ... even though Ive gone back to not drinking much during the day at all . But it always had this weird thing to it . Maybe this is too much ` nature ' for me . Too natural . Perhaps Im too used to regular aqua fresh or any of the other leading brands.I like getting brushed and not being chalky however slightly.And the taste of the tooth paste is more haunting than the outright blast of flavors for other pastes ... Well ... Ive stopped using this one , only after using it for 3 days.I probably will switch back and forth iwth my reg . toothpaste though , since I paid for it .
 I used this thermometer pacifier and it 's never had an accurate temp . Not to mention that the regular pacifier I would n't recommend using it at all , my daughter used it and she almost choked on it , it fell apart on her and the nipple was the only thing in her mouth nearly down her throat . It ' a a good thing it was time for her to wake up or she would n't be here today.I WOULD NOT USE THIS PRODUCT AT ALL .
 The thermometers are inaccurate . I have not used them more than once . The only useful thing in this set is the medicine dispenser ... just buy a medicine dispenser on its own .
 Good luck getting your baby to use this pacifier ! If they have a regular one they use , they will know the difference ! Trust me . This is not for you if you have a picky baby !
 I 'm borderline anemic and these vitamins help me to control that . I try to take these daily but either schedule or early alzheimer 's gets in the way . ;-RRB- When I take them , there is definitely a noticeable difference in my mood , appetite and digestion . If , for some reason , I forget to take these before/during my period , I get very weak . Everyone has problems taking vitamins consistently . I can definitely say that when I take these , I 'm a much better person.Update 09/01/11 : I noticed that I would frequently get migraines after I took these vitamins . I stopped taking them for a month and although I felt some anemic weakness , the migraines did stop . I switched to a different brand and so far , so good . In addition , these vitamins get moldy at the slightest tinge of humidity , which is difficult to control .
 This multivitamin causes me to throw up . I 've been taking gummi vitamins and Floradix before I tried to make the switch to this more affordable multi + iron.The first morning I thought that throwing up was a fluke . But this morning , sure enough -- 5 minutes after taking the vitamin and while I was making my oatmeal , I had to run to the bathroom and throw up . I 'm definitely not pregnant . I have n't felt nauseous at any other point during these two days . The vitamin is the only change . What a drag .
 I 've used a similar product from a different manufacturer with more favorable results . In this case , the product worked to a degree but was gone before it could be effectively applied to a surface area of only a couple of inches . I wo n't buy it again .
 I used this in my smoothies a few times and then just gave up using it . It clumps up and does n't mix in at all even with a blender . I recommend you just buy medamucil if your looking for something with fiber , it definitely mixes better than this product and it 's made from psyllium husks .
 This stuff may do the job for some but I could not handle the taste and the consistancy . And taking it 3 times a day was just not going to happen . I gave up and will find something else .
 This arrived very quickly , so service is great . However , the product did not prove helpful for me in dealing with constipation .
 THIS PRODUCT IS AN OK PRODUCT . WHAT I LEARNED AFTER I PURCHASED IT WAS THAT PGX WAS A MUCH BETTER PRODUCT THEN THIS PRODUCT .
 The things I like about these containers are that you can nest them and they seal really well.Although Ziploc advertises that you can use their containers safely in the freezer , almost every Ziploc container we 've put in the freezer has broken . They usually break right at the bottom corners . If you do use them in the freezer anyway , they seem less likely to break if they 're filled with fluids than if they 're filled with solid foods .
 These have already started cracking . I hand wash only , no dishwasher . So , I am not thrilled with the quality.We do use them daily for school lunches . Love that we can fit them in the lunch boxes and they do n't leak , but I wish they would last longer !
 From packing sandwich for lunch to storing left-over , Ziploc is well-known for its variety of food storing products . I have been using the Ziploc brand containers since high school , and I must say this purchase from Amazon disappointed a lot . I 'm not saying this is Amazon 's fault , but I have also checked Ziploc products in retail stores like Wal-mart and Target ; the quality of Ziploc went down and very down.One thing I hate the most , nowadays many companies say go GREEN by reducing the materials manufacturing their product . Yes , Ziploc is one of the case , and they make themselves look bad . People buy Ziploc because of their quality product likes sturdy plastic box and holding-firm lid . It 's no longer a good product that I trust . The box bends in my lunch box leaving stretching lines which makes the lid hardly fits . The lid does n't firmly snap to brand new container.By the time I 'm writing this review , I have already switched to Rubbermaid . Ziploc now to me is just same as wal-mart brand product , Great Value .
 I just received these a week ago and I 've been eating them ever since . I thought this was suppose to help curb my appetite , but it does n't ! I do n't know if it 's just me , but once I 'm done eating a lollipop I 'm hungry for food . I figured maybe it was just the first time , but every other time I ate a lollipop , I would get extremely hungry right after . I will admit it tastes good but it does n't do what it 's claiming . I have n't lost any weight , at all .
 These taste good . They do not curb my appetite and they are sooo expensive ! I used them to help with sugar craving on the hcg diet . Helped with craving but Im going to try sugar free pops ?
 It has to be good if I order it in from the USA into Canada ... and the cost of the floss is expensive but the shipping is double so the 6 packs cost me $ 50 + ... again , it has to be good to pay that kind of money ! It is the best floss on the market !
 This product made absolutely no difference in my digestive symptoms . It also tastes terrible , and is hard to measure a dose , since the dosage is measured in drops but it did n't come with a dropper .
 I took Iberogast faithfully for two weeks before every meal and saw absolutely no change at all . Actually , when I took it , it made my stomach a bit queasy . I sure wish it worked ; back to the drawing board ... : -LRB-
 I received these vitamins in bad shape with the seal broken . I immediately sent an e-mail telling the seller this and never heard anything back from anyone . I threw the vitamins away as I think when the seal is broken on the bottle it is a danger to anyone to take them .
 Strap does not have any give to it , becoming more of a tourniquet than a support brace . As a racquetball player , for the brace to become effective -LRB- immobilize the aggravated tendon on the innerside of the elbow -RRB- I had to tighten the strap significantly . Since there is no elasticity in the strap , after a half hour my arm was sore from the tightness of the strap . Recommed staying away from this type of brace . If you are playing sports , such as tennis or racquetball , where you are constantly gripping a racquet and need an effective elbow brace , recommend you get Futuro Elbow Support With Pressure Pads .
 I would n't buy these again . Firstly , I could not withdraw a sheet from the center of the roll without tearing the edge . I finally had to pull out the entire center which consisted of perhaps a third of all available sheets , then I could n't reinsert those that I did n't need to use . I wrapped those in saran plastic wrap for later use . I also wrapped the entire container in saran wrap to keep the towelettes moist for later use . I really could n't see any before and after difference .
 Product purchased based on reviews but did not work as advertised . Very difficult to extract from container and left streaks on stainless steel appliances . Found a much better product at Home Depot called STEEL MEISTER . It works !
 I really wanted these to work . They clean the steel , however , what they leave behind is sometimes worse . On my refrigerator , they leave streaks and oil droplets . On my stove , they leave very noticeable dust particles , where I have to clean between knobs . Additionally , they have left scratches around the knobs of my stove , even though I was very careful to clean with the lightest touch . I am going back to the spray cleaner and microcloth . It is not as convenient , but does a much better job and wo n't scratch my appliances as easily .
 I 've used other brands that out perform this one . Spend a few dollars more , it might be worth it . These leave streaks .
 The pluses - it was comfortable , reasonably priced . The minus was that it did not cover enough of my thumb to be of use to keep my `` trigger thumb '' from bending - which hurts a lot . I have a small hand , I ordered the small size , but the thumb part did n't extend high enough to immobilize my thumb . I did not return it because after just one day 's wear , the stitching was coming loose at the top of the thumb sleeve so I just skipped it . For anyone with this problem , just wrap your thumb with about two turns of that self-sticking bandage wrap stuff that 's available in different widths - I use 1 '' - and is flesh tone which frankly looks better than a bright blue thing that everyone feels compelled to ask you about . Unless you like that sort of thing !
 The thumb opening is too tight ; there 's a piece of the appliance that hangs out below the wrist wrap serving no apparent purpose ; and the entire unit does not come down low enough on your wrist or wrap it tightly enough to do any good . If it was n't such a hassle to return stuff , I 'd return it .
 the idea is sound but they only put one piece of Velcro on , and it is on the wrist rap . what happens is that as you move your hand the piece that is supposed to come down and be secured by the wrist wrap , slips . Pretty soon the whole thing works its way loose . Not at all useful . A big waste of money .
 After my initial recovery from an RCL tear in my left thumb -LRB- 7 weeks in a cast , 8 weeks in a removable hard splint , and 11 weeks of OT -RRB- , I was looking for a brace that would support my thumb but allow movement of my wrist . I 'm pretty active in exercise -LRB- swimming , yoga , Pilates , aerobics , water aerobics , weight training -RRB- , so I needed something that I could wear while doing these activities . The CHAMPION Neoprene Wrist/Thumb Support did not have the support I was looking for . I wore it once during a water aerobics class and in order to get any support from this item I had to adjust the tightness to the point that my hand went numb . This product would be great if it had some support bars along the sides and top of the thumb .
 Bought one for my wife when she was experiencing pain in wrist and thumb from holding our newborn . Measured her wrist to be about 5.9 inches in circumference , so it is within the range recommended for the small size . With the Velcro strap aligned properly , it was too loose and did not provide much wrist support at all . To get it tighter , we had to stick the velcro on the blue part of the wrap . However , wearing it tight like this to support the wrist caused thumb numbness after a few minutes , so she stopped using it .
 LB-51 can not be used directly with the i70 or i80 printer . It needs the housing that is only available within the CK-51 or LK-51 -LRB- of which , the LB-51 is part of those packages -RRB-
 this product is much wider than it appears . - probably would not purchase this type of item again without having all the dimensions .
 I really should have paid attention to some of the reviews on this product . The odor is absolutely horrid and was left behind on everything it came in contact with . It was so bad I had to toss it in the trash .
 like the size but do n't like the smell . it 's kinda strong chemical smell and will not go away after many washing ...
 I got this for my wife and I , but we 've never gotten any use out of it . First of all , this thing is simply way too wide . That is n't necessarily a bad thing for everyone , but the next thing is . Whatever this is made out of , it burns . It burns the tongue and mouth , the vagina , even the skin . We have other toys of similar design , and none do this . It ca n't be any sort of allergy , because it affected both wife and I and we have completely different skin types . Anyways , if you can bear the size , you probably wo n't enjoy the burning .
 I would not recommend buying this as it is made out of some kind of rubber product that burns after using it for just a few min . . girlfriend was none too happy to say the least . . would be a nice product if it were made of some other type of material .
 I 'm probably the realistic target market for an item of this dimension - a male size queen . It 's the right width for me , working on depth . But this is n't the right toy to do it.Y ` know all those warnings on the 8-inch variation about how there 's something wrong with this and it burns the exact sensitive tissues you 'd be using it with ? This has the exact same problem . It 's too large to use condoms as a workaround.Mine was packaged plastic-sealed over a cardboard backing . The cardboard backing had a moisture stain pattern obviously related to where it was contacting the toy . There 's definitely something chemically wrong with this product .
 I do not know what material this is made of , but it left intense burning . Can only be used wit a condom . I would not recommend this brand !
 I love the feel of the terry cloth but the cover shrinked at the first washing !! Also , it is starting to unravel and strings are poking out everywhere ! Color selection is great , but that 's it !!
 Great concept , love how they 're terry cloth , and you could n't ask for more color choices ... but , after washing them , they do n't fit ! The corners of my changing pad -LRB- and yes , it is the once that 's made to go with these covers -RRB- are all smashed from forcing it into these covers . Mine are also covered with little lint balls after repeated washings , and obviously a changing pad cover necessitates repeated washings !
 I registered for the terry changing pad cover thinking it was a good price and should do the trick !! I was WRONG !!! It started to unravel after the first washing and the softness goes away immediately . Spend the extra money and purchase the Chamois Cover from Pottery Barn Kids . It is worth the extra $ 5 . I have two of them and they wash EXTREMELY well -LRB- stays soft , stains come out , etc. -RRB- and it has slits for the safety belt . If your baby is anything like mine he is on his changing pad quite a bit and I think he really likes the softness of the Chamois material .
 I was disapointed with the quality of the product . It ripped after one wash .
 My husband and I bought two of these covers in preparation for the birth of our son . The first time I washed both covers -LRB- according to the instructions -RRB- , neither survived . Both covers emerged from the wash frayed and with holes . Considering that these are items that will require plenty of washing in the future , we were very disappointed with the quality . Also , at $ 12.99 a pop , we expected better quality .
 After a few washings , this cover looks horrible . The thread comes loose from the elastic , and there is fuzz imbedded in it . The Especially for Baby brand is a lot better & the cover also doubles as a co-sleeper mattress cover .
 This item is serviceable and probably something you could buy to use to basically get ruined without stressing about it . The Wendy Bellisimo changing pad covers are only $ 2 more and much better quality fabric . The terry used for these is very cheap and scratchy , like an old towel . I am using them but am not fussed on how long they last or what happens to them , I wo n't be buying any more though . Carter 's also makes lap pads that are great for use over the changing pad . You do n't strictly speaking need a cover , it 's easier if you do n't use one . I never used covers with DD and never had a problem .
 well i bought this and washed it more than i used it ! it was much easier to just wipe down the changing pad , then to have to wash the cover all the freakin time !
 In the washing machine , this pad gave off lint that got stuck to the rest of the wash , and fills the lint trap in the dryer . It really made a mess of my laundry . I do n't recommend it at all .
 I read the books that suggested getting a cover for the changing pad , and I put it on when I was putting our room together . It gives a finishing look to our Changing table -- however once we brought our son home , we ended up changing it everytime we changed him . Granted it 's our first child , so maybe you will be much neater when changing your baby , but we are pretty good at it now , and I still would n't put it on . It 's just another thing to wash -- and he loves lying on the Changing pad with no cover . It 's nice to look at , but not necessary .
 Washed it once according to directions & it shrunk beyond belief ! Did n't even use it once ! Do n't bother !!! Just use a pillowcase & it works just as well ...
 I have a newborn and have washed this cover twice -LRB- on warm / cold -RRB- and it barely fits over my standard size contoured changing pad . In fact , the cover is so tight that it is causing the pad to become mis-shapen .
 I prewashed this item as instructed ... lost half of it in the dryer lint vent and fought tooth and nail to try to get it to fit over the changing pad . It is WAY TOO SMALL and NOT QUALITY MATERIAL . But then again , I 've learned to expect poor quality from Babies R Us ... Horrible .
 I really disliked this product . First , once it was washed it shrunk and would not fit properly on the pad . I bought a standard contoured pad from Babies ' R Us and so it should have been compatible . Second , it 's too much of a pain to keep taking it off , washing it and putting it back on . I have three of these and now do n't use any . If your baby remotely spits up or goes to the bathroom while on the changing table -LRB- before you get a new diaper on -RRB- I 've found it 's easier to buy some nice inexpensive matching towels and lay them over the pad . They 're cheaper and you do n't have to worry about fit .
 This cover is soft terry cloth , but we bought the safety changing table pad deluxe by Dex Baby Products and you do not need this item -LRB- we returned ours -RRB- . If your baby ever has an accident while you are changing them , you will end up washing more then you should have to . We just use the pad which is vinyl & easy to wipe down after changing .
 The quality of this changing pad cover is very , very low . After only one washing , I had loose threads all over and the terry had already snagged . Now , after months of continued use and turning a blind eye to all it 's imperfections , the terry material is pulling away from the elastic edging . The Especially for Baby brand changing pad cover is so much better
 I tried this cover on before I washed it and it fit perfectly fine . After I washed it and tried to use it , it had shrunk at least 1.5 inches in length . Terrible product ...
 These covers shrink in the washing machine . The cover now bends the changing pad causing it to rip in places . I will now need to purchase a new changing pad . The cover now measures 27 or 28 inches long instead of the original 32 inches it started out as . This is after only 2 months of use .
 I really like the color selection and the softness of this product , but I am very disappointed by the shrinkage . The cover barely fits over the pad -LRB- were n't they made to go together ? -RRB- and the pad itself it turning up at the corners . When I lay my baby down on the pad , he is comfortable , but he sinks into the pad because it does n't fit properly . It does look nice , though in our nursery , but if I could do it over I would have selected a different pad and cover .
 This is an attractive cover , but oddly , it 's way too hard to get on the pad it 's designed for . The first time it was difficult to put on , but looked ok . After repeated washings , it 's getting worse and is bending my changing pad . the ends are all smushed down . What a bummer .
 I have a standard sized -LRB- 16x32 -RRB- changing pad and I bought this cover for it because I liked the color . I was extremely disappointed because it will not fit , no matter how hard I try to stretch it . I am returning this .
 This product did absolutely nothing for me - in fact my PSA went higher after its use . I have changed products
 After about two months of use , I have mixed feelings about these . Noticed a marked improvement in the height of raised scars -LRB- they are much smoother -RRB- but no improvements otherwise -LRB- in color/size -RRB- , meaning scars that were not raised already have shown no improvement.Biggest complaint is that they just do n't stick well . When you first open a new one , it will probably stick well for about a 12 hours -LRB- the recommended amount of time to wear one in a day -RRB- , as long as you are n't too hairy -LRB- and I am , they peel off my arms right away -RRB- . But you are supposed to be able to re-use them for several days - yet after the first day , they barely stick at all -LRB- the directions say to wash them every day with water - I was skeptical at first that this would help , but it actually makes them stick better - just not well enough -RRB- . Do n't even think about wearing them at night without tape - they will peel off and get lost -LRB- or stuck in your hair :P -RRB- . Overall : The Good : - seem to work well on raised scars - bandages are fairly large , by cutting them up i can cover 3 scars with one bandage - are good for about 5-6 days if you keep taping them downThe Bad - do n't stick - whatever you pay for these , expect to pay about that much again in medical tape -LRB- i use scotch tape because i am cheap -RRB- - have n't helped with the color or size of scars -LRB- i do n't really care that much , i was just curious if these would work - but for most people , i imagine this is the most important aspect -RRB- Final Word :2 stars , until I see more improvement . If you are particularly worried about your scars , I recommend seeing a dermatologist before you plop down 30 bucks for these .
 Well , after much thought on which scar product to use on my two recent scars , I went with this one because it was cheaper than the other patches . The Curad ones only contain a 21 day supply and cost $ 20 so for the 12 weeks it is going to cost like $ 80 . So I went with the Neosporin and medical tape . I had read that these do n't stick but I found that I ca n't even get mine to stick right after peeling them off ! But I bought some medical tape which keeps them on ... shame though because one of the scars is on my face :-LRB- so everyone keeps asking me what happened since I have what looks like a bandage taped on my forehead . I do have to say that after only a week of use I have noticed a difference in size of the keloid scar on my hand so that is awesome ! I have yet to notice a difference on the regular scar on my face but it has only been a week , so I 'll see how it goes . I would still recommend these over the Curad ones since it is by far cheaper , but for the vain I would go with the Curad since I have read that they stick better and are more discreet .
 I started using these 3 weeks ago - on three small keloid scars . Not sure if they 're working or not , but I 've lost half the box on having them roll off . I agree - you can end up spending a LOT on medical tape and make things look much worse then they are . Today I tried a little superglue along the edges and will see . I wrote to Pfizer ... will see and will return with more results . Pfizer replied promptly with full refund - sure have to admire that !
 Does n't stick , is thick & ugly , and does n't work . Even when reinforced with various kinds of bandage tape , in the morning I would find `` migrated patches '' on my bed sheets or PJs . Also , I saw no improvement in my leg scars .
 I used it for about 6 weeks and saw only marginal improvement . I was treating two scars , so I was n't about to go drop another $ 30 on something that was n't working too well to begin with . I also had problems with them staying on ; they made me sweat under the patches and then they 'd bunch up and fall off . Not recommended .
 This product is a total waist of money . The adhesive does n't work , they wo n't stay on for five minutes . I have used every scar product on the market and this is by far the worst .
 I tried these `` medical '' support pantyhose in my search for the perfect pair of support hose to help the venous return problem in one of my legs . I found them to be expensive and a little on the short side . I found them to fit poorly too . After wearing them for about 2 hours , they started to bag around my ankles and knees . I had to go to the restroom and pull them up every two hours try to reduce the bagging . They also did n't hold up better than the Futuro pantyhose I bought and I could n't tell the difference between the Futuro pantyhose and the Jobst pantyhose when I took them out of the package !! They are fairly sheer , have a slight sheen , more like regular support pantyhose , if you are looking for a pair of pantyhose that offer sheerness without looking like medical grade support hose .
 I was looking for something to soothe my aching legs during frequent air travel , but these ripped as I was putting them on for the first time . What a waste !
 I am waiting for the pantyhoses . They sent the wrong color.I returned them.Elena
 I 've bought and used this product locally at thehealth food store for years . This time I purchasedthe larger size to save money from Amazon.The product from the health food store was sealedand the tablets were fresh with a hard shell andslight vitamin smell.The product from Amazon was also sealed , but thetablets were softer and had a heavy vitamin smell.This condition results from having the tabletsexposed to the air for at least a months time.This tells me that the tablets sat out at thefactory and aged , then packaged and shipped.Its a shame ! I 'll go back to buying locally inthe smaller quantity again , or start looking fora similar product . So it goes with products intodays world . No integrity !
 The product came in out of date . this is the first time I 've had this problem.I guess this product got out of rotation . so I threw them away.I have been a long time customer and I am unsure if I will reorder . Sorry , God Bless Ralph E Bard
 I will begin this heavy-handed review by saying that there is very little objective information that can be used to rate a vitamin supplement . Nonetheless , there is an interesting phenomenon that seems to have occurred in the reviews of this product
 I have just started taking this supplement , so I do not have a change in energy or anything else related to report ... yet . I do , however , have a very difficult time swallowing these because they are absolutely huge . I tried cutting them with the pill cutter but the edges were so sharp it hurt when I swallowed them . It 's not possible to cut them and round off edges since they easily crumble . Trying to blend them into a drink is not an option due to the very strong taste .
 this product is much wider than it appears . - probably would not purchase this type of item again without having all the dimensions .
 I really should have paid attention to some of the reviews on this product . The odor is absolutely horrid and was left behind on everything it came in contact with . It was so bad I had to toss it in the trash .
 like the size but do n't like the smell . it 's kinda strong chemical smell and will not go away after many washing ...
 I got this for my wife and I , but we 've never gotten any use out of it . First of all , this thing is simply way too wide .

 People ... please do n't get ripped off . I went to Walgreens and got a large 50 count of underlayment pads that fit perfectly on our changing table for 3.99 Please do n't fall victim to the cute designs and baby marketing gimmicks . These work ... but you can get the exact same thing at your pharmacy for much much less .
 These are $ 5 more than the box of 36 Sassy Baby Changing pads , also sold on Amazon . The Sassy ones also work better in my opinion . Skip these and save yourself some money .
 I bought these to use as changing pads . They are too small -LRB- even though my daughter is a small 5-month-old -RRB- , so if there is a diaper accident while changing it ca n't really absorb everything , and they tear VERY easily -- my husband tears one almost every time he changes the baby .
 Picture shows pretty pattern this is why I ordered them . However , I only received solid white ones instead in a timely fashion . Did n't complain , maybe should .
 These are very small in size and `` paper-towel-like '' , kinda feel like napkins that are made with recycled paper . We bought a pack and just could n't use it because it is so small . I 'd rather just use paper towel instead if I were to use these . For us we now use the babies R Us brand , they are much bigger and has a plastic feel to it , which is much more durable .
 These pads do NOT absorb pee ! My baby girl likes to pee when her diaper has just been taken off inbetween me taking the dirty diaper away and putting the new one under her . If she pees on this pad , it runs all over the place , including on her and onto the cotton changing pad that I am trying to protect -LRB- defeating the purpose of my buying these pads -RRB- . The Huggies brand has only 8 in a package , but they are MUCH larger and they absorb pee . Do not waste your money on PeeWee pads !
 Unfortunately , these feel flimsy and cheap . Would not recommend buying . They also crinkle underneath my daughter while she squirms on the changing table .
 I order these all the time from another company and love them but the other company ran out of stock so I ordered them here . They came with partial water spots on them . As if the were in a puddle and then they dried . Gross , I had to throw half of them out . I know it was n't the mail because the outer package was n't wet and they were wrapped in plastic . I think this happened at the warehouse and they still shipped them to me .
 This item was exactly what I needed but for some reason I thought I was getting a lot more than I got . My fault , sure , but it does n't really excuse selling $ 3 worth of something for $ 10 , does it ?
 If anyone is looking to buy this product , please read the description carefully . The picture makes this look like a regular size jar , .63 oz , of Tiger Balm . In actuality , what comes is not the same thing as the picture . Also , i believe the seller uses grams instead of ounces to intentionally misguide buyers . What I recieved in the mail was a tiny red tin , about the size of my thumb , from the tip to the first knuckle . The amount in ounces is .14 oz . I am really disappointed in this product and feel as if I have been , if not directly lied to , then at the very least grossly mislead .
 I tried using this with my daughter and she frowns and spits it out before I can get her temp . She is very picky ; I think most babies are picky about what types of pacifiers they take ... mine only takes NUK . She gets this thing in her mouth and it 's not shaped like her regular binky so she wo n't keep it in her mouth . The bulb seems to be too long . She gagged on it . I only tried it once and decided to you a digital thermometer which is a better way to go .
 I thought his was a great idea when I saw it so I bought it . My daughter wouldnt take it because of the shape and its not something you can sterilize with out ruining it !
 I received this as a gift before my daughter was born and thought it was a pretty neat idea . After she arrived and I tried to use it one night , I found out quite differently ! When I placed the pacifier in her mouth , if she 'd been able to speak , she would have said something like `` What is this ? '' and proceeded to promptly SPIT it out . I tried a second time and got the same response . We have always used the Avent pacifiers and this thermometer is shaped quite differently . If you have a baby that is n't used to this type of pacifier , buying this thermometer will be a waste of money . Ours is in a drawer and will never be used . We 're sticking with the regular thermometer .
 This is a good idea in theory , however , it just did n't work for us . Our son took a pacifier with no problems , but he knew this was different and just did n't want to hang on to it . Even though taking a rectal temp is no joy in itself , it 's the best way to get an acurate reading . It 's all our doctor 's office would really take .
 I do n't know about the other women who have reviewed this product but I knew what they had to say was slightly overdone . Sure the product does smell like rubber/latex . That 's why you wash it off first . -LRB- plus . what is a condom made of ? ;p -RRB- . The picture does make the penis bigger than it is in person . That I agree on but - It is n't a bad thing . I 'm not trying to turn my vagina into a garbage bag . This product is PERFECT for hitting/rubbing your g-spot . if you are looking to feel it go deep inside of you ramming your insides - this is n't the product for you . Also the blue latex keeps the vibrator cool and not hot if you keep it on longer than 30 minutes -LRB- we are all guilty ;p -RRB- . - June 2 , 2012 _______________________________________________________ 7/9/2012I promised I would review again after future use . It is been almost 2 months since I purchased this item and I have highly changed my mind on this product . The rubber is extremely malleable . After extreme use the product does not wrap fully around the head of my hitachi vibrator . The rubber is cheap and not worth the asking price . I 'm going to have to throw this out 57 days after purchasing this item because now I can feel the heat from the hitachi head because this product is NOT meant to last . Highly disappointed !
 tossed it in the garbage after finding it had melted plastic it was in contact with . similar to the way artificial worms in a tackle box will melt hard plastic.would not buy again or let my wife use , must be pthlates or something like that .
 Was a little dissapointed in the product , not as big as it seems in the picture and not as high quality as some of the other attachments we have purchased .
 First , it was pictured as a handle and 2 boxes of cartridges . What came was a handle with 2 cartridges . After using it , I would not recommend it . It gives a rough shave -LRB- hard on the skin -RRB- and the blades have a tendency to pop out of the handle . Back to Gillette for me .
 got screwed on this one , all you get is the razor body and two individual razors , not two packages of razors as pictured . what a waste of money . but at least they are super sharp blades and last a very long time .
 So I have had this for over a year now ... and it still stinks ! Not to mention that the type of rubber is very sticky ... . and will pick up any bit of lint.Save your money and try something else ...
 I had decided to buy my toys off of amazon because of the huge price difference everywhere else is so expensive ... But I guess price does matter I bought several different toys off of here and im not really happy with any of them , The size of this is very short the girth is good but the length is way shorter than what I thought it was going to be I dont know if me and my partner will even be able to use this together . . And It also like the others had a very strong chemical smell to it but I hope it will go away with some washing !!
 This product does leave a mark on your skin as it implies . However the `` ink '' is very gummy and hard to get a good coverage on the design . The package states that the design will be a bluish black , but after leaving it on the skin , it looks like washed magic marker . it is not dark at all . the covering that you must put over it to set the design prevents you from seeing if any of the ink has seeped out side the design area , creating the problem of stray splotches of `` ink '' other than the design . i do not reccommend this product at all .
 One of the 3 bottles spilled all over the packaging . A second bottle lost some of the after shave liquid and the third bottle was unwrapped with the top popped off but maintained the most amount of liquid . The three bottles were tightly wrapped in bubble wrapping but no extra reinforcement was added to the bottle top that does not twist , pop , or lock on top of the bottle . When I repackaged the 2 remaining bottles for Christmas I made sure to tape the top on and wrap in skrink wrap to ensure a spillage would not occur again .
 Though this would help with indigestion and weight loss because I have gained about 20 pounds over 4 years after gallbaldder removal due to pancreatitus and it really did nether of those . Sitting on top of the fridge collecting dust . Would n't reccomend trying it .
 Ox Bile is essential in helping with digestion of fats in older people or in people who have had their gallbladder removed but this dose is very high . I spent the night of the first dose in great pain , throwing up a very strong acid bile that burned my throat and mouth for hours . The diarrhea was just as painful and it took several hours to clear my system . 3 different bouts of vomiting and diarrhea . Just beware if you are a first time use of Ox Bile , to take a smaller dose , start out with 125 mg and work up as needed . I will purchase some empty gelcaps and break down the doses to manageable levels so it is not a waste of money , but it was sure a shock to my system .
 I was excited to try this product especially reading that it helps in absorption of foods after having the gallbladder removed.I took these as it said on the label , however , I had some serious adverse reactions to these . They made me sick to my stomach as though I had diarrhea . Perhaps the strength was too strong for me , but I threw these out ! Perhaps I will try the one 's that are 125mg .
 This product did not do anything for me that I could notice . They have you taking an insanely amount of pills 30minutes before your meals . I followed the directions exactly and have been watching what I 've eaten . My cravings have not gotten any better and I have not felt any more energy than usual . I would not recommend this product again but Natures Secret is not a bad company . I purchased 15-Day Weight Loss Cleanse & Flush through them from Amazon and found it to help me more , with more regular bowel movements and slight energy increase .
 I asked for the Opalescence that takes only 30 minutes . Instead received the type that takes ALL NIGHT !!!! I returned it , requesting the 30 minute tyep again . Received the variety that takes SEVERAL HOURS !!! I am returning it and asking for a refund.Who in the world would want an all-night teeth whitener ???
 I have purchased the 15 % Opalescence formula in the past with good results . This time around I noticed little difference in the whitening effect . Since there was no `` use by '' date on the package I am wondering if the product sent was on the shelf too long , simply a bad batch , or even possibly a knock off .
 As a dentist , I know that the key to success in tooth whitening is to have a properly made custom-fitted tray , and the right concentration of bleaching gel.This product markets a 20 % Carbamide-Peroxide bleaching gel . The 20 % concentration is considered strong in comparison to the concentrations available . Most at-home systems use a 10-15 % concentration of Carbamide Peroxide.The MAJOR drawback to this system is that it assumes that you have a custom-moulded bleaching tray , which is essential to using this product correctly and safely . IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A CUSTOM-MOULDED MOUTH TRAY , DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT . A custom-moulded tray must fit the teeth precisely and must not allow the bleaching gel to leak from the tray . A properly moulded tray will have a reservior for the gel , and a contoured scalloped border that prevents the gel from coming into contact with the gum tissues . -LRB- Sustained contact of the bleaching gel with gum tissues will result in a white chemical burn -RRB- . Since this product does not have a custom tray , I can not wholeheartedly recommend it therefore giving it an overall score of 2-stars . However , if you have a custom-moulded tray -LRB- not an at-home heat moulded -LRB- boiled -RRB- system -RRB- , this is an effective product if used in moderation and according to instructions -LRB- in that case I give it 3 stars -RRB- . I actually think that a 20 % bleaching solution is too strong to be used unsupervised . A 20 % solution will likely cause tooth sensitivity and has the additional likelihood of causing chemical burns of the gums . It must be used with caution and restraint.Keep in mind that Crest and others offer a tray-less system -LRB- no gel -RRB- , as the gel is impregnated in the adhesive strip that is applied to the teeth . These systems work well and are fairly cheap to use . The advantage with the custom-made tray system is that you can use a variety of different bleaching gel strengths , some of which are much stronger than the adherant strip systems.Jim `` Konedog '' Koenig -LRB- dentist -RRB-
 Have used the product as directed several times and saw no improvement in the whiteness of my teeth whatsoever . Wouldnt recommend it to anyone .
 I bought this with the assumption it was the same product I bought at the dentist . I 've used it twice and it is about 1/3 of the strength -LRB- same % -RRB- that I got from the dentist . No white teeth her . I wo n't buy from this seller again . Next time I 'll go to the dentist .
 I bought a jar of Tiger Balm in Thailand that has lasted for years , and when I ran out , I searched for it on Amazon and purchased this . It 's not the same formula , and it is causing chafing on any part of my skin that I apply it . I would return it if I still had the packaging .
 I ca n't complain about the message this machine produces as I have n't used it much ! lol I got this machine few months ago and still ca n't use it as it produces a huge amount of harsh vibrations that reaches the handles which makes it really difficult to hold . I tried to convince my wife to use it on me but she always refuses preferring to make it with bare hands saying `` It really hurts '' ! also as soon as you plug and operate this machine it produces a very very noisy and scary sound that really freaks me out every time i try to operate it . It feels as if it 's going to explode or at least burn.If i had the chance to return it I 'd definitely do , too bad I ca n't as I already left the US
 My husband is a retired massage therapist . He suggested we purchase the Jeanie Rub because he thought it would be great ! However , it is not . Not only is the unit extremely loud , but it 's heavy and uncomfortable . Basically , it does n't do much . You can barely feel anything and the attachment package does not help . It 's a pain to unscrew the screws for the attachments , also . For the price , I expected something I could use with certain points . This thing vibrates so much , it hurts my hands to hold it .
 Bought this after all the great reviews . Got it Sept. 28 and last night the whole thing just fell apart ! Amazon return cut off Nov. 2 . I emailed the company to ask about replacement . Not very happy at this point .
 The advertisement makes a person think that it will fit any bathtub faucet . It does not fit the typical square faucet . I ordered the sprayer and paid premium shipping to get it here after my wife broke her leg . After trying the adapter , it would not work . I had to find a different product to be able to help her bath.Jerry
 I just bought this today at the hardware store . It has a round faucet adapter and not a square one . Most bathroom tub faucets are square . My bathtub faucet is square . Like the reviews for the Alson pet shower , this one , too , does not go onto a square bathtub faucet , because it has a round adapter.It 's a nice-looking hand-held shower and I was really looking forward to using it . However , I will have to return it because , after struggling with it , I could not get it to fit onto my bathroom tub faucet .
 The picture of the product online is n't good enough to see that it does n't actually fit most tub spouts . To make matters worse , read the fine print - most sellers wo n't accept returns of this item for `` hygiene reasons '' - even if you did n't open the package . If you do get them to accept a return , you 'll pay the return postage and a restocking fee . I wo n't make a mistake like this again - hope you do n't have to .
 I DONT BELIEVE THERE COUND BE A WORST PIECE OF JUNK , TRIED ALL DIFFERENT SIZES STATED ON AD , LEAKED LIKE CRAZY ON ALL . RIGHT IN GARBAGECAUSE IT WOULD COST YO MUCH TO SEND IT BACK .
 I was excited about the idea and the price of this product but it does n't fit and returning it would be too much of a hassle and too expensive .
 I was considering this item and really was happy to have found it . I read the reviews from other users and I am glad I did . My tub has a rectangular nozzle ! So I am not going to order.See , people CAN make a difference !
 we bought this for our two large dogs to try in their water bowls before i brought our newborn home , and then once she was here to try to relax them a bit . we tried several different doses and did not notice any difference . i 'm sure it 's a good product , but for our purpose , we were not satisfied .
 I should have paid attention to the other reviews before purchasing . Would not buy again . I tried it on a rescue dog who was very scared - I saw no difference in my dog after using this product .
 Nothing but whiskey . Could buy a fifth for the same money . People used to put a drop of whiskey on a childs toung to calm them down or for teathing . Cheeper to buy a pint of `` Southern Comfort '' .
 Waste of money - I do not endorse the use of this product , I do not believe it works as it claims - on people or pets .
 I purchased this for my cat when he suffered a traumatic leg injury and had to be taken to a specialty Vet 30 minutes away once a week or more for over a month . I also read about this product inThe Natural Cat
 LOL . . I got all amped up . . bought them . Came in the mail . Took them for 2 days -LRB- withought taking the stimulants . . -RRB- I stopped taking them before day 3 . . I just started feeling like crap . . After I stopped taking them , I actually lost 12 LBS in 2 weeks just by portion control and a good diet . And working out ofcourse . . I would say normal people would n't need to bother taking this . probably just body builders trying to cut down before shows . . Regular healthy people should just eat a balanced diet and they would most likely see the results they want .
 I read a LOT of positive reviews of this product and was excited to try it . They advertise ridding the body of excess water , improved energy , appetite suppression , etc. . For me , non of this occurred.Hunger suppression - No . I still had the same appetite.More Energy - No . I do n't drink any caffeine or take other supplements during this trial , so i SHOULD have felt something , but I did not.Physical changes in body composition - No , not a thing.In the end , I felt like I had just spent money to swallow roughly 20 pills a day . Also these pills smell bad as well.Don ' t waste your time or money . Find a different product .
 I ordered these from a different site years ago -LRB- 2008 -RRB- . Since I have issues with spontaneous anxiety , I wanted to avoid taking the noortropic pill . I called the company -LRB- Universal -RRB- and they refused to tell me which pill was the noortropic pill so I could avoid it . They said that since their formula is proprietary , they ca n't tell which pill is which except for the caffeine . I tried one pack but the not-knowing bugged -LRB- and frankly scared -RRB- me to the point where I sent it back . If you have the ingredients listed on the can -LRB- which they do -RRB- I do n't see what the secret is in telling paying customers which pill performs which function . For that reason , I will not ever buy another product from this company .
 Works for a couple days ... pretty much get the exxcess water out of your body ... after that not much . You do have a little extra energy ... but when you eat anything with surgar ... it appears your body wants more then normal ... Animal Cuts 42 pckt
 Who are we kidding ? Its not the real deal . Youd might as well drink 2 cups of coffee before you hit the gym
 is a really soft product and is not really working if you drink coffee regulary.thermolean whit effedra or thermogenessis is better because you dont still hungry and you have more energie . with animal cuts you take 18 pills a days !!!! whit other product , one by day is enough for me . sorry if i dont speak english very well .

 Too many pills ! The individual baggies were nice but it was just too much and I never really saw any improvement . Stay away .
 Its pretty decent product . i took it faithfully ill admit some days i worked harder then other days . but im not sure i had rollercoaster results . some days i tried taking out the blue pills -LRB- Diuretic complex -RRB- and i wouldnt see any results . you know ? so not sure if its just a fancy water pill . because they couple pounds i did lose its stayed off so thats pretty good . but that i thought was kinda weird . the size and quantity is n't bad .
 I ordered this product with high hopes after reading many really good reviews ; however it literally made me sick to my stomach ! I took the product and 20 minutes later I was doubled over in pain . I tried taking it another time just to make sure and the same thing happened . I am someone who works out 5 days a week , eats a clean diet and drinks about a gallon of water a day . I guess I 'm one of the unlucky ones that can not tolerate it .
 First off , as always , everyone 's body is different . This is simply my experience so YMMV . I have taken many different Thermogenic/Fat Burning supplements throughout the past 7 years
 didnt do anything but make me have to go to the bathroom 3 times an hour . this stuff cant be healthy . .
 I bought this product last two weeks a goI useing by that time but It does n't make senseI recommend do not buy it .
 I 've used a number of Universal products in the past and been pretty happy with them , expecially Animal Pump . But Cuts did n't seem to do anything for me other than give me some energy from the caffine . I work out twice a day , cardio @ lunch and weights after work and I did n't see any change while taking these . My advice would be to save your money and spend it on creatine or whey protein .
 I should explain exactly how it went down : I am normally in shape but i usually have some off weeks and get lazy , workout every few days and eat crap food.I decided to workout and eat right , i started doing the insanity workouts -LRB- following the calendar -RRB- and within a week -LRB- yes , a single week -RRB- the fat in my stomach cut down enough for you to see my abs . -LRB- I still have that exact picture of just a single week of working out -RRB- So the next monday i began taking the CUTS product . I took it twice a day like it says and worked out following the insanity calander -LRB- and sometimes did bonus workouts -RRB- I continued to eat healthy , meaning no junk food , low sugar , high protein , etc.Three weeks later and i could almost swear it did nothing . Yes , i know my shoulders and chest look nicer , maybe my abs are slightly more noticeable . But i KNOW that i would have achieved this without CUTS.How do I know ? Read my post from the beginning again and it will be clear.I honestly feel like I was ripped off . Luckily Universal has a money back guarantee.I have been taking Animal pak and Animal flex.Out of the 3 products i 've been using , i think flex had a more noticeably -LRB- positive -RRB- effect . My joints do n't hurt as much , but i do notice that my lower back is less flexible . Perhaps not enough yoga is the problem.Animal pak doesnt give me energy throughout the day and i would feel either tired , lazy , or depressed ... BUT i do notice that DURING my workouts , i seem to be able to push harder . So thats good.Well , back to the CUTS review , i would n't say avoid it , but it honestly didnt do much for me . The ingredients in the capsules MUST be good for something , right ?
 I 'm been a weightlifter for most of my life on and off ; this product was very disappointing especially with all the hype surrounding it benefits . The no gain , mean I 've seen no benefit from using this product and not weight gain .
 I used half the can and only saw any difference the first few times I took it.Also , there are way too many pills in each pack . Kind of concerned me a bit .
 does n't work , waste of money , go for OxyElite Pro instead , it 's amazing . You will get everything that you want , but animal cuts does n't do anything
 Made my testicles hurt after u packages . May hve been just me , but i stopped taking them after day 2
 I wanted to try this product due to the great reviews from Amazon and -LSB- ... -RSB- . I was n't prepared for all the pills -LRB- like 18/day -RRB- . But not a problem . I rec 'd the product quickly and it was in good shape.It 's been about 5 days now and I can no longer take it . The directions say to take one packet upon waking and another one later in the day . If I take the pills on an empty stomach , my stomach feels as if its on FIRE . My usual routine is to wake up , take my supplements , work out , then grab a bite to eat . So unfortunately , this product is not for me .
 Let me preface this by saying I am a big Animal products fan so needless to say I was incredibly disappointed at the quality or lack thereof of this product . Let me also say that this was just my personal experience with this product and yours may differ.I have been utilizing this product for 2 weeks now -LRB- bear in mind it 's only a 3 week cycle at 2 packages a day -RRB- and I have noticed absolutely ZERO benefits from taking it . There is no increased energy , no increased strength , and let me be on record as saying there is n't even a placebo affect from taking this supplement . The only thing it does do is give me severe heartburn.To the company 's credit they do offer a money back guarantee but like anything in life I think it 's wrong to consume 2/3 's of a product and then demand a refund . I will take this as lesson learned and stick with the Animal products that I KNOW work -LRB- i.e. Animal Pack -RRB- .
 Aug. 28 , 2012I 've taken Universal Products before -LRB- Animal Rage -RRB- but so far Animal CUTS is just not doing anything for me . I do n't really feel any energy throughout the day or while I 'm working out . I take it first thing in the morning on an empty stomach and it does n't seem to have any effect on me . I do however feel heartburn . I 've heard people say they start sweating like crazy and I 'm not getting that either . I 'm drinking lots of water.I 'm 1-1/2 weeks into it . I 'll update later see if something changes but as of right now I would NOT buy this product again . -LRB- update -RRB- 12-07-2012I did n't get to finish the product . Tried to return it but Amazon does not refund supplements yet Universal has a complete money back guarantee . Oh well.I would not recommend this product . I do like other Universal Product but would pass on this one .
 I run , bike , or lift every day , one to two hours . I took this per the directions and did not change anything else , not diet or workout . Nothing else changed either ! The first few days , I had trouble sleeping , I drank a lot more water and peed a lot more , but do n't know if this was from the Cuts or not since I was drinking more water . Over the next 3 weeks , I did n't notice any change in my body fat at all . It did n't seem to affect my workouts in any way.For me , I wo n't buy this again . It did not help me lose any fat . Too expensive to show no results .
 Animal Cuts does not live up to it 's description . I never even felt it kick in . I looked puffier than usual . Felt groggy because the stimulating effects were insignificant . It does not decrease your appetite . It 's a dud . I usually do n't recommend another competitors product in a review because it will be perceived as if a the competitor is posting a fake review just to drum up sales - with that said , I am not in any way affiliated with USP Labs , but I highly recommend OxyElite Pro . It works , hands down . You will feel the energy , it kills your appetite , and you will see a difference on the scale and in the mirror . I 'm not sure why I switched to Animal Cuts perhaps I got caught up by the hype - but it was an expensive mistake that I will never make again . Sorry if this review seems like a sales pitch for OXY , but it 's not - I just swear by it .
 I guess you get what you pay for . It fits a gallon jug , and it usually pumps -LRB- usually -RRB- , but the pumping mechanism is separate from the fixed part ... as in it is free-floating , and it can fall out . The liquid in the container can spill out . Overall , this is not a `` good '' product , only a `` functional '' one ... and even that rating is marginal . If I were to buy another pump -LRB- and I will have to soon , I 'm sure -RRB- , I would not even consider these . I do not recommend that anyone waste their money on these pumps .
 The sweeping part of this Bissell works just fine but as many other reviewers have noted , the handle falls apart if you breathe on it wrong . My husband actually screwed the sections of the handle itself together but now it separates at the point where the handle meets the sweeper . And do n't bother reading the directions about how to put this together . The handle problem persists no matter what you do.I 'd recommend getting down to your local chain store -LRB- as much as I dislike recommending any of them for anything -RRB- and get a carpet sweeper with a handle that 's in one piece . This one is not worth the hassle .
 The other reviews convinced me this product was what I was looking for - quick and easy cleanups in between major vacuuming . I unpacked it as soon as I got it and tried it out on the cracker crumbs on our hardwood floor left from lunch . What it would pick up was only the smallest of crumbs , and even some of those it just brushed around on the floor . I decided to return it immediately . Problem now is getting the handle unassembled to repack .
 This thing basically self destructed the first week . The handle pieces would n't stay together and when I pushed down on the handle to tighten the pieces together the base fell apart . Not worth the money ! I was very disappointed .
 I ordered this sweeper to pick up after my granddaughters withouthaving to take out the vacuum.What a mistake!This is so poorly made . The problem is that the handle does not stay on.When you push it the handle comes off in your hand . I tried everything to fix it with no luck.Would not recommend this .
 The handel falls apart - kinda picks up dirt - i would not purchase this again Bissell 2402B Sturdy Sweep Sweeper
 This is junk ! I used to own a real Bissell carpet sweeper ... 1970 's ... If I had found this at a garage sale I would have thought it was a child 's toy
 I was not pleased with this product . The sweeping area is too small . The rubber hose detached . I would not reccommend this product .
 I had done quite a bit of research on carpet sweepers ... I thought I had looked at some ok reviews on this sweeper . it is awful . it is loud , moves things around on the floor , whether it is carpet or tile . Did n't work worth a lick . I ca n't tell you how disappointed I am in bissell . Please do n't waster your money . If you can go to a garage sale or a thrift store , get one of the old ones that just pick up everything , you only have to go over an area once and you do n't have to pick the stuff up yourself.this sweeper has two rows of brushes and rubber at each corner . it did n't pick up anything and the noise it made was as loud as a small vacuum ... horrible , DO NOT BUY IT .
 I loved `` helping '' my grandma clean when I was little . My mom had one of these for years . I was looking forward to buying this and giving the same memories to my kid . Too bad every time my kid picks it up , he cries because he thinks he broke it . I 'd rather try and dig out my grandma 's old one , it 's designed so much better and is more reliable than this one . It 's not priced cheap but it 's definitely built that way ! The handle comes in 4 pieces . You push the pieces together and smack it against the floor and it 's supposed to stick . It just falls apart ! My husband took it out to the cement stairs and hit the handle pieces together himself and it still comes apart . I 'm going to J.B. Weld the thing because I 'm tired of picking up the sweeper and reassembling it each time before I have to use it . It 's not a ` quick ' clean if you have to rebuild your cleaning tool each time!Then , when I try to bend it -LRB- for sweeping under the coffee table , etc. -RRB- I have to put my foot on the base and push the handle down , because it does n't swing easily on its own . It also still only works for heavy carpet areas . If you have thin carpets , linoleum or hard wood floors , do n't buy this . Go for the natural sweeper , it has bigger brushes and will actually pick up a few of the kitchen crumbs and dirt.I contacted Bissell and asked for a single piece handle and to see if they would at least put the little ball bearings and cut out holes on the handle , so it would snap together and lock in place . Instead of answering my question or even better , sending a solid handle , they sent me a form letter to the effect of `` we 're sorry your sweeper has malfunctioned '' and shipped out a natural sweeper . The handle still sucks , there was no response on how or if they are going to fix it , and I 'm stuck with gluing together another product because of shoddy design factors . Fun .
 I 've had carpet sweepers before and was looking forward to getting a Bissell which I 'd heard was the best around . Big disappointment . sorry but this one 's cheaply made and does n't do as good a job as the $ 20 no-name product I had before . The dual bristles and side bristles add nothing . The 3-part push-together handle keeps falling apart even tho I re-installed it according to the directions 3 times . `` Sturdy '' it is not . I do NOT recommend this product .
 I bought this sweeper in the hopes that it would do a decent job of picking up the cat hair in my kitchen , but it hardly picked up anything . Very dissappointing .
 This sweeper is more like a child 's toy than an adult 's tool . It works only when pushed in the forward direction and barely does the job for small quick pick-ups . -LRB- If you pull it toward yourself , it just jumps all over the place and spills what little it has picked up . -RRB- My husband dislikes it even more than I do . Would not recommend unless purchased for a child .
 I am very disappointed with THE BISSELL STURDY SWEEP SWEEPER . It does not perform well , at all . I can sweep over a small bit of paper 15-20 times before I actually need to bend down and pick it up by hand . It pushes dirt around the floor before sweeping it up . It 's a total waste of time on carpets and does absolutely nothing ! I went with Bissell because of its good name . I expected a reliable product that I could depend on . This is not it ! I am not at all happy with this purchase !
 I wanted a quick way to freshen the white carpeting -LRB- came with the house -RRB- without dragging out the big vacuum . I remembered using a Hokie way back when I was a chambermaid . But this ai n't it.It worked acceptably on bare floors but no great performance . One the rug , it pushed the dog hair so it would pile it . It would have been funny looking if I had n't waited so long to get the sweeper and then , had to send it back .
 it fell apart the first time we used it . the handle didnt stay attached to the bottom part of the unit .
 Handle keeps coming apart when you try to use this sweeper . Very annoying to use because of that . Does not clean that great either .
 I bought that sweeper a month ago , and I can say that it was a very bad purchase . I have a wood floor and the sweeper makes a lot of noise , it is impossible to clean in the edges or corners and its head does n't turn . I do not recomend ti buy this product , in addition the stick has three parts which separate constantly
 Very disappointed ... brushes very weak matted together after 1st use ... wont pick small things up off hardwood or rugs ... do n't waste your money !
 this handle does not stay on and takes a lot of elbow grease . I was dissappointed .
 it works good on carpet and it is definatly only for in between vacuming . save your money and go with the swivel sweeper ; its cheaper and runs on a motor and works soooo much better .
 The picture made me think the cleaner would turn like the swivel sweeper but it does n't . If you try , it will break . Bah !
 I really wish this sweeper worked properly but it just does n't . All the reviews about the stick falling apart are true . I do not see how it is possible to enjoy using this sweeper when the stick always coming apart . You have connect about 4 pieces of metal to create the metal pole which connects the little sweeper to the handle but within a minute of normal use it falls apart and does not stay together.For the few seconds it did stay together it did clean my rug pretty well however it is completely useless for ceramic tiles . I did n't try it on hard wood floors however based on the terrible performance on ceramic tiles I bet it would be useless on hard wood floors .
 This does clean up hair , dirt etc on the carpet really well.On the third use the handle kept coming apart.Have put it together with electrical tape , but the bottom still comes out ... Totally annoying . Bissel really could fix this problem quite easily and should .
 I wanted tis sweeper mostly for my kitchen floor . Turned out to not pick up well on bare floors . It is good on carpets though . Try a more expensive one , I would say , if your need is as mine
 This sweeper works better on the carpet than regular floors.I used it in the kitchen , but it really does n't work.It is really noisy when you moving itThen one I saw half piece of peanut on the floor , i sweep it , it does n't work.and you have to touch the bottom of sweeper to open the dust tray.So i suggest use these money to buy a good normal sweeper .
 Easy enough to use , but after a week I still was n't sleeping -LRB- this process takes several weeks -RRB- I just wanted to get to sleep like a normal person , and this was not helping . I ended up getting the nightwave sleep assistant and it worked in 3 days . It 's also cheaper . One thing that I wanted to mention is that when I bought this , I read all of the reviews -LRB- there were only 4 , I think -RRB- and they were all glowing reviews . After I got this and felt that it was n't so great , I checked the reviews again , and the people 's other reviews , I realized that they only wrote reviews for lifekey products , so they obviously were not impartial . I learned my lesson and now I always check the person 's other reviews ! Everyone probably knows that , but this is my first purchase here . Oh well ... you win some you lose some ...
 Most uncomfortable , digs in , falls down , does not hold them up , would not recommend them to anyone , useless and overpriced , would like my money back
 These are horrible and a complete waste of money ! As soon as I put them on they slid down . There is nothing to keep them up on their own . Do n't buy these unless you plan on getting a garter with them -LRB- yuck ! -RRB- I bought the ones with the silicone top and they work a bit better - still not great but better .
 I love Little Sprouts products but I hate this cream . It is thick which I love , but the smell is very overwhelming . It really stinks . If you like strong perfumed scents for your little one then this is the product for you ! However , not all Little Sprouts products have a scent like this one . So do n't judge all of Little Sprouts products by this one .
 This baby lotion is too thick and absolutely does not smell fresh or clean . Smells like something you would find at a parfume counter in a department store . Definitely not for my baby !
 This is a low duty brace . The brace I was sent did n't have any spring steel stays in it . It did n't feel like it offered much more support than a neoprene only brace would offer .
 Bought this brace for my husband because the one the doctor gave him was wearing out . When the brace arrived , there is an insert stating that the brace can not be worn more than 1-2 hours due to the type of material . My husband needs support all day at work . We returned the brace but the seller would not refund shipping and we had to payt he return shipment as well . Bought one at Walmart instead that is working great and cost less . Next time we will just go to the store !
 I ordered this first in XL , the size that should fit me according to McDavid . It was too small for me to pull it up over my knee . So I ordered it in XXL , the next larger size . This one is sloppy loose , and has to be bunched up under the straps in order to stay on at all . So what is a customer to do ? Two return charges now , and no size that actually fits . This is a brand name that I will avoid .
 I try and try to use this , but the handle keeps coming apart . I will have to glue it in order to use it .
 I unpackaged it all put it together -LRB- really easy -RRB- , . . threw out the box and waited to use it . When I finally used it it barely picked up anything . I really had to keep going over the same crumbs and dust bunnies to get it to sweep it . I think that the bristles do n't reach the floor enough to do the job . I was really disappointed in this product but for what it would cost to return it it was n't worth it . I also might add that if you have a really thick carpet it might work better for you , I was looking primarily for a bare tile , floor item that would pick up crumbs etc. . However a sweeper is a sweeper and it should to the same job that a broom would do . My Grandmother had one many years ago and it was like magic ! This one is cheaply made also . Hope that this helps .
 I saw many good reviews from the other buyers before ordering it , but I was so disappointed . As I held it in my hand to try it for the first time , it was noisy and inflexible for operation -- it was just like a funny toy for kids . The performance was no better than a regular broom that can really clean every corner . I returned it the next day !
 I looked at the reviews for this sweeper and decided to get one . What a waste of money ! It wo n't pick up much , a hair here or there , maybe . The brush is VERY soft . It would work great if the brush was stiffer so that it could grab on to the stuff on the floor . Oh well , you get what you pay for . As for the others who like it ...
 I wish people that had problems with the handle would not have given the item so many stars . I admit I neglected to read the reviews ahead of time because I was in a hurry , but also because it 's a cheap , simple sweeper with 4 stars . How could I go wrong ? I agree that the sweeper part works well , but the handle is junk . Sure , you could tape it , but even at the price you should n't settle for something so poorly designed . If only all the parts of the handle screwed in , or locked , it would be fantastic . But they do n't . It fell apart on me 3 times in less than five minutes.I 'm returning it immediately .
 The Bissell Swift Sweep picks up fine but the handle is a piece of junk . The parts do no interlock and no how hard you bang it , it falls apart immediately . Compared to the Rubbermaid sweeper I had for 15 + years -LRB- which finally gave up the ghost -RRB- , it is a waste of money , with no hand grip to speak of.Bissell Swift Sweep Sweeper , 2201-2
 Do n't buy this . It does pick up bitsies well . But it has one limitation and one fatal flaw that landed it in the garbage . The limitation is that it is ineffective along edges . The fatal flaw is that the three-piece pole falls into three pieces as you use it , after just a few strokes . I spent more time picking up the pole pieces and reassembling than I spent cleaning . And taping it only works temporarily . Did n't the manufacturer test this at all ?!?!? To replace this darn thing , I bought the Dirt Devil SD20000RED Versa Power All-in-One Stick Vacuum Cleaner for $ 20 on Amazon . It is so much better for essentially the same money !
 I bought this carpet sweeper to leave in our travel trailer -LRB- aka caravan in British -RRB- , but I started using it at home because its so easy to whip out and clean up the rug in my living room even several times a day -LRB- Baby & 3 kids & dog & cat = dirty quickly -RRB- , or to whizz around the hardwoods under the highchair . My kids can use it and actually like to use it without the huffing and puffing that comes with a vacuum cleaning request . It does a great job of picking up Labrador hair , food particles and dust bunnies and I empty it each use . However , you knew that was coming right ? However , the actual product is frustrating ... the handle falls apart everytime -LRB- there are 4 sections that slot together -RRB- , and the handle bracket comes out of its hole everytime too . The fundamental design of this type of product has not changed in years but this model seems to be a poor design . The handle needs to be either one continuous piece or each section needs to screw to the next . And the bracket -LRB- goes over the top of the sweeper to which the handle attaches -RRB- needs to be more securely fastened to the body . As soon as I find a better replacement , it will relegated back to it 's original intention - occasional use in the travel trailer !
 Sweeper was easy to put together , no problem with handle falling apart . Light weight easy to push . It only picks up about half the stuff from my carpets . Brush is not very stiff . Will not pick up cat hair . I bought it just for this purpose , for quick cleaning between using the heavy vacuum cleaner . Maybe a higher price one would be better . Will not buy another one unless I can feel the weight for the brushes .
 The handle came apart and gouged our new wood floor . A couple of sheet metal screws permanently fixed the problem . Now , the rubber gasket surrounding the base keeps coming off . Spend a few more bucks and get a decent unit .
 Had to send it back.Maybe this works on hardwood floor , but on carpet it does not.The handle assembly is flimsy at best .
 This is a small carpet sweeper . I should have looked more closely at the dimensions . It works fine just takes forever to go over an area to clean ... back and forth over and over to get the job done . Assembly is easy , BUT , the handle sections do n't stay together and I had to tape them . Storage is interesting because the handle does n't `` lock '' in an upright position so when the closet door is opened out comes the handle . If there was a hole on the top of the handle it could be hung on a hook because it weighs next to nothing but then if the handle was n't taped together it would fall apart . Not a good value for the price .
 The handle pieces really could have been better made . Such as the way a certain floor duster handle has interlocking pieces at each end so that once the piece is in place , it is locked . My Bissell handle has not managed to stay together , even after striking against a hard surface as the instructions suggest . Disappointed .
 Ads for this sweeper are very misleading . I 've used it 3 times and each time it has only picked up some dog hair and nothing else . It will never pick up
 It did n't seem to be picking up anything on the tile floor , so I swept and then tried using it to pick up what I had swept - it took SEVERAL Minutes just to get most of what I had already swept to get picked up . Then I went to empty it , and the handle came off and most of what it had finally picked up got dumped back all over the floor , to be swept up again.It is worse on carpet ; hard to get it to pick up anything at all .
 All the caveats written by other reviewers are true . I had to use duct tape to hold the pieces of the handle together ... and then the two prong piece connecting the pole to the sweeper itself broke ! In other words , this is a perfect piece of junk . I 'm still looking for something reasonably sturdy to sweep my carpet effectively when I 'm not using the vacuum cleaner -LRB- which I do twice a week anyway -RRB- .
 You have to put the handle of the sweeper together as part of assembling the sweeper . However , there is nothing to hold the pieces of the handle together ... so it falls apart frequently ! I read a review about the defective handle before I bought the product . I thought that it might be a `` one time '' thing with the reviewer that mentioned it . Well , low and behold , it happened to me as well . Its difficult to use when the handle falls apart all the time . And I even tried to duct tape it ! It did n't help .
 First of all , I have been a big fan of these sweepers since I was a little kid . I love quiet tools that get the job done . This one is not a quality , built to last one from the past by any means . Yes , most of us idiots -LRB- using some other reviewers words -RRB- can figure out how to tape the handle together because yes , it does fall apart . If you 're lucky , it wo n't hit you in the shin the first time you put it together and try it out . Just be careful when you lift it to empty the catch bins , it could bruise half your leg and ankle as it did for me . But in spite of this , it is n't JUST the awful handle pieces that fall apart , the rubber around the base and the entire handle pull away from the side of the base while you 're using it . It makes quite a mess as it falls apart and opens on your rug . I for one and sick of worrying if I am going to have a bigger mess to clean up , or have to put it back together every time I use it . I 'll be looking for something else . Maybe I got a dud but I ca n't believe that such a simple , time-tested product would be so poorly made . If I could find a vintage one that was clean , I 'd buy that instead . At least the price was cheap . JMHO
 The sweeper is indeed easy to assemble , but as other reviewers point out , the handle must be taped securely.I was never able to do that and finally gave the sweeper away . It is worth just what you pay for it .
 The metal pole holder literally snapped off . It 's beyond repair . Used it 3 times . I was pretty disappointed . IT also picked up close to nothing .
 I purchased this because it had good reviews and it was a Bissell product . This was primarily for my office , which has some low-pile carpeting , and it barely gets anything done . This may work well for a home or ` normal ' house carpeting , but is pretty bad for low-pile -LRB- most office spaces -RRB- .
 I had to use duct tape to keep the handles from falling off . It 's annoying how ghetto is looks with the tape , but it stays in the closet . Sweeps ok , but I use the Swiffer for finer stuff .
 The handle will not stay together . I have `` hit '' it so many times trying to get the pieces to stay together . It lasts for about two minutes then the handle comes apart while I 'm sweeping my kitchen floor . It picks up most stuff but not all . If the handle would stay together long enough to do my kitchen and foyer , I 'd give it three stars ... But having the handle come apart repeatedly
 The telescopic method used to assemble the handle pieces must have been designed by someone who really really hates Bissell . Hard as one tries to securely insert one piece into the other , unpredictably but inevitably the two separate while sweeping . This renders this sweeper essentially useless , unless you crouch down to use the small rod without the extension.That 's too bad because it does a fairly decent job picking up crumbs and small particles . I use it on a Persian rug , on tile in the kitchen , and even does well with kitty litter on tile floor.A 4 or even 5 star product had they used a screw-in mechanism or a spring action secure lock to fasten the extension to the base rod . But they did n't . So it 's a sucky 2 stars for this one .
 Never received product because you delivered to wrong person and wrong address . Have previously advised you about this but have yet to have any response . Not good , Amazon .
 Got it out of the box , and swipt it across the floor and the brush fell out and it continues to fall out . I would not buy this product . Ca n't even use it in camper , more work then it is worth ...
 This did not pick up anything we needed it to , except cat hair . It did n't even push the stuff around , just ran over it .
 I have used sweepers like this in the past with decent results , but this unit does not seem to work as well as I had hoped . We purchased it in the hopes of using it in between vacuums . My daughter 's room always gets little bits of debris all over it , and I thought something like this would help her keep it clean without dragging the large vacuum all the way upstairs . Like other reviewers I had the issue of the handle falling apart occasionally , but the big issue is that when someone is carrying it around it seems to leave a trail of debris behind it , especially when it is bumped into something like a wall . It also seems to take forever to actually pick something up . Using it is an exercise in frustration because it seems like it would be quicker to just get down and pick it up by hand . Just when you think you got that piece you were going for it dumps it off again about 3 feet away , and you get to start all over again trying to pick it up . I still have n't found a perfect solution for cleaning my daughter 's floor , but I can tell you that this unit is not it . We have four cats and four birds so a lot of what we are picking up is fur and feathers , though my daughter 's room seems to always have bits of paper on the floor . It does not seem to pick up any of these up well .
 The handle is weak and keeps falling apart . It is simply poorly manufactured . spend more money and get something that works .
 This Bissell Swift Sweeper model 2201-2 was too small to be useful . It actually seemed to be a toy . Only good use would be for a kid to help & follow Mom as she uses a full sized Bissell or a regular vacuum cleaner . I got stung with shipping costs to return it back to Amazon . Did n't make me happy since I bought two .
 I would have to review this sweeper very low . It does sweep well when it stays together but the handle keeps coming apart in 3 places . They should have made it one piece !
 Do n't waste your money on this product . I could n't agree more with one review I read that the handle always separates and now the base came off the handle . It does sweep well but the handle or something else always breaks everytime you use it . It is just not a well made product and in my case , it scratched my floor .
 We were happy with this product while it worked . It was inexpensive , picked up food our toddlers dropped on the carpet quite well , and was quiet and convenient to use . However , the fact that it broke after 3 months does n't make it seem worth it . We are now considering getting a quiet vacuum cleaner or higher quality carpet sweeper instead .
 It breaks all the time!la escobilla de en medio se cae cada vez que lo uso desde el primer d&iacute;a !
 This item does not work very well and falls apart easily . Poorly made and not reliable . I truly felt like this was a waste of money .
 I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS SWEEPER . THE HANDLE WOULD NOT STAY IN PLACE . EVERYTIME I USED IT , THE HANDLE WOULD FALL APART . I WASTED MY MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT . I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM AT ALL .
 I bought this to use in my cubicle so I did n't have to be annoying and use an electric vacuum . The rug is very flat and not shaggy at all , & I think I 'd be better off with a broom and dustpan to pick up anything on it than this sweeper . You have to really push the thing and go over things many times in order for anything to get picked up - even something as simple as a bit of paper from a spiral-bound notebook 's torn edge . Also , the design placing the roller brush in the very center of the head is unfortunate and makes it so that you ca n't get it to do anything near walls/edges unless you can move the sweeper with its sides up against them -LRB- I would expect the roller to be in the frontal part , not the center -RRB- . Anyway - does n't work for me . I 'll probably toss it .
 As I put this sweeper back into the packaging to return to Amazon , I could not help but think how much we have surrendered our country and quality to China . To save a few bucks here and there , we 've settled for stuff that would have been laughed at a few decades ago . Bissell used to be a quality product , but now it 's just another piece of light gauge , does n't - fit , falls-apart , never-works manufactured crap from the Chinese . The handle kept falling apart at mid-section ... funny part was I could not get the other part to come undone to fit into the package for return . If only the rest of the item was as well-built . I guess I will keep looking for a decent sweeper at garage sales and estate sales , hoping to find something made in the 60 's .
 I purchased this after reviewing the reviews . I was hoping that it worked ; as the reviews were mixed . I bought for the hardwood floor and it is completely worthless . It picks up nothing . If you use on carpets/rugs , it works OK but for hardwood/tile-save your money . Very disappointed .
 I bought this for quick clean up on my living room wool rug . The bristles were flimsy and bent over easily . It did n't pick up cat or dog fur from the rug . Further it did n't work well on the tile floor . I returned the product , the return process was super easy and amazon was awesome about it .
 What 's a sweeper without a reliable handle ? Handle was installed according to instructions , fell apart and repaired multiple times . This product defect has persisted for too long . Until it is corrected , this sweeper will be of little use .
 Can this sweeper replace my broom ? I 'm sorry to say , but NO . It was the reason I bought it in the first place , to replace my broom and use in between vacuuming.things it ca n't do : does not get into cornersdoes not get right next to the wallnot as quiet as my broom . -LRB- loud and squeaky enough to wake up my baby -RRB- not as thorough as a broom.so after I 'm done with this thing ... I still need to go over again with a broom!things it 's good for : spills in the middle of a room that has low pile carpet , such as berber . That 's the only thing my broom ca n't do well , but that 's what a vacuum is for .
 The handle broke about ten minutes after opening it . I read the instructions and used the hammer for the assembly . The handle snapped in two . It was made out of cheap metal . The sweeper head worked well from what I saw with limited use . It was light weight and looked nice . After the handle broke Amazon took it back and I purchased another kind of sweeper . Too bad this one was n't very durable !
 I bought this because the reviews seem to be pretty good . The handle comes in 3 pieces and they do n't interlock or anything , so I had to use tape to keep them together . A few weeks later , this rubber belt came off . I 'm not sure why it 's there in the first place because the sweeper can still sweep . It works , but it 's ugly . I 'm not sure what else will come off next . I would not recommend this product .
 Every piece you put together comes apart and you have to glue it or smash it cuz it gets you so frustarated . The rod between your hand and the sweeper is a two part thing you put together but comes apart every time you use it . The rubber bumper around sweeper comes off every time so I do n't even use that any more . the Top handle comes off . Ca n't Amazon sell something made well form Iowa or Ohio like the old ones ? They were a dream to use ten or more years ago !
 This carpet sweeper could n't pick up cat hair from the carpet -LRB- which was my primary goal -RRB- . It caught some , but the rest it just pushed around . Not acceptable .
 The manufacturer 's description is misleading . It sounds like it 's an all-around basic sweeper , but it does not work on hard-wood floors . Sure , for carpets , it 's quite helpful , but that 's not why I bought it . We have the pricey vacuum for our one and only oriental carpet -LRB- I have allergies -RRB- . I wanted something to pick up all the debris my kids bring in on our hardwood floors , which cover the remainder of our house . The sweeper picks up nothing . Literally , you can run it over the same spot 5 times , but you 'll be very lucky if it picks up anything . It 's really meant for carpets -- the rollers inside use the friction with the carpet fibers to pick up debris . Without that friction , nothing happens.Yes , the handle does n't work on mine either , but that did n't concern me
 Works for quick jobs on carpet , but was disappointing to find out that it absolutely does not work on hard floors . On hard floors it simply pushes dirt / garbage around .
 UPDATE
 This sweeper is basically worthless . The brush that is supposed to pick up items is too far away from the sides of the dustbin , so that you must bend over and use your hands to move debris away from walls and furniture for the sweeper to catch it . Same goes for debris in the grout grooves ... the brush does n't reach 1/8 of an inch below the level of our tile . As long as I 'm bent over to move the debris to a position that this sweeper can catch , I might just as well pick it up myself.As noted by other reviewers , the handle falls apart frequently , even though we followed instructions for assembly , and `` banged '' it as recommended by other reviewers . The only good thing is that the dustbin opens easily for emptying what little debris is collected .
 They did n't even give you any tape to tape it together . Handle is in 4 pieces , no threads , so everytime you use it the handle falls apart . It is like something for a little girls playhouse . : - -LRB- Bill in Las Vegas
 Breeze to put together , getting it to stay together is a different story . Yes , the handle does break apart ! The size of the sweeper itself is that of a childs toy and picks up just as well , if not worse . For the price , I wish I had bought the less expensive Bissel at Walmart . Oh , and the mess I had with shipping was awful ! Please , do n't waste your money on this item .
 Burt 's Bees is almost guaranteed to be one of those brands that will forever draw in a certain core crowd of admirers . Despite the fact that no matter what it is we are talking about that 's made by them , it is destined to be horrendously overpriced . I do believe that much of that fact is due not to Burt 's Bees presumed superior quality , but more to its company 's excellently thought out distribution system . Here in New England , the only places that you see a Burt 's Bees display is in those wonderfully quaint , but usually way too-rich-for-my-blood country type stores we all know and love . The type of places that sell boxed soup mixes and granulated spices for about 7 times the price you could find its equivalent in any supermarket . One thing I will say for Burt 's Bees products , they do smell nice , and they do n't appear to spare anything on the oils they use to achieve its scent . Unfortunately when you are talking about a brand that sells even their lip balm for $ 4.00 , in my opinion they are asking me to pay just a little too much for their perceived consummate quality . Burt 's Bees shaving soap is just another example of their expert marketing strategy , as well as unfortunately also one of their best examples of giving the everyday man who just wants a good quality shaving soap the corporate shaft . I bought a cake of the Burt 's Bees soap at a local store here because I still use a mug and brush to shave , and enjoy trying new shaving soaps . It smelled nice and lathered quite well . However take it from someone that has used dozens of different soaps over the years , the Burt 's Bees was not in any way superior in either scent or lather . In fact the whole shaving experience with it was just barely average in my opinion . For what you get , and what they 're asking for it , it should not even be a consideration for purchasing . As far as I am concerned , its price is nothing less than a modern day version of highway robbery . If you are still a man that shaves with a mug and brush , you would be far better served by shopping on Ebay for your mug soap . Type in `` shaving soap '' on Ebay and you will find hundreds of auctions available where just about any scent imaginable can be found by dozens and dozens of people that make excellent soaps in their own homes . For what you pay here for one cake of Burt 's Bees , you could easily get 3 bars of just about anything you desire on Ebay.In conclusion , if you are a die hard Burt 's Bees loyalist , buying your shaving soap on Amazon is just as good and cheap a place as any . However if you 're someone that enjoys a refreshing , rich lathering shaving soap in just about any scent you favor for a fraction of the price of the Burt 's Bees , I recommend you skip this horrendously overpriced brand and try my Ebay recommendation . Whether you desire or admire a bay rum scent or any other , your money will much better served away from this stuff . .
 I just searched the Burt 's Bees site and they are selling the soap for $ 6 . If that is all that you are offering then you are trying to really rip someone off !
 We use a ozone generator for our aquarium.After a few months -LRB- 4-5 -RRB- , this unit stopped working.I suppose it did as designed , but just not what we needed -LRB- daily -RRB- . Might have other useful applications ...
 The only thing I hate about this warmer that it 's tooooo small . however it warms wax pretty good .
 Amazon lists this as 300 tabs and when you select the item it is 120 . Otherwise I am sure the product itself is fine .
 It has been several weeks since I ordered a cane , and it NEVER has arrived . I am very disappointed in the customer service of this company . I have e-mailed the company several times , with no response . If I want to contact them by phone , it is long distance for me . I want a refund . Buyer beware if you choose to purchase something from this company . Again , very poor customer service .
 Did n't like this shampoo at all - it did n't make my hair silky or smooth , like the Mink shampoo when I was younger . In fact it made my hair sort of wavy , or more like bent in places . Awful . Silk shampoos are much better -LRB- and do n't require minks to be killed ! hope I do n't get any more presents along this line -RRB- . Try Sleektress by Nexxus instead .
 My whole cardiopulmonary unit tried this stethoscope and it was worse than the disposable ones we use for precaution rooms . We have a shortage of stethoscopes , so people barrow . I ca n't give this one away . My Littman Cardiology STC turned up and we are all happy again . I tried , I really wanted to believe something this cheap could do all everyone claimed .
 I ordered this stethoscope through Amazon and was very happy with it for two weeks . -LRB- I am a Respiratory Therapist -RRB- Then one day I placed the CLEAR RED HEART on a patient 's chest to listen to breath sounds and my eyes saw a terribly chipped and cracked RED HEART . I had no idea how it had been damaged . I contacted Amazon & sent it back and they had a brand new one back in my hands in less than a week . Three days later , I was cleaning it off with alcohol after a `` CODE-BLUE '' and the RED HEART chipped and cracked right infront of my eyes with red flakes popping off the surface of the HEART and several deep cracks penatrating half way through the entire heart . The plastic must not be tolerant to alcohol . I returned it to Amazon for a refund.Prestige Medical Clear Sound Heart Stethoscope , Black
 Very cute stethoscope , but not recommended for any clinician that is interested in auscultating without having to guess . It would be a great gag gift or even sufficient for pediatric patients . Not recommended for patients with various co-morbidities . I would n't spend more than $ 19.99 or less on this product .
 Very cute stethascope but if you 've ever used a Cardioscope Classic you will be disappointed . Ca n't hear heart and lung sounds clearly due to all the external noise .
 Regardless of it being cute and light , the ear buds crack easily , the head is a bit too big and the acoustics are def . not the best
 Awful stethoscope !! Acoustics are HORRIBLE !! The heart cracked on this stethoscope as soon as it was taken out of the package . Save your money for a better scope !!!
 Loved the look and sound of the stethoscope . But it cracked within my first 12 hour shift so sent it back for refund
 I bought this item for the looks . I work Med/Surg as an RN . Acoustics were moderate in rating , I have used better sounding stethoscopes . This item was not abused in any way , but cracked in 3 places on the head within days of purchase . Dissatisfied customer . I would recommend an Ultrascope -- Better acoustics , more expensive but better quality .
 It definitely is the cutest stethoscope out there but it is harder to hear sounds , hard to use because the head -LRB- heart -RRB- it is too big and because it is acrylic it cracked within a couple of weeks . I am buying a Littman now .
 Product arrived very quickly , but the head looked like it was scratched or cracked . The sound was very muffled as well . Not ideal for hospital floor work .
 Its styleish ... But the heart is wayyyy thicker then it looks and does not fit under blood pressure cuff ... Im so disappointed . Im saving up to buy a new one ... you can hear very well but i need it to fit its almost 2 inches thick -LRB- the heart -RRB-
 This stethoscope was just what I needed . I could hear manual BPs with ease and lung sounds clearly . Unlike other stethoscopes , it did not feel like it was placing a strain on my neck . Plus my patients always had a pleasant comment about it . Well less than 3 months after receiving it , I bent over to get my pen and it fell from around my neck . Well the heart cracked off and flew across the room . There was no repairing it . The metal portion -LRB- which I guess was aluminum -RRB- that was embedded in the heart made a clean break . I am saddened and disappointed in the quality . It was nice while it briefly lasted .
 I purchased this based on the reviews and was very disappointed . Sound quality was horrible . Maybe I received a defective item . I 'll be purchasing a Littman , hopefully those review are more accurate .
 FYI . . This scope is good for manual BP 's . It is a great conversation piece and patients love it.Acoustically I give it a low rating . It is very difficult to hear crackles on the resp assessment + difficult w cardiac.Not a good choice if you are an advanced clinician .
 The chest piece is massive and it does n't sit well on very many surfaces such as a slender arm . But what is worse is that the sensitivity is terrible compared to a standard stethoscope . Even with my good hearing , it was almost impossible to clearly hear a heartbeat . I was very disappointed with this product .
 They did n't send me the heart stethoscope but a normal looking one ! They got the color right , but i could gotten that from the next door store ! cheaters
 I loved the price of this stethoscope but soon realized why it was so cheap when the glass encasing the bell on it cracked within a couple of days . Definitely not a good deal . You are better off with the more expensive Littman .
 First of all this is great with patients . They just love the heart and color ! Other then that its very hard to hear anything . I was not able to hear a NG placement and boy , was I mad . I 'm a nursing student so the price was right at the time but its hard to hear any sounds , sometimes I can , sometimes I cant . Maybe I recieved a bad Prestige Stethoscope . Plus the shipping deal , the stethoscope , to my house took forever , I had to call and check the status of my order . It arrived but later then expected . Good luck !
 Please , please do not waste your money on this item . It is cute , but the heart is not made of shatter resistant resin like it claims and will crack . I purchased one and Iam an RN and do not recommend it . Buy a regular stethoscope with nothing fancy !
 After reading the reviews , I chose this scope . I was terribly disappointed ! I could not pick up anything ... just an extremely vague thump sound -- sometimes ! It was no better than a toy in my opinion . I have returned it and plan to buy another scope . How anyone can say they got great use out of this is beyond me !
 I bought this specifically for the lavender scent but this stuff smells horrible . What a disappointment . Other products that are unscented smell better than this .
 I have purchased this item twice now thinking the first time maybe the batch was old or something ... The price is great but the smell of this product is horrible . I will never buy this again ... if you can handle the smell the product does get rid of the hot-flashes .
 Received new in box . Gauge was out of calibration way off 0 rectangle . Had to send back same day .
 I had really high hopes for this product given the description and the reviews . Unfortunately , it did n't work for me -LRB- and I started with the smallest dosage -RRB- and ended up upsetting my stomach even more ! I stopped using it and the stomach troubles eased . May not be for everyone .
 I love love love Heathers peppermint capsules for my IBS . So i figured this is a fiber I can trust . WRONG ! I only did the 1 dose of half a teaspoon . I could n't even do the second one to get a full dose in for the day . I had cramping and nausea and felt ill so badly i could n't stand straight . I thought well maybe it 's just me . My fiance tried it who has no stomach issues and has no issue with fiber at all . In fact I swear his stomach is like a goat . He can endure anything well not this fiber . He took the same amount as me and had the same reaction . We both swore off this fiber and threw the whole can away . Waste of money for me and him . And he is the type that will eat something again that made him sick before . Sorry but I will never order this fiber again .
 I purchased this product mainly on reviews written by users of the product . I found that it did not improve my symptoms and in fact , they became worse .
 I have IBS-D for over 20 years . I have tried fibers . This too did not work . I gave it about a month .
 I tried the fiber for a couple of weeks , got up to one and a half teaspoonsand noticed a marked increase in bloating.I just do n't think more fiber is really what I need!Not sure where to go from here .
 I wish I had n't wasted my money on this product and purchased Miralax instead . It might work for you but it did not work for me .
 I think my symptoms may be more problematic than normal , as nothing seems to help . And I do n't know if this product would help or not because it 's such a pain to use that I have n't been able to stick with it.The big problem is how horribly it dissolves in liquid . It 's a big production of having to mix it just so - you have to , essentially , mix as you are pouring in the liquid , hot or cold , with a fork -LRB- a spoon does n't seem to work well -RRB- , otherwise it does n't really dissolve at all , just gums up . Even doing it as instructed it still does n't dissolve easily . It says to wait a few seconds , and then restir until all is dissolved.I found it takes a few stirrings over a few minutes to get it to dissolve even when done as instructed . Try to vary from the instructions and you 're likely to get gummy chunks that do n't dissolve at all.Most powders meant to dissolve in liquids are n't even close to being this finicky.I 'm guessing it would help to some degree , but it 's just too much of a hassle , and I never noticed any improvement even when I did use it .
 I suffer from IC and have a sensitive bowel and was told by a representative at ICN that this product is IC friendly . I tried Heather ` sTummy Fiber for 1 month and did not notice any improvement .
 I have IBS-C and this made the constipation worse . Unfortunately , I now have this huge amount of fiber that I ca n't use . Heather should provide a trial size .
 There were little bugs like old flour gets so I lost confidence and had to throw it away . I did open it upon receipt .
 I 'm sure its great for some people , but it made my stomach hurt . I gave it a week and introduced it slowly , but to no avail . An expensive experiment .
 I suffer from IBS with constipation and this made me very painfully gassy , bloated , and did not alleviate the constipation . I loved that it would -LRB- eventually -RRB- dissolve completely in liquid , but after a month of feeling miserable from it , had to give it up .
 Heather 's Tummy Fiber CAN ~ Organic Acacia 16 oz . CANISTERI have tried this product several times . I does n't seem to help regulate me and in fact several times after taking it I 've had several cramps and gas pains the following day . The peppermint tabs do n't seem to help much either . I do better with Metamucil .
 This stuff would n't dissolve - very lumpy . Did not help my IBS at all ; may have even worsened it . Never buying any of Heather 's products again . Very disappointing .
 I ORDERED THIS MIRROR BECAUSE IT HAD SUCH GOOD REVIEWS WELL MINE CAME YESTERDAY AND I DID NOT LIKE IT . THE MIRROR HAD THE SMALL MAGNIFICATION MIRROR ON IT BUT THIS SMALL MIRROR IS ON THE SIDE THAT IS THE NORMAL SIDE NOT THE BIG SIDE . WHEN I WENT TO USE THE NORMAL SIDE OF THE MIRROR TO PUT ON MAKEUP THIS SMALL MAGNIFICATION MIRROR WAS IN MY WAY IT ALMOST MADE ME DIZZY THE SMALL MIRROR IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOTTOM OF THE MIRROR AND LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD BE OUT OT THE WAY BUT IT WAS N'T . THEY SHOULD N'T HAVE PUT THIS SMALL MIRROR ON THE NORMAL SIDE I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT MIRROR IF THIS SMALL MAGNIFICATION MIRROR HAD BEEN ON THE SIDE WITH THE BIG MAGINGICATION MIRROR THEN YOU WOULD HAVE THE WHOLE SIDE FOR PUTTING ON MAKEUP AND THE OTHER SIDE WHEN YOU NEEDED IT FOR SOMETHING YOU REALY NEEDED TO DO UP CLOSE . I STARTED NOT TO WRITE THIS BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER REVIEWS WERE SO GOOD ON THIS MIRROR BUT I FELT LIKE PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW THAT THIS DOESNT WORK FOR EVERYONE . I SHOWED IT TO MY DAUGHTER AND DID N'T TELL HER THE WAY I FELT ABOUT IT AND SHE SAID THIS LITTLE MIRROR WOULD BE IN MY WAY AND WOULD DRIVE ME CRAZY . I AM GOING TO SEND THIS BACK AND ORDER ONE THAT HAS THE PLAIN MIRROR ON ONE SIDE AND THE MAGINGICATION MIRROR ON THE OTHER SIDE WITH NO SMALL MIRROR .
 I do n't like the way the light shows in the reflection when I look in the mirror . I would prefer a mirror without the light . The cord is an added mess to the countertop . Too late now .
 I used to have a Revlon mirror , which worked great . I bought this Conair mirror because it was more stylish -LRB- polished chrome compared to my plastic Revlon mirror -RRB- . Unfortunately even the brightest setting on this mirror is not as bright as I desire . Secondly , every time I bump the base , it turns the light off ! I wish that I would have stuck with my Revlon .
 I had been looking forward to this product until I plugged it in and turned it on . As I leaned forward to look in the mirror , I was so close I was almost touching it to see myself and that was distorted . When I leaned back a little , forget it , I could not discern my face at all . The light was very dim on the highest setting compared to my old makeup mirror . I irritably packed the mirror up and shipped it back for a refund.I do n't understand why someone ca n't make a pretty makeup mirror that does n't distort your face severely . It would also be nice to have a light setting that is more powerful and useful.My desk mirror I intended on replacing -LRB- a Clairol -RRB- , is 25 years old and have not had to replace the lights , yet . -LRB- knock on wood -RRB- I suppose as ugly and space consuming as it is , I should stick with what still works and forget esthetics .
 The product 's shipping cost was way too expensive . Almost 50 % the total cost of the product .
 I was a devout Mychelle buyer and loved their products . I bought and returned this item recently when I noticed most of the ingrediants had been changed to cheaper ones . I still have a jar of the original stuff and have searched the internet to find some of the original but cant . Here are some of the first ingrediants in the original one
 I have sensitive skin , but immediately upon applying this mask , my skin started to burn . Not tingle , burn . I may have had an allergic reaction , but I highly recommend that people start with a sample . Obviously , my skin reaction meant that I ca n't use the product , but even if that was n't a factor , the smell was putrid . It smells like decaying fruit . Quite nasty . Bottom line
 I have combination skin and usually have no problem with peels or enzyme masks of any kind . However , this broke me out terribly after using it . I tried it several times to see if my skin was just `` purging '' but my skin always had the same reaction . I am really sad because I had high hopes for this product line because it seemed to have great reviews , but I am continually unimpressed each time I try something by them . Perhaps it is because they have changed their formulas and are using cheaper ingredients ? I 'm not sure . All I know is this one does not work for me .
 I bought this item from all the 5-star reviews it received on Amazon . Unfortunately , I ca n't say the same as the other reviewers . This product did absolutely nothing for my skin ; no peeling , no glow , barely a tingle . I doubt I will purchase any of their other products and definitely would not recommend this product to anyone .
 I saw a youtube video about how great this product is but when I went online to search for more reviews I noticed that all reviews prior to 2010 are great and after 2010 were not good at all . I read that the company has changed over to inexpensive ingredients . I was really looking forward to using this product but after learning about the new ingredients and reading the reviews after 2010 I will continue my search for a natural peel product . Suggestions anyone ?
 How you do rate a product you have not used ? MY low star review is not due to my using the product - but rather the fact that the product has obviously changed formulation over time and all the newer reviews claim that the it is different than in the past - now using cheaper ingredients . The old posts give glowing praises - the newer ones NOT . So , I guess I will skip this product line and try something else .
 Ordered the cleaner with Teflon , which I could n't find in stores . Description said `` Teflon '' , pictured was a box that said `` Teflon '' , received a case of cleaner - no Teflon . Could have bought THAT at Wal-Mart . Thanks for wasting my time .
 We like this soap for our infant and toddler but I am not sold on the fact that it is gentaler on their skin than the regular babysoaps . Cute packageing for gifts though !
 After reading the good reviews for this product I decided to order it for my children . Last night when I first used it , both of them screamed when it got to their eyes !! It is not tearless at all ! Also , the scent is not good , smells of `` old lady '' soap . I hope at least it does n't dry up my little ones ' sensitive skin .
 Try something else unless you have children to wash with this soap . This stuff just really does n't get you clean . Period . My husband smells just as bad as he did before he got into the shower after using this stuff and has to do it all over again . If you have kids in sports , try Old Spice or Safeguard . This stuff just wo n't do the job .
 Microflex MF300XL Powder Free Diamond Grip Latex Gloves Size Extra ... Not something I will purchase again . Not something I will purchase again . Not something I will purchase again . Not something I will purchase again.Update
 While the product itself is sound , it 's much too bulky to fit into all my existing shoes . Basically , I 'll have to upgrade my entire shoe collection and get something wider or longer in order for these to fit .
 These inserts were too hard and made my feet hurt . May work for some , but did nothing for me .
 I really wanted to like these 3/4 orthodic inserts , I wanted pain relief from having flat feet , and based on the reviews , it seemed promising , however i should have read the negative reviews more closely . They are really bulky and while the arch seems sturdy , it is way too hard , and uncomfortable , after wearing it for one day , I wish I had not purchased them , my feet hurt more ! so i am back to the 3/4 dr sholls 6 dollar inserts I purchased at walmart . they relieve the pain a little , im still looking for a good pair of inserts .
 The things are ABSURDLY too wide - makes my shoes look like clown shoes - what a stupid product . It seems that the footbed was just modeled after a man 's foot . These things are sitting on the floor , totally useless . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY .
 I ORDERED FROM 2 DIFFERENT COMPANIES . THNAK GOODNESS I ONLY ORDERED 1 PAIR FROM THIS COMPANY . THEY SENT THE WRONG PRODUCT IN THE WRONG SIZE . I COMPLAINED TO AMAZON BUT HAVE N'T GOTTEN ANYWHERE . THE OTHER ONES WERE FINE . I 'M NOT A HAPPY CAMPER . PROBABLY WO N'T ORDER THROUGH AMAZON AGAIN . I DO N'T EVEN KNOW THE COMPANY AND THEY DID N'T SEND A RECEIPT OR PACKING SLIP OR ANY PAPERWORK IN THE3 PACKAGE .
 i am wearing US 7 shoes and i order the insole according to the shoes size , ie . women US7-8 . When i received the product , it is too wide and too long , i cant use it at all ... not sure if this is not suitable for asian lady 's feet ... ?
 this was a waste of money . too big . they may fit in a sneaker but still feels bulky . they did nothing for me .
 I 've been walking constantly @ 1.5 mph for 8-10 hours a day at a treadmill desk for the past week and my heels have been killing me as I have flat feet and have developed a lovely wicked case of plantar fasciitis.Thought these would be the ticket , and for the first couple hours I use them everyday , they are . A marked drop in discomfort levels ! However , after a couple of miles/hours , the heat generated by my feet seems to cause even these highly rated orthotics to fail . When I stop to check them , they are very warm to the touch and give and bend easily making them pretty much useless for the longer term arch support I need.Disappointed and needing a new fix , soon .
 I ordered a pair of these Spenco orthotic arch supports after reading all the great reviews.What a disappointment ! I do n't know if they 've changed the design recently , but the plastic arch support is so soft and flexible you can squash it flat with your hands . Of course , when you put your full body weight on it , it flattens out completely , meaning there 's virtually no arch support at all.If you have low arches or flat feet , my advice is to look elsewhere for an orthotic with more rigid arch support .
 I bought these to put in my work shoes -- plain black flats . The problem is , now with them inserted , the height of the orthotic makes my shoes not fit worth a flip . They wo n't even stay on my heel now because I ca n't put my foot deep enough in them . So , in short ? Useless .
 I ordered the 3/4 to try them , as I always use the full length . I did n't like the 3/4 length because if you put it in your shoe with the insole of the shoe left in it takes up too much room . If you take the insole out there is room in the shoe , but you do n't have any sole or cushion in the front of the shoe , and the transition from the orthotic to the sole of the shoe is uncomfortable . So I returned them and reordered the full length instead . Other than the length , they feel and do the job as the full length . Oh , by the way , I love that you can mold them to your specification .
 This is a terrible lightning rod . It seems to be constructed from some sort of insulating material , so it does n't conduct well . If you place it in an elevated position during during a thunderstorm and expect it to attract any stray lightning bolts you 're going to be disappointed . Also , it is shaped disturbingly like a phallus.On the plus side , it glows in the dark , which is pretty cool .
 I tried using Profibe for two weeks . I did n't think I would have an issue since I use Metamucil 2-3 times a day . Unfortunately while taking this product I was NOT able to be in public , if you know what I mean . Maybe they should change the name to Clear the Room !
 I had heard many good things about this product and thought that maybe it would be worth the $ $ $ 's . But after taking it one month , I have n't had much pain relief or improved stability . In fact , the arthritis in my knee flared up badly a week and a half ago . Could have been a seasonal thing . I continue to take Phosoplex and will do so for another month until my supply runs out . Then I 'll see if I 'll order it again . Regarding the stomach upset issue
 It does n't sag down on my calf , but it wo n't stay up on my thigh either so it ends up bunching up around my knee . Have n't really had it long enough to make too many other judgements but my first impression is about a 2 1/2 star impression . Take it or leave it . I 'm sure there are better products out there.I 've actually returned this item as the bunching up at the knee became more trouble than it was worth . Additionally , the mesh panel located behind the knee was uncomfortable and a huge irritation .
 I should have listened to the other reviewers . This was much too large and even if it was n't I doubt it would have stayed in place . I do n't even know where it is right now , a waste of money .
 I followed the measurements and it is too large . . I tried to wear it but it kept falling down and defeats the purpose of why I purchased it ... for support .
 I just received my order today and it was also only 1 bottle instead of the case of 12 32 oz . bottles which I had ordered . This is completely deceptive and dishonest ! The item description CLEARLY states a CASE of 12 32 oz . bottle -LRB- s -RRB- .
 I receiced 1 bottle not 12 bottles as the description states Reckitt All-Purpose Cleaner , Lemon , 12 32 Oz Spray Bottles/Carton . I paid 4 times what I would have paid at my local grocery store for the same product . This was misleading and deceptive . Texas has a Deceptive Trade Practices Act -LRB- DTPA -RRB- & this difinitely falls under that heading . Extremely disapointed in the description and receipt of this product .
 I purchased 2 boxes a couple years ago and they were great . Really tough . Zero gloves ripped under normal use , even after sitting in the box for a year . I would show them off to other people by sticking a slotted screwdriver in them and stretching out the glove which would not rip ! Amazing ! So I bought more . What a difference ! 10 % to 20 % of the new gloves tear either when putting them on -LRB- ! -RRB- or in light normal use . One box I have at hand right now is Lot # 52010690210-L1 . I often use toluene , industrial epoxies and other strong adhesives I really do n't want on my skin -LRB- these also require wearing a respirator -RRB- , so it matters to me that these fail so easily and so often . Maybe this is just a lapse in quality control ? Both boxes have 10-20 % failures . I am switching to another brand
 I took this kit on a seven day kayak trip . The contents were wet after the second day . The container was similar to a ziplock bag but it would n't stay closed - too small . Very disappointed . Just glad I did n't need any of the contents .
 I do n't care what you use it for . This is a bad product . First , the ear piece is very uncomfortable . In fact , it hurts my ear canal . And it does n't isolate sounds at all . The sound you receive using this is less than what you would get from having your ear next to someone 's chest wall.I do have a better quality stethoscope and wanted this one to play a back up stethoscope role when I do n't have the other one in handy . But it just is n't usable . It 's on par with kids ' toy stethoscope . Try using this to do BP and you will miss the beat most of the time , if you can hear it at all .

 This cane is OK . The handle chippped and looked old after about one week . The tip can not be replaced . If you try to do this the cane falls apart and can not be repaired . I would not recommed this cane to anyone .
 I purchased this for my husband who is allergic to penicillin , the most important part of the bracelet , which is to inform medical personnel about his allergy , was not attached properly . I wrote to the seller to inform them of this problem and was told to contact the manufacturer , I do not see why I should contact the manufacturer when I did no business with the manufacturer . This part of the bracelet has since fallen off and there is now no point in him wearing the bracelet . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY .
 I purchased these Microflex Supreno SE nitrile gloves since they were slightly cheaper than the Kimberly Clark version and seemed to be comparable in material and thickness . I just wear these gloves around the house for cleaning , home improvement projects and weeding outside , tasks that I consider somewhat standard and not extreme , by any means . These gloves get holes in the fingers easily and tear easily -LRB- the top of the finger will come off , for example -RRB- . I am almost through the whole box and the holes/tears are frequent . I often need to stop my task and replace a glove . If I were working on hazardous tasks , this could be a very serious issue , but it is still really unacceptable performance to me . I wear the Kimberly Clark purple nitrile exam gloves routinely at work -LRB- chemical/laboratory -RRB- and have also tried them for the same tasks mentioned above at home . The KC gloves have never failed me - no issues with holes , etc. . I have been dissatisfied with the Supreno SE nitrile performance and definitely will not repurchase - I will instead purchase the KC version , even if they cost slightly more.On a side note , I have also purchased the Microflex SafeGrip gloves -LRB- much thicker -RRB- and have not had any issues with those . They are much thicker and are designed to resist needle punctures .
 These do not work , sorry but the truth hurts ... they are basically a placebo . I would n't waste your money on it .
 This Aubrey product was a disappointment . Up to now all Aubrey products I 've tried have been very good , but the scent of this aftershave could hardly be described as ` spicy ' - more like rubbing alcohol . Not a pleasant scent .
 Description states that this is an invisible solid but is is not . It is a white , powder-based deodorant and it is most certainly visible upon first application . I made a poor choice to purchase this before reading all of the reviews . I read the top rated review which stated &#34; no white residue &#34; and thought I was in the clear -LRB- no pun intended -RRB- . I used the deodorant once and it began clumping and flaking just as any common white stick will . I will not risk ruining countless shirts as similar deodorants have in the past . Buyer be warned . If you want an invisible stick , this is not it .
 This product is very effective . It definetly reduces underarm wetness by atleast 70 % . The fragrance is also good and subtle . It does not interfere with the perfume fragrance.Now the folllowing problems :1 . There is something seriously wrong with the product . When you rotate the bottom lever for the wax to come on top , it comes up only after several rotations -LRB- even when using for the first few times -RRB- . And now , when you want the deodarant wax to go down , you rotate the lever , the other way round . But now , it does not go down . I use the plastic cap to press the wax down . Initially I thought the 1st package may be defective ; now I am using the 3rd one and that too is the same . Surprising , that unilever did not do this basic testing ? 2 . Now when you reach the last 30 % -LRB- after 15-20 uses -RRB- , the deodarant just suddenly breaks off into small pieces when applying . The pieces fall on the floor and its very difficult to clean , as they are like wax/oil .3 . I did notice some residue on the front side my light colored shirts , at the end of the day.In a nutshell , its a great product , with a very cheap packing .
 Thanks to this horrible deodorant , I have damaged over 20 shirts of mine . This deodorant works great and does the job , however you soon realise that all your shirts are becoming damaged . You will notice large yellow stains under the arms of the shirt , where you applied the deodorant . These stains DO NOT come out and your shirts will be permanently damaged . This is one of the worst products I have ever used . Stay far away from this horrible product or risk losing all your favorite shirts .
 I used this product once , the next morning I woke and under my arms were all pimples , all red , they got progessively worse and became infected . I had a follic infection which developed into a staph infection . This infection caused me to end up in the hospital where they had to lance the area and on antibiotics intravenously for 4 days . I have a scar now for the rest of my life . DO NOT USE THIS DEODARANT . Company is very reluctant to compensate on this product .
 I have just one link for you :[ ... -RSB- Do n't just purchase things because you `` hear '' about their efficiency . Do some research before you buy stuff.I believe in traditional Chinese medicine and many kinds of alternative medicine , but crap is still crap and in fact this illegitimizes real alternative medicine . This has been diluted TWO HUNDRED TIMES ; read up on what it is and how it 's made before you put it into your body.Fortunately this is nothing more than a placebo so at least you 're not harming anything but your wallet .
 PROS : There 's nothing in it to harm you . It 's just sugar.CONS : There 's nothing in it to help you . It 's just sugar.After purchase , I did some digging into this product 's origin , and into studies of its efficacy . Guess what ? It 's a ripoff . Clearly a triumph of marketing over science.You got me once , Boiron , you wo n't get me again .
 This item does not have enough information . No age is specified , no dosage , no directions for use . The image is small and only from the front of the box . It should contain a large image and one of the back also . The back has a lot of useful information .
 I tried this many years ago for a cold I had . Did NOTHING . Later I found out it did nothing because it has no active ingredients and based on nonsense known as `` homeopathy '' The idea more you dilute something the STRONGER it becomes . So of course of if you dilute it down to one part in 10 to the 400th power it must be strong stuff , NOT ! It 's a sugar pill with no active ingredients and no effect on colds or flu .
 The Battery looked like a second hand battery signs of leakBattery poles discoloured . Out of country on holiday will return item on return
 purchased and returned when found not to work . Item replaced and that one did not work either . The charger would not recognize either one .
 The item was shipped to me 3 days late and when I received it and try to use it found it was damaged and did not work try to charge it still did not work have tried to Contact your company for over 3 weeks and have not been resolved yet
 The UV light has a mind of its own when it comes to turning on . Tried changing batteries , but it makes no difference . Nice concept , but functions poorly .
 the product that i request is not get yet , please review your order and resend it to me i will wait one week more .
 Despite the description of Pediatric AND Infant stethoscope and despite the product description stating BOTH stethoscopes are ... The product is only ONE pediatric stethoscope , not one pediatric and one infant stethoscope as implied . No infant stethoscope is included in this product . The cost of this is ~ $ 20 higher than an individual pediatric scope again suggesting that paying a little more and bundling , you are getting TWO stethoscopes . Please be aware this is only ONE pediatric scope and does NOT include an infant scope .
 The shipping price of $ 9.95 was ridiculous - I ordered my speakers , which is about 1000 times heavier than the tiny studs I ordered , and I paid a significant amount less for the shipping . I recently got my cartilage pierced and purchased these studs for them . They were really cute so I took a pair out of its package today and tried them on in my original holes -LRB- in my lobes -RRB- . The posts were way too thick and it is impossible to remove the back from the post . My ears are in so much pain and they have been pierced for years . Why in the world would anyone pierce ears with these earrings . Do NOT order these earrings .
 I tried swithing to this product as an experiment but it backfired . I have used enough probioics products to know that it should calm my IBS symptoms and I should have less cramping and gas.HOWEVER , this product has almost zero effect on me . I dont think it is very good quality . They refused to refund my money also . I am very disappointed and going back to my old brand since it works .
 I did not have luck with this product and my intestinal cramping came back when I stopped my other brand and started using these . I tried them for about 2 weeks and then finally gave up .
 The pills that these probiotics come in are huge . They are about the same size as my fish oil pills . The smell is akin to rabbit food and leaves a nasty after-taste in my throat . Although this is based in `` whole food '' as it does state , I 'd rather go with a smaller pill that does n't smell or give an after taste -LRB- I am sticking with Pearls -RRB- .
 I bought this onsale thinking I 'd give it a try since the dual power Spray n Wash is no longer available -LRB- ughh !! -RRB- . This stuff did not work very well at all . I have to agree with the other review which stated that the product is somewhat blobby . . it does not penetrate the fabric and/or stain . It is just to thick of a mixture . It seems to work * slightly * better if the fabric is already wet . You will still experience `` runoff '' though - as in the product will just run off of the fabric instead of soaking into it . I will not buy this again and I do not recommend it at all . You would have much better luck just pre treating with your regular detergent , or letting the article soak in a water/detergent mixture for awhile before washing in the machine . I feel this SPray n Wash is a waste of money.On a sidenote , I REALLY wish they would bring back the dual action - the bottle that had dual chambers of clear and pink liquid - now that one really DID work on any stain you could think of , marvelously !
 I 've bought this product on two different occasions thinking it would be easier to use than the ` Spray-N-Wash Stain Stick ' which I usually use . It is easier to use , but it simply does not help to remove stains . Moreover , the perfume scent is overpowering and your whole load of laundry will end up smelling like it when one sprayed item is added . The Stain Stick -LRB- by the same company -RRB- is a far superior product as it actually works to remove stains and it is truly unscented . Do n't waste your money on this product .
 I keep trying different variety of Spray n Wash , hoping it will work at cleaning spots on our clothes . Sadly , it does n't seem to do much at all . Maybe on a very light , fresh dirt spot it will help , but on any kind of real spot -LRB- juice , ink , marker pen , grass , etc. ... -RRB- it seems to do nothing at all . Every year or so , I try a bottle of it , cause it 's on sale , or just for wishfull thinking , but it never does much.I always get out a bottle of bleach , and that takes care of it . I just wish I did n't have to deal with the bleach , but at least it works on real spots .
 I hoped that this listing was a joke , you can buy a bottle of this for $ 4.37 at Walmart . How is charging $ 15 a value ?!!
 Had I known this sold for only $ 5 at the store , I would NOT have paid $ 16 for it . Live and learn , I guess . I will not buy from here again .
 I love calgon as much as the next person but there is no way that this little bottle of Calgon is worth $ 38 !!!! This Merchant must be insane ... or think the rest of us are insane . This is jacked up at least 5 times higher than what it is worth.I had wanted some because my store was no longer carrying it ... but for this kind of highway robbery , I 'll drive a couple extra blocks to stop off at Krogers and buy it there . There is no excuse for this kind of fleecing and it should be investigated by Amazon .
 The price on this item is fair , but the shipping charge is `` easy money '' for the seller . Use google and you will find free shipping with the same price .
 I 'm not impressed with this soap at all . Does n't remove make up , leaves skin dry and clogged . Did n't notice any difference in acne improvement either .
 It always amazes me that an unnecessary ingredient such as fragrance is added to skin care products . Fragrance has been proven to be an irritant to many people with sensitive skin .
 i suffer from mild adult acne and decided to give this a shot after reading reviews here and on other sites . big mistake . my pimples are typically small and rarely are they painful and deep . within a week and a half i developed a cluster of deep , painful zits . weird , i thought , but did n't chalk it up to the soap . after another week of use i broke out in another set of deep , painful pimples on another area of my face . after that , i quit using immediately . the smell did n't bother me , but the massive zits did .
 We did not have good luck with this product . My skin -LRB- 46 -RRB- was not bad at all but I thought the product would be good for my skin . I actually broke out and I usually have no blemishes . My daughter -LRB- 15 -RRB- does break out and had several new break outs as soon as she started using the product . We will not be using this item .
 Resolve Triple Action , Trigger , 22-Ounce Bottles -LRB- Pack of 12 -RRB- After so much delay that I 'd given up ... my order for a pack of 12 Resolve Triple Action carpet cleaner arrived ! The first problem ? There was only one bottle , so the phenomenal discount was bogus ! Next the cleaner does n't resolve anything ; the trigger on the spray bottle does n't work and the product comes out in tiny dribbles . Woops -- did n't resolve a thing .
 I think the watch was ok quality , but was not loud enough . I will be returning this item . These talking watches the volkume definately should be much louder . Very hard to hear .
 I wanted to love these , but I just do n't . I am returning them . I wear a size 9 shoe , and these were actually slightly floppy on me . Additionally , the beads in the bottom do not lay flat across your entire foot when you have them on , which kind of defeats the purpose of keeping your feet warm . I took them off and shook them around until the beads were spread out uniformly , but the only way they stay like that is if you then just place your feet on the floor . If you want to prop your feet up , the beads then all shift down again and refuse to stay in place . I love their other products , but the design of this one is off . I 'll just stick with my old Gap slipper socks for now .
 These slippers are beautiful and very nicely packaged . However I did not understand when buying them that you can not walk in them . I think that 's important for someone to know . You remove and heat the soles , then replace them in the bottom of the slippers . It was hard to picture as described .
 Unfortunately these are a great idea for cold feet but they do n't work . The warming beads are in the sole and they move around and are very lumpy so you ca n't walk in the boots and in bed they shift around and the boot does n't stay in place and if you have to get out of bed you have to take them off you ca n't walk in them . A great idea but not quite workable . And costly at that .
 I received the product with an expiration good for another two full years . Upon opening , everything seemed fine and the product works to provide slight benefits to concentration , memory , and recall.However , a few days after opening , the capsules began to crack and become soft , and elicited a terrible odor . It is my understanding that these capsules are intended to break down in the presence of moisture ; but I heeded the recommendations and store the container in a cool and dry place . I can not explain the spontaneous wearing out other than by the lack of quality in the consideration of the capsule 's integrity . It is almost humorous to believe that exposure to the air initiated this breakdown . The pitfall of this design ? The pill loses its `` two-staged '' claim , works quickly , and wears out in a few short hours.Be aware that as this is a consumable dietary supplement classified as a grocery product , you can not return it .
 Capsules yellow and half-dissolved , with stronger-stench and powder outside . Obviously old and/or moist . I 'm in the midst of finals . CTD is obviously not a dependable merchant .
 I bought this watch for my sister and she has been using it for about a year . I 've had to reset the time and then re-synchronize the voice at least 4 times . Also , my sister is cognitively limited and the watch has way too many buttons that can be pushed by accident . When she bends her wrist up it pushes the buttons . I 'd like to replace it but do n't see a better option as of yet .
 I have to admit it is a well constructed item , but the maker tried to imitate phase cooling with a moisture absorbing polimer . It holds the moisture , but NOT the cooling . It just does n't do anything special , and since it holds the water , it does n't even provide evaporative cooling .
 I really wanted this to work ... but it did n't ! I purchased this at our local grocery store , because the Rubbermaid containers I wanted were out of stock . I am so sorry I did not wait to get the other brand . The lids of the EZ Store , which are supposed to fit each container , fit snugly only on the middle-sized containers . They lifted right off of the large and small containers -- they are neither air - nor water-tight -- they can barely hold food!I took the food out of the two large containers I was going to use , filled the containers with soapy water , set them on the counter , and 10 minutes later my counter was covered with water ! The containers were leaking through the bottoms.This product seems like a great idea , but in practice they simply do not work . They are very poorly manufactured .
 I wo n't comment on the quality of the items but the service is sloooow . i ordered 3 sets which they charged $ 20 for shipping alone . Estimated delivery was 3-5 days . already 6 business days have passed and still nothing in sight . I had ordered them on the basis that they will fulfill the order on time so I can take them overseas w / me , but now I guess I wo n't be able to take them w / me . what lousy service . On a different order previously for the body back buddy , they were supposed to include manual and the order came w / no manual . They tried to play it off as if the customer is ignorant by not mentioning anything . Contacted them and they offered to give back a few dollars for the missing manual . Just bear in mind extra delays when ordering this , and the extra shipping costs even if you have amazon prime .
 Another example of a cheap electronic product that is really quite expensive . Perhaps the most important switch , that permitting the time to be set , or reset in the case of return to standard time , failed after the clock was in use for only 4 weeks . The problem could have been anywhere , but my guess is the crappy filament switches , that can not be replaced , underneath the front-panel plastic buttons . My advice
 After a short period of time , only thing working was the flasher .
 Was hoping it would help with interstitial cystitis . After two days it caused a lot more pain instead . Will cut more foods out of my diet instead .
 It warms like it says it will but between applying it and such , the warmth caused it to not be as slick as I needed it to be .
 We bought 2 walkers , one from the hospital , and the second from Amazon . The hospital included Guardian Casters 5 inch swivel casters with the first walker . The casters came in an orange Guardian box and had Ref
 Had to reorder because when receive the glass bottle was busted !!! Did not hear back from company when I sent email .
 The smaller letters have very poor ink resolution and are hard to read , so the item does n't really serve its purpose to test vision .
 I agree with the other review that gave it 1 star . the small print is smudged and faint at best . Quality is horrible . Ca n't even see it close up let alone 14 '' away .
 Whatever printer was used for the card did not have good resolution . The numbers and letters for 20/20 vision and a couple of other fields are blurred and you ca n't tell what they are supposed to be even if you can see well . Even though it was cheap , I would n't purchase it again .
 The product came packaged very well , but the letters were smudged and barely readable on the card.For a card used to do vision screening the letters should be clear and crisp , which these were not.Will probably work for tuning skis though , scraping old wax off , about the only thing it is good for.So if you are looking for this for using in medicine , as I was , I would definitely look elsewhere !!
 I received this in the mail , and I am extremely disappointed with the quality . The cards are flimsy plastic that one can see through , which is a problem when testing vision . The print is blurry which affects vision . As an ophthalmologist , nobody should be using these cards , not med students , not nurses , and especially not ophthalmologists . They are of very poor quality and highly unreliable . My mistake , I guess you always get what you pay for.On another note , the shipping time and packaging was perfect . Unfortunately that does n't help the product quality.And one more note , I contacted the seller , and they immediately -LRB- within a minute responded and offered a refund -RRB- . Excellent customer service . -LRB- But again , unfortunately that does n't help the product quality . -RRB-
 Same thickness as a piece of paper . Really low quality . Could do better at any med school bookstore or med supply shop . This thing truly is a piece of crap .
 Item was of poor quality -- chart letters were crooked in some areas , smudged in other areas . Would not recommend this product .
 The ink on this is very blotchy and the card is translucent . The smallest and second smallest numbers are missing parts due to the blotchy ink . It makes the card virtually useless . The card being translucent also makes for a bad eye exam . I am a medical student and thought I 'd live with this until I saw a WAY better card for the same price in my campus bookstore . I did n't realize just how bad this one way until I saw how good they can be . I 'd buy one somewhere else instead of this very poor version .
 cheap , but really worth about 25c , print is smudged , double printed/poor quality , plastic was dent , so cheap and unprofessional , ca n't use for patients . Do n't get it . Pay more get a better one . I wish the company would stop selling this cheap dip and charge more for a better one .
 This item is very small for an eye exam . I had expected to have a larger chart for eye exam . I wish I had time to return this item .
 I have back pain and foot pain so I thought , after watching the infomercial , that this was just what I needed after hearing all the testimonials . I liked the fact that the heal was low , kind of like the Earth shoe of the 70 's . But they neglected to tell you that the arches were not flexible but very hard plastic . The arches hurt like hell and I used the lowest one -LRB- they provide three different heights of arches . -RRB- . Also , it took forever for them to get here . Almost a month ! -LRB- I ordered from the Walkfit company , not Amazon . -RRB- I paid $ 10 shipping . What were they using ? Pony Express ? Anyhow , when I called the company about the pain , -LRB- I could n't walk with them more than a few minutes -RRB- they told me I would have to get used to them but if I have foot problems I may never get used to them . WHAT ??? The infomercial targets people WITH foot problems providing a list of various ailments such as heel spurs etc. . Anyhow , I tried again and then the next day and so on for a few weeks . I really wanted them to work for me . Just hurt so bad I had to return them . After returning them , I had to call the company because the refund was also taking forever . When I called them about not receiving my refund -LRB- which was two weeks after they got the package according to my tracking number -RRB- they said they did n't put the refund through yet . A month later , I still did not receive the refund . I did eventually get the refund but had to call them three times . Crappy way to do business.Anyhow , this is not the product that I expected , especially since they target people who are having problems walking but the product made it even harder to walk and painful .

 Ordered WalkFit inserts for myself and my fiancee . Followed their instructions for about 10 days -LRB- 3 days past their `` break in '' period -RRB- . I could n't wait to get them out of my shoes by the end of the day . Foot adjusted somewhat , but not that much . Same with my fiancee . Decided to return them.Sent them back via UPS with deliver confirmation and signature . Walk Fit received them back in mid-September , 2005 . No refund given as of yet . No returned emails or phone calls to customer service.Bottom line
 you really ca n't buy orthotic 's on line , these just did not work for me , I think you need to try them on before you buy
 Simply put do not order this product , I ordered from them and a monthlater was charged an additional $ 50 for something I did not order fromthem , so far they have refused to refund this unauthorized charge.When you call their CS # you get some idiot in India who is of nohelp , as usual.If you choose to use this product keep a close eye on you bank acct.I will be contacting my bank as well as my state atty. general.I do n't like thieves and this company is a bunch of thieves !!!!
 There is a reason this product was so cheap . It was garbage . Sent it back right after buying it . Awkward fit , cheap materials , and painful to wear . If it was possible to get zero stars that would have been the true rating .

 I ordered Walk Fit Orthotics by Phase4 and was extremely disappointed . They are hard , rigid and painful to wear.I was unable to use it in any of my shoes . I called `` As Seen on TV Products '' customer service to complain and they were very rude . I still have the product and it 's useless .

 A friend recommended this to me , but how are you supposed to know what size to order ? There 's no information given to explain the letter sizes . What , do I just order a `` D '' because it 's my lucky letter or something ? No help on any of the product 's non-Amazon sites about what the letters mean either . I may come back and revise my review based on product performance , but right now the lack of info about sizes is just making me angry .
 I have had flat feet with low weak arches since I was in my teens or younger -LRB- 30 YO male -RRB- . I got these because I thought I needed arch support.These inserts eased much of pain in my feet , but made them feel weird . I developed callouses on the inside of my arch where the orthotic did not exactly match my foot . Walking barefoot was more uncomfortable , I found myself twisting my ankle more often.I used these for two or so years , first with the small insert , then medium . They soften up , or become deformed , so I replaced them whenever I got a new pair of shoes . I had a set in every pair of shoes or boots I owned.Two years ago I switched -LRB- very slowly -RRB- to Vibrams and this year went barefoot as much as possible . Doing this has strengthened my arch dramatically . I can see and feel the difference and I no longer need any orthotics . My mother , who would worry about my feet , noticed that when I was walking on the beach my arch was not even touching the sand . My feet honestly felt like rocks.These will provide you with temporary relief , but if you really want to solve the problem you need to strengthen the bones , muscles and tendons in your feet .
 I would n't waste your money . I used them for over a month and had absoultely no change . Not only that but the company is underhanded . When they charge you almost as much for shipping as they do for the product something is wrong . I paid 34.90 for the inserts -LRB- one for my wife and one for me -RRB- and they charged me 24.85 for the shipping and I just used regular shipping , nothing like overnight or 2 day . Ridicules considering it only cost 5.00 dollars to ship .
 I 'm glad these work for some people . They did not help me . Felt like walking on golf balls -LRB- used lowest insert -RRB- . Tried working up on time used , a little at a time , the longer I used them , the worse my feet hurt . I believe you have to have very very high arch to use .
 I buy a lot of stuff via my t.v. and computer.I have never had any problems with returns before.But then I must have been dealing with honest companies.Not only did these things make the pain in my feet 10 times worse ... now I 'm out $ 92.00 . To say I 'm sorry I ordered them would be an understatement .
 They hurt the minute I put them on and it only got worse . What a rip . A lot of hype for nothin .

 I have bought orthotic insoles by Phaze 4 in the past and was happy with them . These `` new and improved '' models are terrible ... The arch is so high I can not wear them in any of the shoes I have without being terrible painful ... I can stand the arch , but they make my shoes too tight ... The older model I bought was nearly identical to the more expensive ones I had bought at the Good Feet Store . The new model is completely different , and not in a good way .
 Ow . Owowowowow . Do Not Mistake These for actual orthotics made for your unique feet . In fact , these I found to be painful and counter-productive . I bought these as a stop-gap to actual orthotics to straighten out my knees and the Walk Fits radically affected my gait , stride and shape on my foot . The podiatrist I finally got to see scolded me for making my orthotics a much more expensive proposition by first wearing a non-specific insole that did not address my feet , but rather was a commercial One Size Fits All.I 'd be very very careful about putting these in your shoes .
 I wear a size 8.5 B with a medium low arch and have purchased professionally made orthotics for 20 years for arch support . These walkfit insoles are terribly uncomfortable . The interchangeable arch -LRB- low , med , high -RRB- are too far forward . I ca n't imagine anyone having an arch close to the ball of the foot . Forget trying to get your money back from the manufacture for it is too much of a hassle .
 I probably have plantar fasciitis . I say `` probably '' because no doctor has officially diagnosed me . But the symptoms fit to a `` T '' those descriptions in dozens , if not hundreds of Googled results . The extreme pain with the first steps in the morning ; the pain if you squeeze your heel at any time ; everything points to plantar fasciitis.I 've tried dozens of Dr. Scholl 's - type inserts , worn different shoes , not much result . So I decided to try this so-called `` miracle '' treatment.Upon first walking around with the insert , I too , like many people , felt that the inserts were extremely hard and uncomfortable , but I stuck it out , like they said . Now I ca n't remember why , but I stopped using them.A couple of years later

 This product make me a plantar fascitis with an strong pain in my foot , bad , bad , bad , bad , bad and very very bad
 One of my Chiropractic patients LOVED these inserts and since I am always on the search of an inexpensive alternative for my patients for shoe orthotics I was excited to buy these . OMG , the immediate pain even using the lowest adapter was crippling ! I made an effort to adapt to them too . I even tried removing the arch supports and replacing them with cut-out cardboard hoping I would slowly adapt and be able to eventually use the lowest of the three arches supplied . No joy.But it is probably me because every orthotic I have ever tried have hurt my feet . I believe there are those of us who just can not use any orthotic and I am one of those folks . I do n't have flat feet but my shoe size has increased by 1 or 2 sizes and width over the past 30 of my 60 years so I know that my arches have fallen and I need support ... just not these.On the bright side , these are very well made and since they are `` arched '' and not `` flat '' like some solid orthotics they `` hover '' over the shoe 's built-in arch . This is exactly what you need to use arch supports in shoes that do not have removable arch inserts like dress shoes because otherwise you will end up with too high an arch prescription . Also the price is right ; good general purpose orthotics can be much more expensive . Also the fact that they come with 3 heights is terrific
 I ordered the insoles to fit my work boots . The heel support was good . The problem that I have with the soles is that they are not long enough for my feet . They do not ride properly centered onto the crest of my arch . This caused improper support and pain throughout my feet . I have size 13 wide feet and ordered the largest size avaialble .
 These things were SOOOOO painful ! The arches in my feet are high , but not that damn high , good lord ! I took the blue middle section out , and they STILL hurt like hell . They 're just not for me ... at . all . I 've gone back to wearing my old pair . I 'd hoped these would work as an economical option , seeing as I no longer have health insurance , but no sir ! I 'll just have to live with my old ones until I 'm properly covered again in the future.I 'm now trying to decide what to do with these new ones ... I guess throwing them away is my only option . Oh well .
 I am a hiker and have a ball of foot problem on my right foot . I was looking for something to take the pressure off the front of my foot and thought these were worth a try . On first trying them I found them very uncomfortable , especially in my trail shows which have some of their own arch support . The pressure on the arch area , with the lowest insert , was more than I expected . I found that my hiking boots , with no arch support and with the original inserts removed , were tolerable with the walkfit so I decided to try wearing them . I started by wearing them to work , then for a short walk -LRB- about a mile -RRB- and gradually up to a longer hike -LRB- 6 miles , significant elevation change -RRB- . The walkfit was never comfortable , but it did take the pressure off the front of my foot by putting more of the weight on my arch . During the hike I developed a bruise on my arch and decided that these were n't for me.I think these could be a good option if the arch area had some padding and if the inserts were permanent so they stay in place .
 I wish I had known that this tea was so bitter . I added honey but that did not help . Can someone please make a suggestion as to what I can do ? I have n't been able to drink it .
 ok let me first start out by saying the end all thing , I am a transgender . No one would ever guess that I was born male because I look and sound female , I get clocked as female without a second glance . Now , the product , lets look at the label `` Feminizing Breast Enlargement Pills and Cream Duo for Crossdressing , Transgender and Transvestite Men '' Let me first start off by saying if your product cant tell the difference between Crossdresser , Transgender , and Transvestite , and calling all 3 men , then we have a bit of a problem . Ok the first is a crossdresser
 I bought this thinking it was like anouther product i perchased befour and the pills are so differint as well as the cream.was going to return it but thought about it more and thought i would give it a try.needless to say that i am alergic to the cream and have had cemical burn on my chest for a week or more . so this is why i only rated one star tho i should go with none but i have still taken the pills and have had no change yet.but i hope they will work without the cream .
 Ordered for disabled family member and I never gave it to her - too dangerous looking - they should discontinue this model . Sorry !
 I had such high hopes when I searched for this , and saw all the positive reviews ! A good night sleep has eluded me for a long time . . it said the bet results would be achieved after 2-3 nights . . so i gave that a try ... each successive night got worse ... last night after being unable to relax i got up and was unable to fall asleep till 5 am . Not sure why this did not work since i know all the herbs in it are good for producing sleep . . but it did not work for me at all .
 For some reason , this product had the opposite effect on me . I did n't get any feelings of relaxation or sleepiness . It did not provide any pain relief . The worst thing was that I tossed and turned all night , feeling like I drank a bunch of coffee . I tried it for several nights just to make sure it was this herb and not something I ate . The same thing happened every night .
 I did not get much effect from taking this . I got much better effect from taking a magnesium supplement along with my calicum one . Maybe it 's because my insomnia had a different cause than the other people who wrote reviews ?
 I dont think I can really rate this product in fairness . I take Ambien and have for years . I 'm trying herbal sleep products in hopes of finding something to help me go to sleep other than Ambien . I have tried many different herbal sleep meds . They do absolutely nothing for me . But if you have never taken prescription sleep meds this may very well work for you . But for me it did not . I dont know that there is any herbal product that will work for me . If you are not used to prescription sleep meds , then I would try at least once.I buy everything thru Amazon . They are the only company I ever order through . I trust them . Products come quickly , no damage , or if you want , easy return .
 According to their measurements , I was supposed to get size E . They were n't comfortable , so I asked my chiropractor who suggested I get these . He stated that their measurements are wrong & that I should get size J or K . He had extras.I sent them back to the location that was included in the box , but I have n't received them . I 'm hoping I get them shortly , but it 's now been 3 weeks .
 I can tell no difference in my foot pain from wearing these insoles . It could just be that they do n't work for me . My feet do n't hurt less and they do n't hurt more . I have tried them while walking on the street , on the treadmill , and on the eliptical . Normally I would n't even bother to write a review , I would just chalk it up to another junky product like so much other garbage on the market out there.My main beef is with their customer service people . Of course they barely speak intelligible english but that 's par for the course . I have called twice and they have been extremely rude both times . They charged me more than I expected and had calculated for the product and could not give me a decent explanation . They were so rude and spoke right over me and never gave me an opportunity to get a word in edge wise . Honestly , even if the product had worked well , they 'd never get business from me again.One piece of advice - `` Expedited Shipping '' to these people means about two weeks . I do n't recommend it .

 Order via Potters Gifts , I never receive the item . The item shows that it was delivered but I never receive it . Email them to inform them of the issue , and they wanted me to track it down . This is a small ticket item , under $ 20 , it is too petty and they stated that they can not trust me . Unlike other companies they would resend the item and track the lost item . Never order anything with pottersgifts .
 I 've bought Ray-O-Vac batteries for the past couple of years , because of their low cost and the fact that their AA batteries worked as well as the more expensive brands . About 18 months ago , I bought 16 Ray-O-Vac `` Maximum Plus Alkaline '' `` D '' - cell batteries , a 12-pack and a 4-pack , and put them in my emergency kit . Each set was labeled as good until Dec. 2016 . My emergency kit was kept dry and in a closet at room temperature . Tonight I got out the kit to use some of the batteries and found that all my Ray-O-Vac batteries were corroded . I ca n't return them to Ray-O-Vac for replacement because I did n't keep the original sales slip.It 's a good battery at a good price , but do n't plan on storing them for any length of time .
 To simple , they dont look elegant at all , and to make them a little pretty you really have to have them profesionally printed and there goes your money , I 'm really thinking of buying new invitations . the really dont look like the ones in the picture . But hey they could have been worst ...
 Our son has a metabolic disorder that is helped by taking biotin . These capsules were very small compared to other brands of 5 mg biotin capsules we 'd purchased . After a few weeks on these , my son became symptomatic again . We switched him to GNC brand 5 mg capsules and he stabilized . It is my opinion that these capsules did not contain a full 5 mg of biotin or that they did not contain biotin at all . The FDA really does n't regulate vitamins well , so those of you taking them for medical reasons should find a reliable manufacturer . Country Life is not reliable . I wanted to give this product zero stars , but the application would not let me do that -- so consider my rating zero stars .
 This product does not work , it 's a lot less effective than the previous hair , skin & nail product I 'd been taking . Frankly , I do n't believe that the product does anything at all . I began taking hair , skin & nail vitamins because -LRB- 1 -RRB- I have nail discoloration -LRB- dark streaks -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- I wanted fuller , longer hair . For the past year , I 'd taken GNC 's Hair , Skin & Nail formula which seemed effective -LRB- the dark streaks in my nails were less noticeable , my nails grew QUICKLY and my hair became marginally fuller -RRB- . I decided to give Country Life Biotin a try to see if there 's a more effective product on the market . In short , this product does NOT work . My nails stopped growing -LRB- I used to have to cut them every 4 days , once I stopped taking the GNC product and switched to Country Life Biotin I only had to trim every 2 wks ... growth halted -RRB- , also , the dark streaks have returned ! I wish that I could give this product back . I will try another biotin product and if that does not work , return to GNC 's Hair , Skin & Nails .
 These were over expensive and broke me out soooo badly omg . took 3 years to clear the spots . If you are looking for vitamnins for hair and skin , I say get Country Life Maxi Hair , they are much better . Not these ACNE pills . Ugh
 I should have known since they are so inexpensive ! When I opened the bottle white powder went everywhere like the pills were falling apart . I threw them out !
 I got this cream . Worked great nice lather . The cap cover was broken right out the box so I could not screw it back on . The cream itself was great as reviewed . I only got a few uses out of it as it started drying out . You would think the product would have better packaging for what the company makes itself out to be . Bottom line get the tub not the travel tube .
 As my title says , there are a lot better `` green foods '' type products on the market . Taste is not near as good as Now Foods Phytofoods , Magma Plus or the Green Vibrance I tried.Ingredient list does not hold a candle to any of the three products I mentioned above , and the prices for the three are actually lower per ounce . After multiple trial and errors I decided the Green Vibrance -LRB- approx 1 dollar a serving -RRB- is the best quality for the money , if you are on a budget the Now Foods Phytofoods has a 2 pound bottle that knocks the price per serving around .50 cents.Still shaking my head why Daily Greens wants almost $ 30 for 10 ounces for an inferior product .
 Perhaps this works for callus but definitely not as cushions in your shoes . The footprint is small and padding is hard . If you are looking to purchase to put in heels or pumps as I did - look at other products .
 The product did not stay on the ball of the foot as advertised . This was a product failure , not a merchant or Amazon failure .
 This item gave me no relief from the callous on the ball of my foot . Did not help at all . In fact my foot hurt more with this on . It was a waste of money for me.Maybe it works if you wear it always ... . that is , prior to developing a callous .
 I can not tell you how happy I am about this product . I have had metatarsal pain from golfing and working out for 10 years . It became so bad that I was thinking of having surgery on my hammer toes . I have spent thousands of dollars on shoe inserts , metatarsal pads , and orthotics . Most of these products require you to buy new shoes , because they will not fit in your normal size shoe . About 6 months ago , I came across this produt during a Google search for something new . I almost did not buy it because it says `` callus '' cushion , but then I saw a blog from a runner stating that he used it for metatarsal pain . I felt almost immediate relief , and now after 6 months I am pain free . Here are a few things I learned through trial and error . 1 . The adhesive on the pad is temperature sensitive . When you remove the pad from your foot at the end of each day , rinse it only in COLD water . Hot water will remove the adhesive and ruin the pad . 2 . One pad has lasted for 6 months . I put it on in the morning , and remove it at night . It has not lost any adhesion so far . I am curious to see how long they will last . 3 . Metatarsil pads are placed just BEHIND the metatarsil bone to lift the foot and remove pressure from the bone . With this product , you should place it about an inch further forward so it lifts your foot , but also slightly overlaps your metarsal . This means it is actually placed about an inch back from what you see in the product brochure . They are showing placement for a callus . The gel actually cushions the bone and allows for healing . 4 . This product is designed to stick to clean dry skin . Once in place , it does not move . I read other reviews saying that it slips around . They are doing something wrong , because I run 5 miles and wear it all day , and it NEVER moves or falls off . I will update this once the product wears out , if ever.Update 10/22/12 - I just changed my review from 5 to 2 stars . That is because I finally had to buy a new pair of cushions , and they are NOT NEARLY as sticky as the old ones . They changed their formulation . In addition , the new ones have a slight beveled edge . They stick slightly to the ball of my foot , but this is clearly not good enough to wear all day . I am going to try another supplier I found on Google . I will report back with my findings.Update 10/31/12 - I have been wearing the new cushions I received from CarolWrightGifts.com for over a week . These are the same gel pads that I originally received from Amazon . They are a darker color blue , softer , more flexible , and THEY STICK LIKE GLUE . I am wearing them all day and they never release or move . Great product !
 Difficult to keep in place and not effective.It appears by how it looks in the photo to be a fine soft to use product but it is not .
 Does not stay in place ... poor adhesion . Had hoped this would be the solution for metatarsal cushioning for someone on their feet 10 hrs a day walking between 6-7 miles a day . Design seemed to do the job so was disappointed it would not stay put !
 This pad might work if it would stay in place long enough , but it slips out of place on very short walks , making it totally worthless to me .
 I was so impressed with some of the reviews , I bought 2 sets of pads and could not wait for them to come because I was having some much pain on my left metatarsal . This pad is horrible !!!!!!!!!!!! It made my pain worse . The pain got so bad it went all the way up my leg and was burning so bad . The pad is too thick , so it takes up too much room in your shoe which makes the pain so bad . Also , it dose n't stay in place . The pads ended up all the way down by me heels . Not worth the money !!!!!! Try Footminder 's catwalk orthotics They are great !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sorry FootSmart this product is not good .
 I have brought other products from FootSmart and they work great . This product was a dud . I do not recommend it .
 The gel cushion feels great to the touch , however it does not always stay in place . It can easily be misplaced or lost , especially if you like to remove your shoes at work or anywhere just to rest your tired feet . The gel cushion is an excellent idea however a little more tweaking could have gone into it and , as for the price of the small gel cushion , it could have given you more for your money -LRB- larger or extra gel cushions -RRB- . I am constantly misplacing one of the gel cushions , has anyone found it ? . Truly disappointed.Cat47
 I wanted to order these TWICE . The product seems great , the company ... not so great.I placed two orders with FootSmart . Both did not go well . Terrible , listless customer service at the 800 # and no help from the customer service link listed on the Paypal site . A computer generated response from the customer service link assured me an agent would contact me soon . That did not happen . Both times I spoke with customer service they could care less and were limited on what they could do and on knowledge . The first item was not advertised clearly , so I was told to cancel/re-order to adjust it ... Then on the second order I paid for overnight which I was ultimately charged for , but on the email receipt -LRB- received the next day -RRB- they slated it for 2-3day anyway . Even their email receipt showed that the cost of the item and the `` standard '' freight they assigned , cost LESS than what the total amount they were charging me -LRB- which was still an overnight amount -RRB- . They werent going to even contact me , but just charge a gastly overnight rate and send it standard.I was listlessly told an email would follow showing the orders were canceled . Ya right . I have to keep checking my paypal account to ensure that it is n't still `` pending '' charges . FootSmart seems to have some cool products , but do n't expect fast shipping or good communication if there is a problem . Hopefully if you order something , it will arrive in 7-10 days , you 'll be charged correctly and the computer generated receipt is all you end up needing .
 The product broke the 3rd time we used it and despite repeated phone calls and emails we received no response . I would have returned and re-ordered but was unable to get any response . One of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had . I would not recommend dealing with this company .
 Sonic Super Ear Plus -LRB- SE7500 -RRB- - Personal Sound AmplifierI have this same companies PSA 8000 and with the $ 30 Sennheiser ear buds it is excellent as I say in my review of it . Worse , instead of the $ 65model they sent me the $ 80 kit including items that are useless . The sellercharges a 25 % restocking fee .
 Only tried it once , but we did n't notice it doing much of anything for us
 The product was n't what we ordered . we received covidien brand which didn ' fit ' Cocidien took over from kendall , but the product did n't work out . WE HAVE RECEIVED A REFUND , and are happy now with the way the refund was handled
 I purchased these for my mom . She was intending to order socks that had a closed toe . Because she had no idea what `` inspection toe '' meant in the description , and one of the images showed a sock which does have a closed toe , she assumed it was the right product and I ordered it for her . When they arrived with a toe opening , I contacted the seller to return them . Not only do I have to pay for shipping but I also incur a 20 percent restocking fee ! Essentially , I am only getting half of a refund all because the item description is not very clear . I noticed a few other reviews that say they had the same problem .
 My mdse was listed incorrected . Nowhere in the discription did it say anything about a peekaboo toe . These stockings are for people who ca n't walk and need their feet checked . I on the other hand need the stocking for walking , so the hole in the bottom of the stocking makes them unuseable for me . The mdse did not come with an order form or a return slip . So when I went back to Amazon online , to see what i had to do to return the hose , I found a phone number where you could reach the company . After many attempts and messages , no one ever contacted me from this company . I have since put a claim into my credit card , and maybe someday I 'll be able to get the hose I need .
 This product makes you feel awful . I 'm done with it . Stomach aches , headaches , chest pains , trouble breathing , you name it . And I only took 2 a day ! The package says you can take up to 6 a day ! I ca n't imagine taking 6 . I 'm going to try losing weight the old fashioned way ... no more diet pills for me .
 I also have a friend who had severe chest pains from taking this drug
 My daughter tried this stuff first and hated it . It made her feel sick but also disoriented . She was trying to read a magazine but could n't understand a word of it . She gave them to me and I took one before heading off to a meeting . I was asked to take the minutes but really struggled to concentrate to do so . I suddenly felt so jittery and dizzy . I could n't focus on any object or understand what was being said . I was afraid I would have a heart attack or something . I had a very disoriented and disconnected feeling . Thank God I was n't driving ! This is definately not a good product for many people .
 The first day I took this I thought I was about to pass out.I got real hot and then my ears felt like they needed to pop . My throat felt like it was going shut I was trying to cough and could n't . Then my neck started itching bad.Then the rest of the day I just had a huge headache.Then that night I felt exhausted ! Like I was coming down w / the flu or something .
 My sister took 2 pills a day for only 2 days , she has stopped taking it for another 2 days and is now hospitalzed . She still has chest pain , shaking , and difficulty breathing and swallowing . She was perfectly healthy before taking xantrex3
 I bought this product after having taken Diet Fuel w / ephedra several years ago . I needed energy this time and to lose a few extra baby pounds . Within minutes of taking my FIRST and ONLY pill I had a horrible reaction . I broke out in WELTS within 10 minutes all over my body . I was shaky and sick to my stomach . I drank 5 glasses of milk to neutralize it and finally started to feel better . I thought I was going to die . My only thought was there was no way losing weight was worth never seeing my kids again . After about 2 hours the welts disappeared but I felt horrible for the rest of the day . Obviously there is something in it that does n't get along with my body but after that reaction I had I have decided that no diet pill is worth the chance of what can happen to you .
 This gave me no energy and made me sick to my stomach . It did not help me lose any weight and was a waste of money . Too bad I ca n't get my hands on anything with ephedra ... that was the onlt thing that worked !!!
 I used this for 2 months , nothing happened I did exercise as well . All this thing did was made me sick to the stomach and feel nausea all day and sleep loss
 I chose this rating because I threw the bottle away after 4 dys of use . I am not sensitive to caffeine or products with high caffeine content but I had terrible headaches during my 4 dys of use ! They started on first day of use and stopped once I discontinued use . I prefer green teas pills but thought I would try something new , bad choice .
 I agree with the person who wrote the very long review about it . Try starting to lose weight with something else . I 'll tell you why.I personally need to lose over 50 lbs , I started with this , and have lost NO WEIGHT !!! Maybe for some people it does work , but not for me . I didnt exercise with it so maybe thats why it didnt work , thats why I gave it two stars.But the REAL POINT of my review , is that they specifically say to take these and you dont need diet and exercise , well they are totally MISLEADING !! I guess I should have used COMMON SENSE to realize you always need diet and exercise to lose weight.But I might go try XENADRINE !! Cause I have used that in the past and lost over 35lbs , I will go with what I know works .
 I first saw this on a commercial and decided to do some research . I clicked on the first couple of links and read only good-great reviews . I should have known better , being from a marketing backgroud with search engines ... only the positive reviews are listed first . Well , I bought the blue pills and took my first pill this morning . I only took one pill and ate breakfast -LRB- and a ton of water -RRB- within the next 30 minutes . Let me tell you that it has been over 12 hours since I just took ONE capsule and I still feel miserable . From the get-go , I started to feel disoriented . Then , came the uncontrollable urination , then the non-stop vomiting , never-ending dizzines and lastly , consistent jitters . I really felt like this was the start of what an overdose would feel like . I kept drinking water , even drank some milk . This stimulant is supposed to give you energy to work out , but how can you work out if you instantly start feeling adverse symptoms ? False advertising if you ask me . Imagine if I had taken the `` recommended dosage '' of 2 capsules with two main meals . After feeling the way I have felt today , I have realized I would rather have some chunkies than to be the desparate person who will continue to experience symptoms and be miserable and skinny . It is simply not worth it .
 I have tried many diet pills . I always say this ... as a past gym trainer and an expert on diet and nurtition , diet pills should ONLY be used as an extra help in losing the last 10 lbs or so . They should n't ever be depended on alone .75 % of any results will always be HOW YOU EAT . . plain and simple . Working out with light weights or heavy weights also gREATLY helps . But even if you work out 5 hours a day , and eat nothing but fat and high sugar foods , your results will take forever to see . . or you will only keep packing on the lbs.Ok . . so I started taking these about 5 years ago . I had taken Stacker 2 's before and Hydroxycut , and even Trim Spa . Let me say . . all those give you a `` boost '' of energy . . and slight gitters . . BUT . . I have never had the jitters that bad -- until THIS product.DO NOT TAKE THIS . I was only 25 when I took these and mind you -- I was already working out 1 hour a day , and eating clean . . I mainly used these to lose about 5lbs . . I DID lose about 10 with these . . do n't get me wrong here ... BUT ... I was only taking TWO pills a day -- one in morning -- and one at night . THAT was all I took . -LRB- I honestly NEVER take a full serving in ANY diet pill -RRB- just because I feel they are loaded with way too much caffiene . -RRB- . . After taking only 1 of these , , . and took a light nap . . a few hours later . . I was getting dressed in the bathroom . . and started having a panic attack . I NEVER had those before . I do n't even have any health problems . I do n't even ever get panic attacks . . never knew what one was actually like . I felt I was having a minor heart attack or something -LRB- minus the chest pains or any nausea -RRB- . . I was scared SH **** LESS . I had to run over to my husband and have him hold me just because I felt I could n't breath.This pill is dangerous in my opinion . And again , I was n't even taking a full dosage.not even close . > : -LRB- Then after taking the pills I kept having panic attacks for a few months there afterward ... even tho I stopped taking them after that . -LRB- maybe it was a mind thing after that -RRB- . I even started having panic attacks when I switched to ZERO caffine Hydroxycut . . and they have no jitters at all ! I even could n't drink coffee for months because I was sooo scared that I would start panic-ing . I remember one night I could n't go to sleep because I felt like I was going to pass out.DONT TAKE THESE . PERIOD.Infact ... drinking 12 cups of Green Tea a day works even better -- AND gets rid of bloating . ; -RRB- Save your money ... and save your life by NOT ever taking these . !!
 i take zentrex 3 but it made sick all day . please dont spend your money on something that doest work .
 I went home over the summer and decided to buy this because , yeah , I wanted to lose weight and I did n't have the energy to work out . When I took it I could n't sleep for more than four hours and it was hell trying to get those few hours . I did n't feel like I lost weight , but when I returned to college a friend said I looked like I had gotten thinner , though my clothes felt tight . This was a few months ago and I stopped taking them when I returned until a little over a week ago when I needed to stay awake to study for exams . Oddly , this time they did n't keep me awake . At first there were no side effects until I stopped taking them . I have never been so paranoid and scared of dying in my sleep . Almost a week after , my heart races at odd moments , depression hits me like a bus as well as anger , my breath is shorter , and I 'm scared out of my mind . My body feels weird as hell . I only took one pill a day with a large glass of water and I am usually tolerant of caffeine , but not this stuff.The only good thing about my experience is that my winter coat fits more comfortably than it did a few weeks ago . But I 'd gladly trade the weight loss for peace of mind . It 's just too f ***** g scary .
 So . How did I end up in the ER TWICE because of these pills . So , 6yrs ago a friend told me about Zantrex and encouraged me to try it . I took 1 pill a day for a couple of weeks and was super excited to see the pounds MELT off of my body . I got SO skinny ! I figured I could try to double the dose and took 2 pills . BIG mistake . Had a MAJOR panic attack -LRB- ? -RRB- and ended up in the ER thinking I was dying . Shaking , couldnt breath , irregular hearth beat . Very scary . Just a horrible feeling ! I threw away my bottles and staid away from all types of dietpills . . Fast forward a couple of years . My daughter was almost 1 , we were going to Hawaii and I still had a few baby pounds to drop . . PANIC . . lets try Zantrex again . 1 pill and I could tell right away that it was BAD . Of course I ended up in the ER again and I ended up having to see my reg . DR 2 more times the following days for EKG 's showing irregular heartbeat and I had to take anti-anxiety meds for a couple of weeks . HORRIBLE !! I dont know why no ones has sued the manufacturer ! So MANY perfectly healthy people have ended up in the hospital after taking this supplement ! I havent touched this stuff in 3yrs and I NEVER EVER will again !
 These pills literally almost killed me . From the first time I used them , I was so hyper I thought my heart was going to burst , I had dizziness and I was feeling really sick . DO N'T USE THIS , FOR REAL !!!!
 I took this for 2 weeks & threw the bottle out . It gave me a caffeine buzz , but I had no weight loss - in fact I gained a couple pounds . I did exercise & drink tons of water . I do n't overeat in calories . And one day I coupled it with a thyroid enhancer that is suppose to be safe with other diet supplements & I should have gone to the emergency room with all the negative symptoms I had . I 'm glad this works for some people , but I would n't recommend it to anyone .
 I have been taking zantrex-3 for a month now , and have not lost a pound . I drink more than enuff water , watch and limet what I eat and exercise . I have only lost 2-3 lbs . Witch is more than likley from the exercise and watching what i eat.This product sux
 My husband and I started taking this product ... I got chest pains , trouble breathing , so nausated I could n't ride in a car . and I felt like I was freaking out ... my eyes were real darty ... horrible feeling . My husband broke out in a rash all over ... I mean ALL OVER ... even the unmentionables . He itched every where . We both experience weight gain and bloatedness . NO WEIGHT LOSS at all . We bought this at GNC for $ 59.00 , not knowing it was here . SO Price does n't always mean better product . If there was a NO STAR catagory this would n't even qualify for that .
 I started Zantrex 3 on the recommended dosage , two pills before a major meal . Within fifteen minutes I was nauseated , had the shakes , a headache , and a stomachache for the rest of the day . The next day I took only one pill before breakfast and still felt sick the entire day . There is hardcore caffeine in these that leaves you feeling dope sick even after you stop taking it . I had fitful sleep when I finally did fall asleep , even though I had n't taken a pill in over ten hours . The prospect of losing fifteen pounds in two weeks does not outweigh how horrible you feel while you 're taking the pill .
 My husband took this as directed for `` 1 '' day and at 1:00 am that night he had a very bad Grand Mal Seizure.He had never had any type of seizure before and was rushed via ambulance to the hospital . I thought he was dying in front of my eyes , after the seizure , he was choking for air unconsiously on foam and blood that was in his mouth . Several minutes afterwards he could not talk and did not know what was going on . His speech was like that of a stroke victim . Finally he was able to speak but then did not know where he was or what day it was . The paramedics and fire dept were there by then . All of his blood tests , ekg , blood pressure and blood sugar tests perfomed while in the ER were perfectly normal , we were told it was the Zantrex - 3 . . Please protect your loved ones and do not take a chance with your life over this product . God bless .
 This stuff is horrible ... I took it for about 3 weeks and could n't take the side effects anymore . The dizziness , the pounding heart -LRB- felt like I was having a heart attack -RRB- , the floating/trippy feeling , unable to sleep ... and when you stop taking it for a day or two , you get a 24/7 pounding headache . I stopped taking the medicine about a week ago , and I am still getting dizzy spells randomly . HORRIBLE !! I would NEVER recommend this to anyone .
 I bought the product at GNC . They explained it was one of the most popular weight loss products they have ... and guaranteed that it worked ! After a week , I gained weight ! My stomach and waistline had ballooned . I think I experienced water weight gain from taking the pill and even my face got fat ! I stopped taking it and just decided to diet/excercise . 565 % weight loss ? not for me ... and you should return your bottle too .
 DO NOT ... DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCTIt has given me the worst headaches , and has given ME A RASH !!! i have taken diet pills before , but THIS BLOWS YOUR STOMACH AND YOUR HEAD.I HAVE NEVER HAD HEADACHES THIS INTENSE , NOR STOMACH ACHES THIS BAD.I do not want to lose weight this bad .
 This drug makes me extremely nauseated . I took it about 5 hours ago and I 'm still shaky and it 's a really odd feeling , hard to describe . It did give me energy , but I 'd rather have a few cups of coffee than experience this weird sick to my stomach feeling . I even took it on a full stomach ! Do n't waste your money .
 this does not work it made me so sick i took it everyday for a week with food and it made me so light headed and jittery it was a werid felling something i had never felt before so i stopped taking them and threw them it the trash DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!!!
 After seeing my best friend rapidly lose 15 pounds in a week and a half , I asked her secret and she told me Zantrex . Mind you , I was already on Tight ! Which is great , but I was being greedy and wanted to lose weight faster . I started taking the recommended dosage a day and my heart was palpitating like CRAZY ; To the point that while I was CASUALLY walking , I had to stop and hold my chest . -- a HUGE red flag . I suddenly knew why she lost weight -- it was because of the nausea . I felt nauseous almost all the time on Zantrex . I could not look at food without feeling like crap and whenever I did indeed eat , I felt even worse . Did I lose weight ? YES ! I lost 17 pounds in two weeks , but , it 's not worth feeling like your heart is about to explode .
 This did not work nor did it give me any energy . All it did was keep me up . My eyes were weary and my body was tired but I just couldnt fall asleep . Didnt have much energy to do anything else . This is nothing like the Zantrex 3 I tried years ago .
 I am 19 years old and I tried this product about six months ago . I have natural curves , but I wanted to lose some extra weight on top of my abs , on my obliques , and on my thighs . I started with just one pill before breakfast and one before lunch . I was eating fairly healthy and doing light exercise , and still I hardly saw any results . They made me feel nervous and at times , very sick to my stomach . I took each one with plenty of water , but I still got very jittery . I had several things happen to me that I was not a fan of.Pros of these pills :1 . Slight weight loss -LRB- Due to water weight - these pills dehydrate you quite a bit . -RRB- Cons of these pills :1 . Skyrocketing heart rate - I felt like my heart was going to beat right out of my chest .2 . Extreme anxiety and paranoia - Sitting in class was very difficult and I felt like I needed to run out of the classroom every time .3 . Lots of sweating - My palms were always sweaty and clammy .4 . Bad breath - I found myself brushing my teeth five or six times a day , and I was still fighting the nasty smell and taste .5 . Loss of sleep - Even when I just took one pill in the morning and one before lunch , my heart rate was much higher than normal , and it kept me from being able to fall asleep . For about a week I was up until four or five in the morning , and I usually try to go to sleep around eleven .6 . Upset stomach - I took these with plenty of water and ate about 15 minutes after taking the pills , and while they curbed most of my appetite , they also made me sick to my stomach several times .7 . MAJOR MOOD SWINGS - One minute I would be happy and bubbly and ready to go , but the next I would be either very sad or even angry . I would get frustrated with the people around me very easily . Little things that people would do just set me off for no reason . I was very angry a lot of the time even though I knew it was irrational.These pills are very dangerous and I do not recommend these for anyone . My roommate found that she had very similar effects to mine , and she stopped taking hers just a few days in . The slight weight loss that these bring is not at all worth the horrible feelings they give you . Read reviews before you ever try anything - if most of them are bad , then the product is probably bad ! Please , please , please do not take these pills .
 This was terrible . Took 2 pills with tons of water before first meal , felt light headed and a little shaky . My day goes on . I decide to take one more capsule , the bottle says you can have up to six . I felt like my stomach was ripping apart inside . My entire body shook , andy husband was convinced I was on cocaine . After hours of the most uncomfortable nausea and shakes I finally managed to sleep . Worst of all I was not smart enoug to think those pills could possibly have had this much of an effect so I took them the next day . Same miserable side effects . Never again . The only way you will lose weight wit this pill is from throwing up or being too cracked out to eat sleep or drink . Spend the $ 20 on a workout DVD instead .
 You will not loose any weight at all . I workout 6 times a week eat right , I am 5 ' 7 140 pounds so as you see I am not overweight either just wanted to speed up loosing 10lb I lost 0 pounds but It did gave me awesome energy , but I must add I forgot to take it 1 day and I had the only migranes felt sick , moody for 3 days straight no pain medication would take the migranes away dont take this wouldd Not recomend this product at all is a waste of money and when you stop using it you will feel awful .
 sick and homicidal all day , then this is the product for you . Tried this stuff to drop a few pounds and found myself sick as a dog , bloated out , and murderously angry . Even my coworkers thought I was on something and I was taking ONE a day ! Does not help lose weight as I was running 20 miles a week and eating less -LRB- probably because I wanted to vomit all the time -RRB- and gained about 5 pounds . Returned to GNC and got my money back.Decided to run three times a week vice five and to try Atkins again and was down nine pounds and four inches in a week . You can keep these so-called `` supplements . ''
 Ugh Do I get my money back seeing bad reviews . N was tld on the box that i didnt have to work out or follow a diet well thats a lie . When i opened the box it said something so different , that u need to work out n follow a diet . They just did that sou would buy it , experincing a uead ach now feels like i wasted money just to lose weight n im not that big . . please work will follow up in two wks .
 I have taken quite a few different types of fat burners and have NEVER had the bad reaction this stuff gave me . When I would take it , yes , it did all the stuff it said -LRB- weight loss I dont know , but I wasnt hungry , had more energy , etc. -RRB- But my face and neck and hands would turn blotchy red and start burning and itching . When the effects of the pills wore off my skin would go back to normal . As horrible as this sounds I thought it was just something my body had to get used to so I continued taking it and it continued to have these crazy effects . WOULD NOT USE AGAIN .
 I tried this product hoping to get that extra boost I needed to shed those last 5 pounds . While I did feel a slight boost of energy , this product did nothing to increase amount of weight I was losing in addition to my already established routine . Although I will say to this product 's credit , I did not feel in the slightest bit ill or sick after taking it .
 Do n't buy it . Just do n't . Suicidal thoughts , depression , anxiety attacks , heart palpitations , panic , and extreme nausea just are n't worth shedding a few pounds .
 I tried these pills despite the bad reviews that I read . Big Mistake ! I started these on the weekend and they made me ridiculously weak . I could not eat anything because I had no appetite whatsoever and had very intense stomach pain . Basically I spent those two days curled up on the couch because I was extremely weak . I almost passed out when I got up to go to the bathroom and my heart was pounding so hard I literally thought I was dieing . These also made me very paranoid and emotional . I lost 2 lbs from not eating but gained it back as soon as I got off the pill . Be smart and use diet , exercise and try drinking herbal teas . DO NOT buy these unless you enjoy throwing your money away .
 I took this product after a friend of mine and I were talking about weight lose methods of the stars -LRB- article she read -RRB- She thought it was an ad . Anyway , I went out and bought some to try . The first dosage as directed at breakfast , within 15 minutes I had rapid heartbeat , my skin felt itchy and red and I had a terrible headache . I took some benedryl for the itch and redness and tylenol for the headache . I felt bad for 2 days . I do NOT recommend .
 I have found another product that I want to recommend . It 's called Alert and is sold by consultants like Avon , but you can also go the Starlight website and order it . It 's a nutritional supplement and for me does provide energy without the jitters , and as a bonus I do n't feel hungry when I 'm using it . They also have a product specifically for weight loss . I have tried that as well . I did feel a bit jittery at first ... but it settled after a week or so of taking it . I would recommend it also . I used it a few years ago and lost 35 lbs . I did consistent diet and exercise which obviously is what did the weight loss , but I credit the supplement with giving me the energy to get moving and helping me curb cravings.I 'm now looking for energy and help maintaining that weightless so for me the alert does both of what I need ... energy and hunger control and it 's less expensive than the weight loss supplement so I now use it . I 've used this for years and have not had any problems .
 I 've tried this product with diet and excercise and it did n't do nothing at all , as all the products from this manufacturer , does n't work ! do n't waste your money !
 Really did n't do anything for me . Maybe I need to invest more time but I really like stuff that at least makes me feel like it is working and does n't just give me a little bellyache .
 I purchased this product from Walgrens and tried becase i was deperate to lose weight . It gave me heart palpitations so bad i thought i was having a heart attack .
 I had the same experience as several other people when taking zantrex - I gained two lbs . and felt TERRIBLE - wired but tired - so I switched back to slim quick , lost the two lbs. , and feel fine ... do n't waste your money ...
 The reason I tried Zantrex 3 is actually kind of embarrasing . I , um , well Screech on Celebrity Fit Club said he used it . Apparently he was a lazy slob who would n't lose any weight , so when he lost something like 5 lbs , everyone applauded him until he revealed he lost the weight by using Zantrex 3 . Some washed up fat reality star endorsed it , so I go spend 20 bucks . Do n't make fun of me.So I give it a whirl . I 'm not trying to lose anything major , but my diet of hot wings and whiskey has caught up with me , and I do n't look so hot in a 2 piece anymore . Worst case scenario , I thought , is it does n't work . I blow 20 dollars on sugar pills when I 've known all along the best way to lose weight is to eat better and move around . Wrong ! Worst case scenario is explosive diarrhea -LRB- I 'm not kidding -RRB- , having my stomach hurt all day , unbearable nausea , head aches , light headedness , dizziness , depression and all kinds of mood swings I could have never anticipated . At first I did n't know what was going on . Why am I dizzy and sad all day with an unbearable stomach ache ? It never occured to me that Zantrax could be responsible for all of this , but I stopped taking it just to see what happened . I felt better the next day which , by the way , seemed to take forever to come because it 's impossible to sleep while on Zantrex.So now everything is fine , I feel like myself again , meals are n't going through me like Taco Bell , I do n't feel like jumping off a bridge , but I still have a gut so I start the Zantrex regimen again . Same thing happened . I was n't convinced that these evil blue pills were the cause , but nothing else in my life had changed . Everything else was a constant . So I do this on and off thing for a while before I just give up on these damned things altogether . If Zantrex 3 is n't what 's causing this raw misery in my life , then by whatever bizarre coincidence , every time I use it , I feel the sincere urge to kill myself.I did n't lose any weight , perhaps because I did n't use it consistently enough . Maybe using the entire bottle uninterrupted would have produced the desired results , but who cares if it causes weight loss or not if the entire time you 're using it , you 're plagued by restlessness , depression , diarrhea , nausea and general lethargy.My new plan goes something like this
 an extra push . I did n't see it as a helpful dietary supplement . I was mostly hyper all day , with no weight loss.Earlier this month , I was preparing to move and I needed more energy , I took two blue Zantrex-3 pills and I was up for at least 24 hours . But when I came down , I basically crashed.During the two weeks I took the pills I did not see any weight loss results , but around 7pm at night , I would feel jittery , like I wanted to crawl out of my skin . In addition , my coworkers thought I was on illegal drugs because I was so wired.I decided to stop taking the capsules and have just been trying to fight the battle of the bulge with diet and exercise .
 Not only did i get sick , have nausea whenever I took it , but also the tension headaches were draining . It causes nausea , headaches and attitudes -LRB- how can anyone feel pleasant on this ? -RRB- Any recommendations for something that really works without making you miserable ?
 While I was taking this I was sweaty , sleepless , cranky , and shaky . I had cheast pains and heart palpitations . And the crash is terrible . However I did loose 20lbs of water weight in 2 days . I loved that i lost weight so fast but it 's sooo unsafe and unhealthy . Do n't risk it .
 And I am not just talking about weight loss products . I took one pill ... ONE PILL ! Within a few minutes , I was curled up around the toilet crying because I needed to throw up so badly but I could n't . I had n't drunk anything but one glass of water with it , and yet , I was peeing all day . I was nauseus ... my fiancee stayed home with me all day to take care of me . I did n't want to move , but I would have to go to the bathroom to pee , and would carry around a trash can with me just in case I finally could throw up . I would not wish these symptoms on ANYONE , not even my worst enemy . That was probably the worst sickness I have ever had .
 I work out 6 times a in a week and eat 5 smal meals a day . I have a very good work out plan and was looking for alittle extra to help me shed more weight . . Zantrex3 is not the answer you are looking for . Do n't bother with buying this product . I looking for anothe supplement , If anyone has any good ones please let me know because this on is n't even worth it DON `` T BOTHER !!!
 I had high hopes based on previous reviews . I took half the recommended dose , solely because I never take stuff like this and was n't sure how my body would respond . It did n't give me energy , it just made me jittery and hungry . Shipping was fast , I just did n't like the product all that much .
 fior me personally , this product was ineffective and unhealthy . The only thing it did for me was suppress my hunger at certain times . This product comes with a price physically so be aware of what your getting into . I read the other reviews and thought it would n't happen to me but it did . I had terrible withdrawals from this and I was sick for a week with severe constipation -LRB- sorry for the weak stomached -RRB- . Try at your own risk .
 I was really looking forward to trying this product . I was not aiming for weight loss so much as a good energy boost while tackling a new job search . I have to say that this was the least impressive formula I have ever tried ! I did n't notice any difference when taking one pill , so I tried to increase to 2 pills as directed , but every time I take two I break out within about 10-15 mins in this AWFUL , terribly itchy bright red rash . Never had this problem with any other similar product . To be fair , it does warn that this could occur on the bottle -LRB- a niacin-sensitivity reaction -RRB- but in my humble opinion it makes light of a really unpleasant situation !! It says it may cause temporary side effects which `` should subside in a matter of minutes '' . Yes , this is true , but oh my goodness , for those 30 minutes it makes you feel like your skin is crawling with biting fire ants ! I am sorry to be dramatic but I just had my third -LRB- and final -RRB- one of these episodes and it really is awful . And while the stinging and burning feeling does subside after 30 minutes or so the bright red sunburn look is much slower to fade . I tried spacing the dose out to see if that might help and I tried drinking with extra water , but it happens every time with the 2 pill dose , and for me , one pill does n't do anything at all in the way of providing me energy . Therefore , I really ca n't recommend this .
 I took this product this morning because I was looking for an energy boost . Bad idea ! Even with taking the recommended amount of water , it gave me a terrible headache that lasted most of the day . This product also makes my stomach hurt REALLY bad !! I also ca n't sleep on this product ... at all . Do not take if you are sensitive to caffeine ! I only took 2 pills this morning ... over 17 hours ago and I ca n't sleep .
 I 'm a relatively healthy person , I workout about 5-6 times a week , eat healthy and drink at least a gallon and a half of water day -LRB- not because of the pills , I 've always drank plenty of water -RRB- . I do n't drink coffee or soda , so I do n't really get much caffeine in my system . I assumed since I take pretty good care of myself these pills would n't make me feel sick . Boy was I wrong . The first day I took them before my workout and had a mild stomach ache that only lasted about five minutes . On day two I took a couple 15 minutes before eating like the bottle suggested . Things were okay until after I 'd finished my lunch . I felt so sick that I ran to the bathroom and immediately threw up my entire meal . I was in so much pain I could n't even leave the bathroom . My husband had to come and bring me a tall glass of water while I sat in fetal position waiting for the stomach pain to go away . I was soaked in sweat , my whole body was shaking and I was in such intense pain that I swore I 'd never take the pills again - and all this happened in just five minutes . I sat there until the pain went away and the shaking stopped , and for the rest of the day I could n't even eat . If these pills actually do work it 's probably because they make you so sick . I 'll just stick to diet and exercise from now on .
 Not much to say about this product except that it made me sick . The first couple days I felt nothing from taking the product and then I started feeling sick every time I took it . Maybe it will work for you but for me it was a waste of money and almost sent me to the hospitial .
 This pill made me SO anxious , and horny ALL day ! I also was not able to sleep . I had nothing to do in the middle of the night but I could not fall a sleep . I was horny without having my bf around . It was a torture . I ended up eating food around like 4am because I was so bored and could n't sleep .
 I used to take Hydroxy once in a while to drop a couple of pounds . I run , exercise and eat low cal . I am 5 ' 5 '' and used to weight 125lbs . I wanted to drop 5 for summer and instead gained 5lbs in three days on this pill.Don ' t take it . I am bloated and feeling gross
 This is scary stuff , I took the recommended dose and felt dizzy , super shaky and like I was going to black out . I was afraid to be alone in case something happened to me . The weird thing is it took about 3 hours to affect me . I dumped the whole bottle in the trash . This is nothing but pure speed . Too risky in my opinion .
 Tried 4-5 so far.They cut very badly , worst by far comapre to the one available in the stores .
 This new `` Lemon Fresh '' Comet does n't hold a candle to the original Comet . It does n't clean scratches from the kitchen sink , for instance , without a LOT elbow grease . I do n't believe the formula is the same as the Comet that comes in the green can . The new closeable lid does n't work . When you close it the accumulated powder poofs out into the air . I prefer the old tape that you placed over the holes in the can when you were finished . My Safeway Store is no longer carrying the original Comet in the green container . What 's up ?
 After two weeks , the massager stopped working . I even replaced the batteries but it would no longer turn on . I had to return the product for a refund.Also , the battery comparment easily falls out of its slot in the cushion whenever the cushion is moved and often sticks into your back.The memory foam flattens out and does n't really offer the support I needed or expected , far less support than a normal pillow .
 The foam was not study enough to support my 180lbs ; after sitting with it for just a few moments , the massage nodes began poking into my back , the battery pack the same . The foam needs to be firmer .
 I did n't like this one it was too small . Did cover the whole back .
 Massage useless To small and not strong enough for heavy people
 after using this product for a while it lost its shape , the massage is a joke feature . do n't buy !!!!!
 This cushion was not worth the money that I paid for it . It does not provider the lumbar support that it advertises .
 It Oscillated nicely for awhile . Now it just gets stuck on whatever setting it 's put on . Bummer . I need to buy one of those small round ones and I think it will do a better job just to have to move it around the yard . I wo n't be buying this brand again .
 This sprinkler lasted under 1 year . I probably used it 60-90 days in that time . When it was n't being used , I stored in in a garage -LRB- so it was n't in the sun -RRB- . The problems are :1 -RRB- One of the nozzles stopped working fairly quickly . This was n't a big deal , but did seem odd . It was just plugged up I guess .2 -RRB- The oscillation became uneven . When I set the sprinkler on full range , it would go a lot farther in one direction than the other . I 'd say that the short side was 40 degrees less than the long side . If I tried to correct this by setting it more on the side that was n't getting full coverage , I would lose coverage on the other side .3 -RRB- A ` sticky spot ' developed where sometimes the sprinkler would get caught for a second then jump across 10-15 degrees . This happened in the same spot , so it might have been a piece of debris or something on the cardioid track .4 -RRB- It began to leak pretty badly at the hose connector.I probably could have fixed problems 1 and 3 , but the totality of the problems made it not worthwhile .
 Bought two of these and both snapped within weeks . Total waste of money . They 're impossible to adjust too . There is a guide but the guide seems to be incredibly inaccurate . We just had to keep turning it and trying it over and over , getting rather wet and irritated .
 If all you want is a cheap sprinkler for the kids to run through , this is a pretty good bargain -- if you get it for $ 10 or less . If you want a sprinkler that you can adjust to hit a certain area , this ai n't it ! The markings on the dial are fairly cryptic , plus there 's no clear identification of what each icon is supposed to line up with . There are no instructions on or in the box , or online . I thought I could figure it out with a little experimentation , but there does n't seem to be a lot of finesse to the system.Like I said , keep looking .
 The sprinkler worked great for a month , then the hose connection broke clean off after moving it normally . It was made of cheap thin plastic where it should have had more support . Guess I 'll spend the money and get something that will last .
 I have another plastic sprinkler by another company that has lasted over two seasons , however , this plastic sprinkler broke at the point where the intake coupling attaches to the body of the sprinkler . Cheap . Would n't buy this again .
 Getting ready to return this one , as it has yet to move an iota . The instructions are nonexistant , the iconography confusing , and everything but the highly-touted brass nozzles is made of paper-thin plastic . Is it so hard to make a sprinkler that waves back and forth ... without fail ? That used to be the norm , not the exception .
 At the beginning , we like it very much for its design . However , it got broken after being used for one week . The plastic parts are very delicate .
 Difficult to adjust . Unreliable . Swings to one side and sometimes gets stuck there . Made a big puddle and damaged part of my newly seeded lawn . Too much trouble to bring back but will not buy another of this make .
 Bought two . ` Wish I 'd bought none . - One snapped apart at its hose connector within two weeks . It has a very weak , non-durable plastic connector so you have to treat these Very Gently -- not how I 'm accustomed to treating gardening tools . - I 'm not very happy with the patterns it sprays , but ... I do n't expect the remaining unit to last long enough for this to matter.Just do yourself a favor and find another product !
 I bought this same one from WalMart and lasted about a month and would get stuck half way through the oscillation every time . It would have been a good sprinkler if it had continued to work . This falls into the seemingly growing list of worst garbage I 've ever bought .
 It is very difficult to adjust the coverage area to exactly what you want . The image on the unit only only gives you an idea , it is not possible to adjust the oscillating angle on one side without changing the other side , and the maximum oscillating angle available when you have it on full coverage is not available if you only want partial coverage . I have spent close to half an hour each time trying to adjust it , and result is only partially satisfactory .
 These are very poorly constructed . Maybe it 's the hot TX sun , but all five I purchased broke within just a few uses . The plastic is cheap and split apart or broken . Not abused as I set them up and left them . Used no more than 10 times each . May be good in a cooler climate , but definitely not a product for use in the hot sun .
 This sprinkler worked well for two weeks , giving a nice even flow of water . After that , the plastic connector piece to the hose broke off . Based on this experience , I would not buy it again . If you do buy it , be careful with the connection to the hose .
 Good Qualities
 The point where the hose connects to the device snapped twice . Sure it is the cheapest one , but why have brass nozzles like it is going to last ? One of which ended up clogging . Before the hose junction snapped , it started spraying where the outlet bar connects . Pass on it .
 Item is really bad quality . It is hard and does not expand at all . The internal surface is very rough and irritates skin easily.I had to through it out after the first use.Stay away .
 Items are awful used and quality very badcompany not responsible for returneven product is broken.Don ' t recommended stay away .
 The product was n't what we ordered . we received covidien brand which didn ' fit ' Cocidien took over from kendall , but the product did n't work out . WE HAVE RECEIVED A REFUND , and are happy now with the way the refund was handled
 I purchased these for my mom . She was intending to order socks that had a closed toe . Because she had no idea what `` inspection toe '' meant in the description , and one of the images showed a sock which does have a closed toe , she assumed it was the right product and I ordered it for her . When they arrived with a toe opening , I contacted the seller to return them . Not only do I have to pay for shipping but I also incur a 20 percent restocking fee ! Essentially , I am only getting half of a refund all because the item description is not very clear . I noticed a few other reviews that say they had the same problem .
 In Japan , Amino Vital Pro is about three times as expensive , so I got this from the USA . The ingredients are stated as the same , yet the flavour is completely different . Furthermore , the Japanese one really seems to have an effect when I work out , whereas this one does not . It might have some electrolytic effect , but it seems to be a different product despite the recipe being the same .
 I bought a bottle of Hoodoba 750 mg a year ago , I wanted to loose weight before my wedding , these pills worked so good , I had no desire to eat I always felt full , it was a miracle . This year in October I bought the 3 bottle package and half way through my second bottle I was not noticing a change in my appetite . I contacted strictly health and I explained to them my situation and I received an email from a representative telling me ' `` This appears to happen every one in every thousand situations where the body seems to reset itself '' . ARE YOU KIDDING ME ???? I only took this product one time a year ago , how can my body reset itself ? He recommended for me to `` Try doubling the dosage from what you took last time . Do this for at least one week straight or until the saturation point is reached which would then allow it to kick in for you . '' THIS WOULD MEAN I WOULD BE TAKING TWELVE OF THESE PILLS ... . Of course at $ 60 a bottle it is clear that I was going to need to buy more which was in his best interest not mine ... . Well it 's been two weeks already and nothing has been done for me . I will not stop until I get a full refund . It 's too bad the pills did not work this time all I honestly wanted was for them to work ...
 I 've tried so many different brands and kinds of Hoodia , and it 's NEVER done anything at all for me ! It does not curb my appetite at all , in fact , it 's like I never even took a pill at all ! So many reviews have said , `` it has to be real authentic hoodia , or it has to be the expensive brand , not the cheap version , or it has to be P57 , '' well NONE of it works because I 've tried them all ... down to P57 , Desert Burn , and now Hoodoba -LRB- which was VERY expensive but I thought it would work , so I spent it ! -RRB- I wish that it did work , but unfortunately it does n't .
 a friend took this product to his lab , all he found was saw dust and some things green we dont know what was . so do n't wast your money .
 I 've never had much luck with Aleve , but I generally only take pain medication for migraines , and Aleve has been pretty useless for those . A double dose of Ibuprofen is the only thing I have found to help . I am just one person though , so you should try it for yourself .
 This is one of my favorite type of shavers but this one broke after light use . They are hard to find but I wish they lasted longer .
 The SF-3 , which has a single-head cutter , is OK for light beards , but not for heavy or 2-day beards , and I found the trimmer to be almost useless for cutting longer hairs . The older models , eg , SM3 2700 , have a 3-head cutter and a 2-position trimmer that could be used by itself for sideburns and longer stray hairs , or in conjunction with the cutter , which is very effective in shaving , say , a heavy beard or a beard of 2 days growth . Of course , the older models are more expensive to manufacture . It is unfortunate that corporations are willing to make inferior products to maximize profits . Such is life in a faltering economy ...
 The item shown is not what is sent . There is some kind of product name SNAFU because the item shipped is a strap-on harness not the bed bondage strap shown . Apparently , both products have the same name . I returned the incorrect items . Waiting to see what shows up in return . Obviously , if time is an issue , you may want to spend the couple of extra dollars and buy this product elsewhere until they get this thing straightened out .
 When I started taking it , I thought everything was going ok , but I would get so exhausted day after day . My back ached all the time , I got headaches all the time and then ... It made me start my period on CD22 . I had very high hopes for this month since my HSG test came back with great results . Per my OBGYN , I stopped taking it and I 'm just sticking with my Pregnitude that she recommended from the beginning .
 I took this for 6 months and my period stop for six months . I can not wait for another month because its abnormal . I took Norethindrone prescribed by my OB-GYN and my period came back . This product is not for real it will do you harm than good . I thought it will normalize my menstruation but its the opposite . If a woman does n't menstruate for long months it would lead to endometriosis or ovarian cancer . I do n't want this to happen to anyone buying this pill that is not approved by FDA . If it is effective , why until now it has n't been approved by FDA ?!!!!! I wasted my money of this and it endangers my life .
 I read a good number of the reviews before I decided to try Fertilaid . I thought it was worth a shot but I got pretty sick from this stuff . I started feeling a little different after a couple of days , just would sweat more than usual but did not think this was a big deal . Anyway after a week I had problems . Now I will admit , the morning I had a spell , I did take it on an empty stomach so perhaps that was my problem . I was a work and my vision went blurry and I got kind of disoriented and a little dizzy . I felt awful and had to have a coworker drive me home . After a few hours of feeling rotten , I started to feel normal but then had a splitting headache . Now , I am somewhat sensitive to some medications but `` dummy me '' thought that since this product was herbal that I may not have a problem . I just wanted to warn people who may be sensitive to medications that this may not be for them . I am sure it could be good for people who never have any issues for medications but I just wanted to let people know of my experience.Good luck with trying and baby dust to you all!P.S . - The reason I gave it 2 stars is that Amazon did a great job of getting it delivered fast . This does not have to do with the product . I am not a fair judge of that since I gave up on it .
 I purchased this and used it for two months . No positive results . I also used fertile cm , it worked for the first three days but no results since then . None of these products actually helped us . TTC over a year now .
 I took this for one month and immediately it prolonged my cycle to 35-39 days instead of my usual 32 days . I always ovulate but since taking this supplement I have not ovulated in 2 months . On to other options , Good Luck .
 I really hope that this stuff works and that it is not just a fake . If anyone can write back to me and let me know for sure . I hope to get pregnant this month . . But , knowing my luck it will not work . I 've been so sad that i have not been able to be a parent . Please God i hope this works . Will keep everyone updated . Will let you know hopefully bu October 10th of 2012 . Only trying one month worth .
 I never bought this from Amazon and I never write reviews but I just wanted to warn people ... I wish I would have looked more into this product before taking it . I 'm sure it works for other people but it was the opposite for me . While I was on it I had 3 cycles that were 36 days and I would still bleed but I never ovulated once . I know I never ovulated because I take my BBT and my OPKs were always negative . I then switched to prenatal vitamins and I am ovulating again ! I am in my first cycle without FertilAid and my cycle is still not right but at least I ovulated . I did n't ovulate until CD 39 this cycle and my cycles are usually 33 days . Now I know to do more research on a product that is going into my body , even if it is just herbs and vitamins ; It would have saved me some heartache and I would n't be out 3 cycles . Hopefully my cycles will be back to normal next month!UPDATE
 BE AWARE OF POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS!I have talked to the makers of FertilAid several times about what their product did to me and they just act like I 'm an idiot . They pretend FertilAid does not harm cycles . They act as if the suffering my husband and I have gone through is nothing , they refuse to edit their info to add a warning label to their products , and they refuse to remove the words `` FertilAid has no side effects '' . They are liars and they do not care whatsoever about the harm they cause . FertilAid has caused INFERTILITY . People need to be aware of this.When reading through this , please note
 I had high hopes for this product , but I have to join in with those who said it threw their cycle into a tailspin . My husband had motility issues , but for good measure I thought I would take these supplements while we were TTC . I was regular and took this supplement for about three months before my cycle completely seemed to stop . I was very excited because I thought I was pregnant , but no . When I told my doctor that I had missed my period twice with negative results on pregnancy tests , she said to stop taking the supplements immediately , but I still missed my period for two more months . What 's in that stuff ?! I ca n't personally recommend this to others based on my experience . : - -LRB-
 I decided to order Fertilaid and bought three bottles -LRB- three months -RRB- worth . My cycles can be very long , so I was hoping that Fertilaid would help me regulate my cycles and ovulate earlier -LRB- I 've had a cycle that was 124 days !!! -RRB- . I decided to order it amongst the good reviews I saw on the Fertility Friend community circle.I took it for 55 days with no regulation of my period . I have n't even really felt different taking it , or felt like it was doing anything worthwhile to me . I 'm on cycle day 58 now -LRB- started Fertilaid on cycle day 3 and stopped on cycle day 57 -RRB- . My prior cycle was only 47 days , so Fertilaid is n't really helping me all that much for having shorter cycles.I 'm going back onto my regular prenatal vitamins in hopes that my cycle will become `` normal '' . I hate to make this a low review , as I had high hopes that it would help regulate my cycles and assist with TTC . I really should n't have to spend loads of money on each bottle for it to take many months to actually do anything for me.I plan on trying some other ways of assisting with regulating my cycles . I hope anyone who takes this sees their cycles improve . Baby dust to all .
 I have PCOS and have been TTC for almost 4 years now . I have been to a fertility doctor and stopped going right before starting shots . My body did not respond to clomid . I have very irregular periods about 1 a year on my own . I have lost about 70 pounds and read all the rave reviews on this product so I decided to give it a go . The first month nothing , the second nothing , the third month nothing . The website said allow 3 months so I went and had a blood pregnancy test done just to be sure I was n't and decided to give it 1 more month so 4 months and nothing happened . Please women do not get your hopes up on this one like I did . You nay be sadly lead into believing it will definitely work for you because you are irregular .
 I read tons of reviews on this product both on Amazon and other websites before deciding to try it . Like many of the other women taking this product , I have an irregularly long cycle . The cycle before I started taking this was 38 days long with ovulation around CD 23 . I started FertilAid on CD 1 of my new cycle . I took it 3x day faithfully . About ten days to two weeks into it I started noticing a rash around my chest area . I did n't pay it much attention at first but it started to get worse . The red splotches became darker and more prevalent . I had n't tried anything else new so I did n't think it could be an allergic reaction to anything . So I did some research . Apparently a rash is a common side effect for both red clover and chasteberry -LRB- two major ingredients in FertilAid -RRB- . -LRB- You can see for yourself if you search side effects of FertilAid supplement . -RRB- Ok , so rash aside , I would have overlooked the rash -LRB- despite its unattractiveness -RRB- if I felt like it worked but it did n't . I know it 's taken a few months for it to work for some people and if it had not changed anything for me the first month then I might have been patient and kept on trying for a couple more months to see if it changed anything . But it ended up DELAYING ovulation . I did n't ovulate until CD 30 this cycle , making this cycle 44 days long . If it was n't going to kick in for 3 + months then fine , would n't my cycle have stayed its usual 35ish days ? Why did it take me LONGER to ovulate ?! Needless to say , I 've stopped . It 's been almost two weeks since I 've stopped taking Fertilaid and the rash is still there !
 These vitamins are horrible . I had a regular menstrual cycle and after taking one bottle of these , I have not had a period in 3 months !!! I have taken 2 pregnancy test 2 weeks apart from each other so I know I am not pregnant . I blame these pills for messing up my system.I got pregnant so soon with my first child and had grown impatient that I had not conceived another . I decided to buy these on a whim thinking they would help us conceive sooner.If you are regular save your money and start eating a very healthy diet , exercise , get your rest , and take a really good prenatal vitamin . These do n't even contain calcium which is a vital nutrient in conception . This alone should help your chances of conceiving tremendously ! Also , focus your attention on something else besides trying to conceive . The stress can hurt your chances . If exercise is not enough of a de-stresser for you , add yoga and meditation to your daily routine.I did my own research and am now folowing those rules.If you have irregular periods save your money and take vitex with a good prenatal vitamin instead . After doing some research online it seems the herb most often recommended for fertility is vitex . It may take up to 6 months to take full effect , but it 's totally natural and in the long run is probably much safer than taking a man-made fertility drug.I hope this helps ! Good luck on all of our pregnancy dreams !
 i have been taken this product for 3 months now and im still not prego :-LRB- im gon na try 2 more months of it before i quit . ill let ya know what happens
 I purchased Fertilaid after being on birth control pills for 15 years . Recently married , we decided to start trying to conceive . I was not sure what my cycle would be like off of birth control , so I thought why not try to regulate things right off the bat ? I read all the great reviews about it and decided I would go for it . Big mistake ! I started taking the pills and got my period right away which lasted 13 days !! -LRB- Normally my period was 3 to 4 days -RRB- . I thought okay , maybe this is just the start of these pills `` normalizing '' my cycle who knows ? Well I am still waiting for my period after 45 days now and have taken 2 pregnancy tests . Deff not pregnant . These pills have messed my cycles up and I am so annoyed . I stopped the pills and am still waiting for a period so that I can try to get back on track ! I would not reccomend these vitamins if you are stopping the pill . Wait and see what your body will do on its own !! I feel like I have just wasted time I could have had on to TTC .
 strange ... i just dont think this works . i take vitex / dong quai instead . let 's see how that turns out.i do see that it helps regulate but has anyone had any success in getting pregnant ??? and if so , how long did it take with the use of fertilaid?i am inclined to just trying one more bottle but since i have pcos , maybe it just isnt for me ...
 I generally have a 28 to 30 day cycle . I ovulate anywhere between CD12 and CD15 . I started this product the beginning of my April cycle . My May cycle started a bit unusual ; this was the 1st only cycle after taking product for a month , when I had n't ovulated by CD20 , I stopped taking it . I did not ovulate until CD33 -LRB- almost 2 weeks later -RRB- and wound up with a 45 day cycle . I have not taken it again . Since this cycle , I 've been right back on track . I do n't know if this product is to blame for that whacky cycle , but its the only thing I can figure . If you do ovulate regularly and on your own , I really do n't think this is the fertility blend to use .
 I am sorry I did n't see the reviews about this product making your cycle irregular prior to my purchasing it . I have now been bleeding off and on for a month . I have been trying to conceive for 2.5 years and was willing to try anything . I only took one pill a day too instead of the recommended 3 per day . I would urge anyone who is regular to proceed with caution prior to taking this product .
 I started taking FertilAid to increase our chances of conceiving . Although I had read some negative reviews from women with regular cycles , I chose to take the risk because of all of the stories of successful pregnancies . I chose poorly . This product THREW MY NORMAL 28-DAY CYCLE COMPLETELY OUT OF WHACK ! My cycle was so out of sync -LRB- 1-2 weeks late -RRB- that I thought I must be pregnant . Well , I was n't pregnant . What I was , however , was utterly frustrated . After 3 months I threw in the towel and returned to taking my regular prenatal vitamins.I would HIGHLY DISCOURAGE anyone with a NORMAL CYCLE from taking these supplements . You 'll just waste more time waiting for your body to get back on track .
 I am 30 yrs old and my husband and I have been trying for a while now . I saw this product and the reviews seemed good so I bought it . I 've always had regular cycles and if I 'm late it 's never more then a couple days . After taking this product not only did I not ovulate -LRB- I 've been tracking with OPK 's and BBT -RRB- but I 've completely skipped my last period . That has NEVER happened to me ! There is NO chance I am pregnant either . I saw my doctor and she recommended stopping it and simply taking prenatal vitamins.I am very disappointed .
 Was really excited when I came across this product from baby forums and everything . My husband and I are TTC and I went off the pill in February . Since then my period was kinda screwy the second month off the pill -LRB- 1 week late -RRB- so about 1.5 months ago I decided to buy FertilAid -LRB- bought 3 months worth -RRB- . Could n't hurt , right ? ha ! I have n't gotten a period since I started taking this pill ... Should have gotten it over 3 weeks ago . Although I 've had PMS symptoms pretty much all the time which is super fun ... Definately not pregnant , have had blood tests and all . I 've decided to stop taking this and hope that I get my period back and am going to see if I can return the one unopened bottle for a refund . And yes of course there is the chance that the product is n't what is causing my missing period problem , but I 've never missed a period in my life so I 'm not taking any chances at this point .
 I have always had regular periods and wanted to be pregnant so bad that I disregarded the warnings about excess bleeding that may occur . Well , during the 3 months that I took them , I did n't become pregnant , my periods were still regular and my hair grew really , really long , Lol ! I also seemed to have so much extra energy while taking them . In month 4 -LRB- my 1st month being off the pills -RRB- my period lasted for 2 weeks . It finally stopped for 2 days and I came back on for another week and a half . For the next 6 months , I bled extremely heavy for at least 25 days off and on every month . I went months without sex because my periods were so irregular now and never completely stopped . I was miserable -LRB- actually depressed -RRB- and just wanted it to stop . I was going through a 24 ct package of pads and a 36 ct box of tampons every couple of weeks . My doctor could n't find anything wrong and even said that maybe I was just going through early menopause . That was a year ago and all is well now and periods are regular again but I will never forget the 6 months of hell I went through .
 I tried one bottle for a month , it did n't help with my cycle at all . Donno if I need to try more but according to other reviews , it supposed to work in a few weeks . .
 My hubby and I have been TTY for 2 years , I read reviews on Fertilaid and decided to try it . Started taking the pills yesterday so fingers crossed and prayers said !
 this do not work it work for most ppl and sum ppl it dont yhu will b best 2 save your money and juz go to a foertility doctor
 I have been taking this product for about a month and still nothing . I have been hoping to become pregnant and when I found this product I thought for sure that it would help . After researching the product I finally ordered it and now I am still playing the waiting game . I can only hope that it actually starts to work and I become pregnant .
 My husband and I have been ttc for a few months now . I read up on this product and decided to try it . I was really excited that my cycle was normal after only being off the pill for a month and just thought taking Fertilaid would only help us in trying to get pregnant . I started taking this product about a month and a half ago and did not ovulate this month . I thought at first that maybe it was just me , but now after reading all of the other reviews regarding non-ovulation , I now see what the problem is . If this is supposed to `` enhance '' your fertility , it should definitely not make it so that you do n't ovulate . I bought another month of it a couple of weeks ago , and let me tell you , it 's going right in the garbage . I really wish I had known about this problem before I went ahead and wasted my time and money on it . I just hope that it does n't take long for me to get back on track and start ovulating again . How long has it taken everyone else to be `` normal '' again ??
 We have been trying to conceive for one year now . Over the summer I bought FertilAid after reading all of the positive reviews . I have always had an irregular cycle . I started taking FertilAid in hopes that I would have a more regular cycle and I had just the opposite happen . After taking the FertilAid for 3 months I still had no signs of AF . After one more month I went to the OB/GYN who recommended I go to a RE and then prescribed me Provera to induce my AF . FertilAid did nothing for my cycle and actually made it worse -LRB- which I did n't think was possible -RRB- . Do n't waste your money or time on this product .
 I did not pay attention on the negative feedbacks of this item . I regret I did not . Trust me , you will suffer from this vitamin or whatever it is . My period is late 8 days and all those eight days I have a terrible pain in my female area I can not even hold myself without analgesics . Please , listen to my review , this medicine is not helping , it destroys the body . I do not know if I will be able to recover from this . I do not know if I got any sickness such as cancer or fibrosis , because 8 days late for the period is too much for me and this Friday I am going to the gynecologist .
 I am a huge review reader . If I dont like the reviews , I dont buy . I took a chance on this and bought the male & female pack . My husband and I have been trying for a year and I thought before we started expensive treatments , that I would try this first . I took it for a month . The only thing it gave me was acne , a jacked up cycle and 10 extra pounds on my ass ! Do you know how it feels to be 8 days late when you 're trying to have a baby only to get your period on that 8th day ? Let me tell you ... IT SUCKS !!! I have NEVER been late . I am always 28 days to the day . Now , my second month of not taking these stupid pills , I am going on 2 weeks late and I know I 'm not pregnant because I already took a test . Which , obiviously , was negative.So thanks a lot Fertilaid for the awesome weight gain and acne NOT associated with pregnancy ... just your crapy pills !
 ok so about 12 days ago i started taking fertilaid and immediately i felt energized and ready to go and a little more healthy . the downside is at the same time it gave me the jitters and made me so jumpy i couldnt stand to sit still ... then about two days into taking it i started getting headaches at night ... and my stomache started hurting whenever i wouldnt eat ... i would love to think that these are symptoms of a possible pregnancy because i am almost two weeks late at this point . however i tested and got a big fat negative so far . i think the side effects were due to starting immediately with the entire daily dose of three pills . i have not used it for two days and i think i am going to go ahead and continue the bottle since apparently i am not pregnant yet . i 'll give it until the end of the bottle because even though the symptoms are annoying they are bearable ... it forced me to make time for split up meals during the day to feel less nauseus and i would take advil to ease the headaches if they would get unbearable when it got that bad -LRB- which it normally did n't -RRB- . so so far no bfp and to reaccount my case me and my fiance have been ttc for over a year and a half with no birth control with one possible but not confirmed miscarriage in that time period . i have very irregular periods and i dont always ovulate . i am going to continue taking it like i said until the bottle runs out or i get a positive test . either way i 'll let people know on here
 After trying to get pregnant for 5 months -LRB- my first child took 2 -RRB- I got impatient and decided to give Fertilaid a try . I had completely normal cycles before and was ovulating every month -LRB- I have the Clear Blue Easy Ovulation monitor -RRB- . Three months into using fertilaid and although my cycle is about the same , I have n't ovulated in 2 months ! I should have believed the people who said that if your cycles were normal that you shoudl n't use it . I am so bummed about the time and money that I have wasted on this !
 I 've read reviews that said you should not take this product if you are regular . I should have listened ! I didnt even make it through a full bottle of this , before I had to stop using it ! And that is after avid research on the product . I do n't believe that it does n't work for some , but it is definitey not for me ! I started spotting really bad after week 2 . I was regular , every 29 days I came on , but this made me irregular . Im going to see if my body regulates itself and I might try clomid at the end of the year .
 I am 32 and was diagnosed with hypothalamic amenorrhea 4 1/2 years ago . I bought this product after all the glowing reviews and have been using it faithfully for 1 month . I know it may be too early , but I have n't noticed any changes in my body yet , nor have I had a menstrual cycle .
 I believe this product probably has helped many women with IRREGULAR cycles , BUT if you have a regular cycle DO NOT USE !!! I was very regular , ovulating on CD 8/9 until I started taking this product . I have been taking it for almost one month now and I 'm on CD 15 and still no ovulation . -LRB- I use the CBE fertility monitor , I would have 2 high fertility days right before ovulating , I 've had 5 high fertility days now ... -RRB- I believe Fertilaid is the culprit as it is the only thing that has changed . I have stopped taking the pills and hope my next cycle will be back to normal.I only wish I had read the reviews on here before buying !!!! UPDATE
 I too am like some of the other reviewers who were regular before taking this product . If you are regular , PLEASE re-consider before purchasing . I have been taking Fertilaid for about 2 and a half months now and stopped taking it two weeks ago after reading all of the other negative reviews . Today my doctor confirmed that I did not ovulate this month , and I truly feel that this is due to the Fertilaid . I am hopeful that my cycle will return to normal very soon . Good luck to all of you on the TTC journey !
 Save your money ! This product is n't all that its cracked up to be - even thought we 'd really like it to be ! I 'd say that it must help if you have irregular cycles , but if you have regular cycles , like I do , it may not be a good product for you . When I took it last month I did n't even ovulate at all - before I took it I did like clockwork , and then after I took it , I did n't ovulate that month ... coincidence !?!?!!?
 After I started taking this supplement , I stopped having periods all together . My OB/GYN had to put me on progesterone to induce a period after not having one for over 2 months . While it may just be coincidental , I would not recommend using this supplement to anyone !!!
 FertilAid for Women
 i am 25 and been ttc for 8 yrs finally my last hope was fertilaid i had a normal cycle until i took this product !!!! my cycles were 28 and now im cycle day 35 and still no af at first i was sooooo excited that maybe it worked and i was preggo but no instead my heart was broken an my cycle was messed up this was a huge mistake i will never take this product again and i want my money back and af to start this freaaking sucks !!!!!!!!!!! I HATE YOU FERTILAID !!!!!!
 I have to agree with the other reviewers that say not to buy this product if you are regular . I used to ovulate regularly , but I have a short luteal cycle so I thought this product could help me . After taking Fertilaid my cycle became very irregular . I started ovulating very late in the cycle and my luteal cycle got even shorter . I took Fertilaid for 4 months and my cycles were all over the place . As soon as I stopped , my cycle went back to normal and two months after I stopped taking Fertilaid , I got pregnant , despite the fact my luteal cycle is only 8 days . So if you are regular do not buy this product . It was a big waste of my money and time .
 If you have regular periods , do NOT buy this product . I am 34 and have been trying to conceive for 4 months . I have had regular periods and have been ovulating since I stopped taking birth control . I saw the advertisement with the hopes of conceiving quickly and I thought , every little bit helps . Since taking this product for 5 weeks , I have NOT ovulated . I have stopped taking it and hoping for the best next month .
 After trying to conceive for a year , becoming pregnant and then miscarrying , I decided this time around I would try Fertilaid in hopes of speeding the conception process . I experienced GREAT results withFertileCM
 I 'm waiting ??? In stock ... but not send ??? why ??? The products are in stock but have spent many days waiting to be sent ... had never been so slow ... not that half-written ... could please tell me what happens ? thanks
 out of the tribulus products ive tried so far , this is the worst . it did nothing for me even after going thru an entire bottle . all it did for me was make my skin oily and give me mild acne . definitely not the best product in the optimum nutrition family .
 Maybe this would be fine in a smoothing/disguised with lots of other things , but mixed with just water it is terrible . It has a foamy consistency . I can barely gag is down . I have tried 3 different protein powders and this is by far the worse tasting . Ca n't wait to get rid of it .
 It is a Protein mix , that much is true . To describe the flavor as chocolate is a stretch ; if chocolate tasted this bad no-one would eat it.This is full of artificial sweetener and the flavor is artificial too . Will never buy it again .
 I 'm surprised by the positive reviews here . But I guess taste buds will differ . I had read that whey was preferable to soy in protein powder , so I gave this a try in my morning smoothie . I found the taste medicinal -LRB- it has artificial flavoring -RRB- and too sweet -LRB- it has sucralose -RRB- . The aftertaste was unpleasant . It 's back to soy protein powder for me .
 Okay I ran out of my usual protien powder so I thought I would try another supplement and I grabbed this . Really how bad can you make chocolate powdered drink mix , really bad . The smell is sickly sweet slightly chemical , the taste is vile just plain vile . Way to sweet if this is chocolate then it it came from a a better living through chemistry gone wrong . Also it makes sludge even when well blended . It is this thick not quite shake like dare I say liquid . While the product may have benefits in its formulation that make it good for someone training and working out , if you can not consume it then it does you no good though .
 This powder tastes absolutely VILE . I got it because I was on a low carb diet and someone had recommended it , but I do n't know what they were thinking . I drink my protein right after workouts at the gym , so I do n't have the luxury of hiding it 's taste with milk , fruit and ice . I mix it straight with water and it 's disgusting . There are several other brands that have low carb powders which taste great when mixed with water .
 This is the worst tasting protein shake I 've ever had . Ever . I 've tried at least six different varieties . I do n't know who these people are that have the time after their workout to make a nice fruit and protein cocktail from their protein shake , but I 'm not one of them . I tried having this shake once with bites of fresh fruit , and it was still barely edible . It 's low fat , packs a ton of protein , calories are almost all from protein , it 's low sugar , and all that . But , I still want something that 's going into my body to taste good , and this does n't fit the bill at all . I 'm going back to Monster Mass or Muscle Milk .
 I bought the Self Wipe Toilet Aid to help my elderly mother who has arthritis , this item is expensive , and difficult to use . If you use it to just dabble around it 's ok , but if you really need to wipe , forget it . The paper comes off and you end in a real mess .
 Great idea but not good in real life . For person with no ability to bend and limited upper body strength this product did not help at all . The product did not clean enough so that there was still necessary clean up needed . It was also hard to release the paper once he was done .
 Absolute waste of money . The toilet paper does not stay put . Use the Bottom Buddy .
 This is more trouble than it 's worth . Trying to put the paper on the roller and get it to stay where it belongs is work in and of itself.If you want the one that 's the best -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- go for this one : Bottom Buddy Toilet Tissue Holder Helper
 I ordered this hoping to increase my energy and desire to work out . I read reviews of the product at other sites which were mostly positive . I saw some complaints about taste and loss of sleep . But , mostly the reviewers said that they made gains in size and strength . They claimed an increase in sexual potency as well . So here are my opinions.Pros : The taste kind of reminded me of real maple but not sweet.Cons : I did notice some sleep difficulty but it went away if I took it earlier in the evening usually after eating.I did not feel more energetic . I did not have any gains in size or strength . I had no difference in sexual potency.So , it did not work.I gave it two stars only because `` hate '' seems a pretty strong term . The definition of 1 star is `` I hate this product . `` I say spend your money on a good whey protein .
 I have had this product for a year , and really like it , however you can no longer find the replacement odor filters . I called Graco and was told they no longer make them . Of course it works without the filter , but there is a BIG difference in containing the smell ! My other complaint , now that I have a toddler , he loves to open & close this pail and put toys & other items in it !
 This thing is just not good.First , the touch-free part only works if a -RRB- the bin is pretty much completely empty and b -RRB- the batteries are pretty much brand new . Another words ... it rarely ever works.Second , the smell !!!!! Everytime you open it up to throw away a diaper you will be hit with this horrendous smell ... and before you think `` well , you need to change it more '' ... her is our routine . We empty it every 3-4 days . We DO NOT throw poopy diapers in it , we take those out to the garbage in the garage . We change the little filter every month like we are supposed to . We use deoderant garbage bags and spray it down with lysol everytime we change it.So ... it 's not us . It 's the diaper pail . Save you money ... this is a piece of very smelly junk.Get a diaper dekor ... or better yet , just throw your diapers away in your regular garbage . It 's cheaper and your LO will enjoy the `` field trip ''
 We received this as a gift . We took it out of the box and put it together when we were doing our nursery . We tested it a couple of times and it worked fine . Now our baby girl is due anyday and it does n't work . The gears inside are all jammed up so we ca n't even use it manually . We ca n't take it back because we do n't have the box anymore and we received it as a gift so we do n't have a receipt . We are just glad that we received it as a gift -- and not wasted our own money on it.We are very upset that we did n't even get to use it .
 You 'd think that a diaper pail with a power-driven lid would come with an electrical cord , right ? Wrong . This junker requires four D batteries that need to be replaced once or twice EACH WEEK.But wait ; there 's more ! Installing new batteries requires taking off the smelly lid and unscrewing THREE small Phillips-head screws that hold the unwieldy battery cover in place!You could n't come up with a stupider design if you tried .
 I thought this diaper pail was going to be the answer to our diaper disposal issues . We had previously tried a popular diaper pail that did nothing to stop odors . This one does the trick with keeping the room smelling not like a diaper , but lacks in the design area.First of all , it should have been designed to be at least twice as big . We use size 4 diapers , and this pail barely holds two days worth of diapers . If I wanted to change the pail that often , I would use a regular garbage pail.Secondly , when it 's full or the batteries die , the pail is useless . Therefore , you 're left standing there holding a steaming diaper!And finally , the materials used seem flimsy for the amount of use the pail receives.I 'm hoping for an improved version soon !
 We purchased this diaper pail because all descriptions , and even the video on the Graco website made it seem like when you drop the diaper in the pail , it falls directly into the bag and has the filtration system to contain the smell . This is NOT the case . This pail has a similar system as the Diaper Champ , in that there is a `` ball '' that catches the diaper , then it spins and drops it into the chamber below with the bag when the lid closes.We were hoping to use this for cloth diapering , so we were looking for a pail that has a filtration system , but none of the special bags , crimping or chambers that catch the diaper and drop it into the pail . With this method , we 'd have to constantly clean the `` ball '' that catches the cloth diaper , and we just do n't want to deal with that . I guess we 're stuck using a standard garbage can or pail for our cloth diapering . I wish someone would invent a great filtered pail for cloth diapering !
 this thing worked once . ONCE ! After that , the motion senor never worked properly again . So then we just figured we 'd raise and lower the lid manually . Well , because of the gearing for the auto lift , most of the time the lid jams and wo n't go back down after you open it.STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT . Unless you enjoy things that do n't work ... . it 's junk .
 Although this was a great concept , it is n't perfect.Ours broke after just 6 weeks of use . The lid no longer opens and closes . The gears inside stripped from my older child manually opening it once . We have had it more than 30 days , so we ca n't return it and who wants to return a stinky diaper pail?As another reviewer mentioned , the lid has to be taken off and screws undone to replace the 'D ' batteries . This battery cover is a little too close to where the diapers travel through , so it is a really gross process.Our pail will hold about a half of a week of diapers . They should be emptied more often than this anyway.The ball part inside that holds the diaper and then drops it in the trash can gets gross , no matter how hard you try to be careful and contain the mess.And the smell ! It does absolutely nothing for the smell no matter how many of their filters you buy . There is the constant smell leaking from it , but when you open the pail to put in a diaper you just want to go running from the room before the smell overwhelms you.I wish I had saved my money and just bought a trash can .
 We returned one of these right away , because the hands - free option did not work . After exchanging it for a new one , we discovered that it , too , did not work . However , as a parent of a newborn , you just do n't have time to run to Babies R Us all the time for a new diaper pail , so we decided to just use the manual lift option and be done with it.Fast forward 8 months
 And `` junk '' is too nice a word for it . The hands free thing never worked , and the part that flips over for you to put the diaper in when you open the lid does n't come up all the way , so I have to cram the diapers in just to use it . We 've only had it a couple of months too ! A pail that costs this much should work more than two months ! On top of that , those little filters are a joke . This pail stinks worse than any we have owned to date . Fortunately , my son has quit wearing diapers , so we just have our daughter 's to deal with , but still ... this pail is NOT worth the money and we are really upset that we wasted our money on this product .
 We had the diaper champ with our first and I wish I had bought another . The `` touch free '' worked with about as much frequency as those hand dryers in the public restrooms . And the gears inside jammed up everytime the pail got full . -LRB- about 1-2 times a week with 2 kids -RRB- Do n't waste your money with this it 's a piece of crap .
 I was one of those very happy customers with this product until I went to buy the second round of filters -LRB- probably a year and a half ago -RRB- . I thought maybe places were out of them or something and was able to get them via Graco directly . Now I sent them a message this morning via email and got a really bizarre response that if I want to buy any product from them or their sister companies , I can get a $ 20 rebate ? That does n't help me with my diaper pail ! I 'm about to have my second child and am stumped for what type to get now . This was a great product , so why they stopped making them is beyond me - there is NO diaper pail that gets rave reviews across the board , so why stop making this one ? Just shaking my head . Maybe more reviews on amazon will help some poor schmuck from buying one off another site . I always come to amazon for product reviews , so maybe this will help someone .
 My wife is a size 8 and this piece of junk broke the first time she put it on . She never even made it to the bed .
 I was very excited to get this product ! But was very disappointed when a -RRB- . I noticed that the straps are way to small for a normally sized woman b -RRB- it does not stay in place c -RRB- it 's very strong it kind of stings .
 When this arrived it did n't work . Amazon was great about sending another one . When it arrived it did n't work . You could see the wires inside going to the second egg and they looked like they were burned . Might have been from when it was manufactured . Amazon refused to send a third one . Maybe the lot was bad . Anyway , it looked like a great toy , but unfortunately was n't able to find out . I 'm ordering from another site , so we 'll see . Also , it 's huge , so do n't order it if the idea of a large toy scares you !!!
 I really just wanted to use this product while giving my nephew a sponge bath instead of bathing him in the sink . So to test this out I put it on my couch and then put my nephew on it and he kept sliding down it . Thank God I did not put him in this thing in the sink before I tested it out . I just went ahead and bought an infant tub . I dont know what I am going to do with this thing . I know it does not cost much but I think you would do better to buy an infant tub with a sling .
 These `` knock offs RATHER SUCK !! The plastic on mine CRUMBLED !! The REAL BRAUN foil cover head does NOT FIT these copies , either !! SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND GET REAL BRAUN PARTS !!
 It worked for 4 months , then the brittle plastic at the base of each end snapped . I know Braun does n't make them any more , so there are n't a lot of choices . Too bad , especially since they charge so much :--LRB- .
 The plastic that holds the foil broke within 1 month under normal use . This was a waste of money . Save your money do n't buy this product .
 These ear plugs do n't work . I inserted them correctly , but I could still hear the guy next door watching TV and the sound of my cat eating was magnified .
 Please be aware that this tooth powder contains no flouride which is essential to healthy teeth , and , is abrasive to the teeth . Each dental patient who uses this product is experiencing long term tooth and gum damage.My first question is
 This purchase just goes to show that you get what you pay for . Claiming to be a cutter for the 2000 Series Braun shaver , this cutter is too big and obviously not the product described . They also sent me 12 of them . ?? I have contacted the company and we 'll see if they will take care of the issue . To add insult to future buyers it seems they have raised the price since I bought it as well . Caveat Emptor-Let the buyer beware !
 I ordered this stethoscope specifically because the picture shows ONE tube coming from the bell . This one is n't the same . It has two tubes . I guess I 'll have just return it an go get one from somewhere here in town where I can see what I am getting .
 I love my Sennheiser wireless headphones -- except for the battery . This battery rarely lasts more than 2 hours . That 's why I have a charging unit that charges two batteries . Also to keep in mind -- these batteries wear out fast . There 's only so often you can recharge these things before they die completely . If I 'd known how many of these $ 20 batteries I 'd be going though , I would probably have picked a different brand of wireless headset .
 Yeah , this proprietary case is ridiculously expensive . If you are a little bit handy , you can take the case apart using an exacto blade . Pry along the edges , it is plastic welded , but comes apart pretty easy . There are two V80H batteries inside made by Varta . These are 1.2 V Ni-MH cells for a total voltage of 2.4 V . You can buy the batteries inside the case here on amazon for -LSB- ... -RSB- -LRB- 1.2 Volts .08 Ahmps . -RRB- , or from batteryspecialists.com for -LSB- ... -RSB- when you buy 6 . You will have to desolder the tabs from the old batteries and solder the new ones in there . Have fun .
 I just received the battery -LRB- BA 151 -RRB- that Amazon suggested I buy for use with my Sennheiser 140 headphones . The problem ? They do n't even fit or work with the headphones ! I do n't see how people buy these to go along with a product that does n't use them . This is the first time I have gotten bogus information from Amazon and at $ 7.14 they are not worth the bother for paying to have them returned ! Guess I 'll just chalk it up to experience but I 'm not sure how one avoids having tis happen in the future . I have always taken Amazon at their word !!! Strike one ...
 I have ordered a Sennheiser spare battery , but instead I 've received a generic battery with a sticker on it , with which I could not even fit the battery into the charger .
 The batteries I purchased -LRB- 2 -RRB- are not genuine Sennheiser batteries . They only last about one hour on a charge . The original Sennheiser branded battery lasted for several hours , and several years . This is the first replacement battery that I have had to buy in fove or six years . I expected the replacement to be of equal quality to the original , but it is not . In fact , I expected the purchased batteries to be Sennheiser branded batteries , since the Amazon listing said they were ! I think I got ripped off ! -- @ % # ^ % $ * &
 I have read a number of the reviews and am very confused about this battery . . Many stated that they lasted many hours . When the unit requires 2 AA rechargeable batteries ... how could this battery do anything ? I thought that it could fit into the stand ... . I have an old RS 120 that is still working after many years , without a battery change . I opened up the unit , and there is no battery in it . The headphones have 2 AA rechargeable batteries . . Are we being misled by Amazon or Sennheiser ??? When I was ordering the RS 130 , I knew nothing about the batteries , relied on the Amazon display .
 I have bought these replacement batteries before but the ones I received this time both have a life of less than three hours - far too short and shorter than any previous ones I 've had .
 I purchased this battery thinking it would help keep my headphones charged longer than 2 hours . Unfortunately there was something more wrong with the headphones so I needed to purchase new headphones and a charging base .
 You probably wo n't read this until too late BUT ... Consider getting headphones from a manufacturer who is n't going to take you to the cleaners with replacement batteries.These do n't hold much of a charge -LRB- 2ish hours max -RRB- and they wo n't last long -LRB- maybe a year ? -RRB- . The real kicker is $ 20 + for a couple of hearing aid batteries in a goofy proprietary case ? OUCH!I like -LRB- d -RRB- my Sennheiser headphones . Now they sit useless gathering dust . I 'll ebay the headphones before I give Sennheiser any more of my money .
 This is a worthless battery . Has very little battery life less than 90 minutes . This is a cheap imitation of the original battery that lasted about 4 hours per charge .
 unneccessary for the product we bought and that was n't clearly stated in the ad
 After almost four years heavy use with the original battery , AB 151 , powering my wireless HDR 30 earphones , the recent replacement hardly holds a charge . It came with no instructions for precharging , or for the need . I did so at the risk of warranty infringement.Of several sources at lower prices , I chose the unit sold directly by Amazon , I perhaps fell victim to the ` free shipping ' enticement . At $ 25 plus change it was no biggy ... but perhaps of interest to a few remaininggood music afficiandos .
 You DO NOT need this battery . Amazon still has on the 130 Head set picture and the `` Frequently Bought Together '' photo.Well I fell for it and bought the battery . ebattery knows it 's in error but yet people like me fall for it and good luck getting your 8 dollars back .
 These batteries show up everywhere the RS180 headphones are mentioned , but they are n't needed -LRB- nor are they compatible -RRB- with the 180 's . Amazon 's fault , not Stennheiser 's .
 THIS BATTERY IS NOT FOR THE HEADPHONES THAT AMAZON HAD IT PACKAGED WITH . I WAS INTENTIONALLY MISLEAD INTO BELIEVING THAT IT WAS .
 This product is not for the RS 140 phones . Fortunately , Amazon 's return procedure made returning it relatively painless .
 These items were bundled together and I assumed they went together , WRONG ! This is the wrong size battery for this unit . You need a BA300.Granted Amazo was awesome on the return and credit I recieved.But just wanted to give a heads up on the two products together .
 I hate being duped . The listing clearly indicates that this is a Sennheiser product but it is not . My original batteries are at least 6 years old by my recollection . One still works like new and the other is going bad so i ordered a replacement . At this point the 6 + year old OE battery is making a solid 4 hrs where the aftermarket replacement is falling a bit short . I have not done a truly scientific test at this point , but it is definitely less.I 've taken part of the listing that was in place at the time of my order and posted below : Technical DetailsBrand Name
 I 've bought over ten of these in the time I 've used my HDR80 headphones . Brand new , they 'd only last a few hours , and it makes sense because they are just a couple 1.4 v watch batteries stacked together once you crack the shell open.If you buy a headset that uses these , you can count on having to buy these batteries again and again , as they only seem to last for a few months before they get weak and wo n't hold a charge.At least I was able to modify my hdr80 so that I could power it with AAA 's instead . I can enjoy great sound without the tax of buying these overpriced batteries . I 'd avoid any headset that uses these , unless you do n't mind the extra expense and hassle of doing the battery shuffle .
 they did n't send the right item and it 's been hard to get them to respond to emails
 We have had Sennheiser battery 's in our family for 6 years and they are not worth what one can get for a battery . Just look at the improvements on you cell phone battery Li-Ion . What has Sennheiser done for their battery 's ? NOTHING . They have a great product but languish on still making money on a lousey battery . We think they should switch to AAA battery 's and it will be a better deal for all of us . Sony will be our next headphone set that my wife wants for Christmas.RD Varin
 I bought two BA-151 replacement batteries that did n't fit until I removed the labels as the opening in the headphones would not accept the extra thickness . I was disappointed that the battery life in both batteries were about the same but only roughly two hours before needing a recharge . Do n't know if the genuine Sennheiser battery would be any better but past reviews suggest that the short operating time might be typical .
 I bought this in a package deal since there are many times when the rechargable battery does n't have enough power to get through what I trying to do . I assumed that the package was put together by people who knew what they were doing . No Way . There is now way this battery can be used with the Sennheiser headphones that I purchased . I have no idea how to find out what it can be used with.Lesson is ; research the parts of a package before you buy the package .
 When I purchased Sennheiser IS410 Wireless Ultra-lightweight Assistive Listening Stereo Headphone System - the prompt from Amazon for ` customers who bought this &#8230; bought this ' - so I thought it was the battery for the Headphones.It 's not.Worse yet I opened it and then figured out it was the wrong battery.I 'm not happy .
 During Summer 2012 my alergy symptoms were bad . Saw an article that recomended Perilla Oil to help combat alergies . Do n't know whether the product I bought through Amazon was substandard or if the recomendation was off the mark . Just know there was no change in my symptoms while using the product .
 VERY disappointing . This product worked one time , and after that , after doing as the hotspot website instructed to re-use them by microwaving in water for one minute increments , they looked like clear liquid again , but after sitting for a bit , they turned hard as a rock and are not useable anymore . I wasted my money on these . Too bad they do n't work .
 I used these while cycling . I bought 8 pairs -LRB- my mistake , I should have tried one out first -RRB- and got about 4 minutes of heat and then they went cold . I bought them directly off the Hotsnapz website . I have tried calling and emailed the company for 4 months for a return and never get a response . Do not buy .
 I took this for about a month but did not see any difference from it . I was so hopeing that it would help , I would not waste your money on it .
 I 've suffered from chronic pain for almost 20 years from a serious injury , it gets worse when the weather is colder , so I was very hopeful this product would be helpful . I hate taking prescription painkillers because of the side effects , but will keep looking for natural alternatives , this product did n't make any difference in my pain level .
 The Fatigued to Fantastic book was very interesting and had some great advice . I had high hopes for this product , but sadly did not feel any pain relief even when using it exactly as directed in the book .
 After taking it for 3 months , I can tell NO difference in the pain level .
 I 've tried this product as directed and I did not noticed or experienced any difference , so I stoped using this product . I 'm 29 years old and I do n't have any problems in that department , but desided to try this anyway . No results . Sorry .
 Just took my first dose and I am shaking all over almost ready to go to the ERI do n't know whats going on but feeling nervous cold shakey scared.I will never take another one of these pills.It now has been 12 hours and still feel wierd when will this feeling stop grrrrrrrrrr
 Yohimbe ! Bad stuff ! 500 mg in each which means runny sinus ' - insomnia-heart palpitations and general feeling real unstable!Didnt like this stuff at all ! sent it backHOWEVER there is a non-Yohimbe version of this sold on Amazon-no experience with that as of yet .
 This trampoline came with a broken part and the handle of the carrier bag ripped as soon as I took it off the folded trampoline . I emailed the company but received NO RESPONSE . There was also no literature included . The mat on which you bounce seems too small , certainly not 40 '' . The springs show and are not covered by the edging . Wish I had picked another rebounder !!
 I thought I would get a `` single pack '' of severla of these , but literally I got a single one in a giant padded envelope ! The scraper works fine , but I am reeling against the fact that this cost $ 4.15 when my dentist used to give them away for free ! Do n't waste your money .
 I understand that these were from bulk pack but I assumed they would be packaged somehow for sanitary reasons . The two I ordered literally came loose in a mailing envelope . I am completely disgusted . In addition - you can find these cheaper elsewhere in a pre-packaged container of 3 .
 Misleading information . I thought I would receive more than one tongue scraper but instead I only got one . The item was only placed in a plane envelope and not even packaged . Who knows if its been used ! Never will I order from this vendor again . Very pricey for one tongue scraper .
 cant hear a thing ! save your money and get the more expensive one !! very disappointed !!
 Very cheap and does n't work . When you blow into the chestpiece you can hear it , but you ca n't hear a heartbeat or breathing when placed on chest . It 's just not sensitive enough . I bought it as a child 's toy , hoping they could hear their heart , but does n't look like that will be possible . Very disappointed !
 I think the fisher price doctor kit works better and lasted longer . It wo n't even stay together and you ca n't hear a heartbeat . It will work to amplify voice if you talk into it , so my three year old uses it for that .
 my wife bought a pair of yoga toes . I bought these toe-stretchers . the material is rigid and unpleasant to the touch . the yoga toes that my wife purchased are more pliable and comfortable .
 While it would be very helpful to be able to measure body fat percent daily , the methodology of this machine does not work for those taking diuretics . -LRB- Diuretic-taking people are thse high blood pressure who have to be very careful about their weight and body fat . -RRB- Tanita -LRB- the maker -RRB- notes that taking a diuretic will skew results , but their descriptions are unclear as to in which direction . The only advice to diuretic-takers in all of Tanita 's provided liturature and on its website are to always `` take measurements under the same conditions . `` Tanita provides no information as to the reference scales defining `` healthy , '' `` overfat , '' and `` obese '' for someone taking a diuretic . Are these ranges higher or lower for someone on a diuretic than for the `` standard person '' ? By how much?No answer.Under these conditions , this scale is useless .
 I was shopping for a Scale and when I saw this was very impressed as it was a scale and a Body Fat Monitor at a reasonable rate . It does not give you an option to just weigh yourself . It 's very slow and if you have more than 2 persons in your home then it 's frustrating . Thought of returning it but Amazon was to charge me $ 10.0 for shipping . I got it for 20 , so it was not worth returning and now I am stuck with it . I do not belive the bady fat monitor is accurate either .
 Every time I stepped on mine , it gave me a different result . This was both for the fat measuring and the weight.The weight only measures in .5 pound increments , and the fat metrics require you to enter your height and sex and whether you are an adult or child . I do not expect perfect accuracy for fat measurement since it is very hard to measure , but obviously if this info is being used the fat measuring is completely worthless . For anyone who had a different than normal build , basing fat content off simple height and weight is ludicrous - may as well go back to the ideal weight charts of the 40s . It also takes a fair amount of time to enter this info , and it is not possible to my knowledge to just weigh yourself without entering it . If I seem to be ranting , it is recalling the time I spent each morning for a year uselessly entering all this info in.The fat % indicator would jump around between 18 % and 45 % for me , and even stepping off and reweighing myself 5 minutes later would result in weight discrepancies of up to 5 pounds at times . Occasionally it would even say I had under 10 % body fat , which I believe even less than the possibility I have 45 % body fat.When I finally measured myself with a balance it turned out the scale was 10 pounds off on average . Simply pathetic.I eventually got a taylor scale without the fat monitoring , and weighing myself several times in a row always gives me the exact same results , and it seems to honestly be within .2 pounds of the weight I get by using a calibrated balance at the doctor 's office.Overall this has to be one of my worst purchases of all time .
 Neither the package photo nor the description reveal how many milligrams of the active ingredient are in each tablet .
 If you want low calorie ketchup that actually tastes like ketchup , stay away from this product . It tastes more like a vinegar or cocktail sauce than ketchup . If you 're looking to cut calories in the ketchup department , a better option may be Heinz One Carb ketchup -LRB- which , though they do n't tout it , only has 5 cals per serving while regular ketchup has 15 . The buzz on the net is that this stuff actually tastes like original Heinz . I said it with Walden Farms Chocolate Syrup , and I 'll say it again with their ketchup
 It 's a flimsy plastic trimmer that does n't have any good qualities aside from the cheap price tag . You 're better off spending an extra $ 5 on `` MANGROOMER Essential Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer '' here on Amazon . My husband has n't had any complaints with that one so far .
 I had this type of Panasonic trimer for several years . I decided to get a new one , but it was n't working from day one . I got another one . It worked for a few days , and then stopped working . I was surprised that a Panasonic product would be this defective . IF it is working , it works great .
 This thing could not cut a single hair . First we tried the nose , then the ears , then the arm then the twigs and berries ... it was as if the blade was missing ... complete POS ... my old Panasonic device worked well for years ... sad to say this is the first Panasonic product that I have ever bought that has not lived up to the name .
 This product is an embarrassment to the brand.Installed a brand-new Duracell battery in a brand-new trimmer and attempted to trim for a solid two minutes . This effort resulted in no appreciable impact.I specifically and repeatedly targeted a particularly irksome offender , using every conceivable angle of attack , throughout which it stubbornly and valiantly resisted the so-called blade.I should add that while it fails to trim anything , the device does in fact result in sensations that can not be called pleasurable as it pulls on your nose hairs in futility.In case this is not enough to dissuade you from making this purchase , the device also produces an unpleasant and potentially harmful ozone smell .
 I got one of these and the blades would spin for just a bit before the unit stopped even with a fresh battery . Starting and stopping all the time was a pain . It also got hot if I tried to run it long enough to boldly probe where no nostril has been probed before . It did n't cut too well either , leaving plenty of hairs still poking up after multiple passes . Quick learner that I am , I bought another one , just in case . That had all the same faults and also kept coming apart . So much for my reputation as a boy genius . Spare yourself the trouble and get something better .
 The family convinced me it was time to trim my nose hairs , so I purchased this Panasonic personal grooming device . It is compact , runs on a single AA battery , comes apart for cleaning , uses stainless steel blades , and seems safe to use.Unfortunately , it does not cut nose hairs . It vibrates , tickles , and twirls them around , but too often fails to actually trim them off . In addition , the non-replaceable blade is designed to wear out after about two years of use.There must be better products on the market.Note
 I purchased this thing over a year ago from Amazon . You people LIED to me ! I 'm shopping for a replacement ! Seriously though , it has some problems
 The negative reviews are correct . I too had problems with the switch not working and the blades spinning inconsistently . The plastic nozzle that houses the blades is held on with tiny plastic hooks , which eventually broke making my trimmer useless .
 Do n't let the name Panasonic fool you . This is a cheap toy . Mine got slower and slower , fresh batteries made little difference . It did n't even last a year . Spend a little more and get a better one.E.L .
 After searching in the price range of under $ 30 dollars for a nose hair trimmer I realized that they were all going to be battery powered . I decided to go with this little `` bad boy . '' Let me just start by saying that if you are looking to buy this product , you better have three inch nose hairs because this little device is unable to trim my nose hairs . Basically you have two small blades attached to two plastic hooks . The plastic hooks are spun by a plastic notch -LRB- hint
 You should think about using eye-watering tweezers rather than buy this product . I gave up using it after the first few attempts because , amazingly , it does n't cut hair ! You spend 5 minutes trying to align each hair so that it will enter the nozzle at the right angle to cut . Even then , the blades tend to push the hairs out of the way rather than cut them . It even managed to scratch the inside of my nose because I was pushing too hard to make it work . A bit of a design flaw for a hair trimmer !
 It does make noise , but I could not find any cut hairs . Even when I tried to make it cut a specific hair it did not work . In the end I had to get the scissors and tweezer out .
 I was hoping for an alternative to scissors , but no . It does n't really cut very much , it 's so tickly and irritating that I find it unusable . If it did a better job actually trimming I might be willing to put up with the discomfort , but in the end it 's all pain , no gain .
 I 've had this gizmo for many years . It 's far superior to the mechanical unit that I had before that did n't cut at all . This gizmo has worked fine and has never failed . However , it just wo n't cut the hair . I have to buzz and buzz and buzz to get the job done , which really only should take about 5 seconds per nostril .
 This item worked well for a month or so , but then began working intermitently after that . Eventually it stopped working all together . In my opinion it is a pretty cheaply made item . I would not recommend it .
 When it worked , this compact trimmer did a good job . Unfortunately the motor died after a few months . The trimmer first developed problems with starting , where it would take a few taps on the housing to get the motor going . Performance deteriorated until it finally refused to start at all . The motor reminds me of the cheap DC motors used in model planes , that fail after minimal use . Maybe I got a lemon , but this trimmer was a total disappointment . It is cheap , so if it does die , at least you wo n't lose too much .
 This was a handy little thing until I tried to use it after only using it 3 times , and it was just totally dead . I put new batteries in , fiddled with it , took the top piece off and screwed back on tighter , etc. . Nothing would fix it , it 's just dead . I guess that 's what you get when it 's so cheap , but pretty disappointing ...
 Ordered this ear and nose trimmer to replace my panasonic trimmer . Looks like my old panasonic trimmer . Though the speed seems the same as my old trimmer it just doesnt do the same job . For some reason it takes so much longer to get results . I ended up buying a micro touch max made in china at walmart , It works better than any trimmer I ever had and is more versitile .
 I received the trimmer and left the country the next day for an extended period of time . When I opened it up and put in a battery , it did not work . I tried other batteries , with the same result . I ended up throwing it away .
 the worst product ever ! why , you ask ? because it did n't even work ! i put the battery in and it would n't turn on . do n't waste your time with this plastic piece of junk !
 I never got to use the trimmer . The motor does n't work even after buying new batteries , and the cutting head looks like it 's been smashed.It 's not worth the postage or trouble to return it , so it just lays in the drawer .
 I 've purchased 2 of these over the years . It worked to a point but not very efficiently . You can do better and faster with a pair of scissors , if you know what I mean . They are also very fragile , both of mine shattered into pieces from dropping onto the bathroom floor by accident .
 I had this model , or at least it looked the same , for a few years and it worked exceptionally well . It finally broke down recently and I thought I was lucky enough to find it again , but they must have changed the product significantly because it does not work very well at all . Actually , it is virtually useless as it only partially gets the job done , which , of course is like not having it done at all !
 Did not work ! Had to send it back for exchange ! No response yet after two weeks !! Crap crap crap crap crap . Crap crap crap crap
 The price was cheap , but it was a poor quality nose hair trimmer . The nose hair trimmer only lasted two month .
 I purchased my first Panasonic trimmer about 15 years ago . It was solid and did a great job.When it was time to buy another there was no question that I was buying another Panasonic . My mistake ! did n't last 6months .
 It hurts when I used it on my nose hair . It does n't last that long either for the price that I paid because mine is now broken . I bought it within 2 months ago and I barely used it too . I should have bought something else .
 Panasonic is a great brand . When I purchased the nose hair groomer I was a 100 % sure this was my best option based on my experience with panasonic products . However it was not . The groomer yanks the nose hair and the pain is terrible I even cried wow .
 This worked great when new , but performance dropped off significantly . Would not recommend . Would get manual -LCB- not powered -RCB- mechanical replacement .
 I 've had this item for quite some time and keep giving it shot after shot after shot . This does a good job of cleaning out nose hairs , however it cuts the inside of my nose at the same time , leaving me with a blood crusted inside which takes weeks to heal ! It also gets really hot when in use , which makes it even less comfortable !
 I had used my previous Panasonic trimmer for over two years before it was lost with my luggage at the airport . I purchased the same model as a replacement , and as a previous reviewer has stated , the blade design has been changed from the earlier model . What used to be an efficient , quick trimmer has now become a waste of both time and money . Do not buy this model , spend your money on another product .
 Many of the reviews here 2 years and older refer to an earlier verison of this model.Panasonic is now using a less powerful motor and apparently changed the blade design as well . I used to think this was a superior trimmer . Now , it is on par with all the others.I purchased this product about 2 years ago based on all the positive reviews , and I loved it . I will admit it that the only drwaback was that it would very slightly pull hairs if they were too long , but that could be avoided with routine use.My kids recently broke mine . Without hesitation , I reordered from Amazon . I was shocked to discover this newer version has a less powerful motor . I knew the second I turned it that the motor was different . It sounded like my old one with nearly dead batteries!It took longer to trim hairs and did not even do a thorough job.What a disappointment !
 I have purchased 3 of these , -LRB- 1 -RRB- a couple of years ago , -LRB- 2 -RRB- and -LRB- 3 -RRB- this last August , 2006 . The last two were purchased because of the performance of -LRB- 1 -RRB- . As of now , all 3 have failed because of a poor switch , which chooses to fail in the OFF position . This is all after testing with new batteries . The battery connection seems secure . All else works well when it works . The switches are the Achilles heel . $ 45.00 is enough of a test . I am going to try something else .
 I bought it from amazon.com and my husband just used it 3 times in 3 month and now it is broke . It does not work anymore -- broke ! I wish I bought it at a local store so at least I can exchange one after 3 month of purchasing . With amazon , you only have 30 days to try and return . Basicly it is not enough time for trying electronic products .
 I have had a previous model panasonic trimmer , but it gave up the ghost and I had to replace it . So I went with another Panasonic.My old Panasonic did n't hurt . Its blades were configured to hit the hairs at a more right angle , cutting cleanly and quickly . Hairs could only enter the cutting zone of the head on the SIDES of the cutter , not on the tip.This -LRB- reviewed -RRB- unit allows hairs to enter the END of the cutter , where they are TWISTED out of your skin . It hurts like crazy - and I 'm highly pain tolerant . I think they must have done it to make the tip smaller . But it 's a totally ineffective compromise . It made my eyes water and started an insane sneezing fit . Entertaining for my wife , yes , but this thing is no good . Not even worth returning - this is hitting the trash can .
 Of the 3 nose hair trimmers , ` personal grooming devices ' , I 've used this one caused the most pain . It has the tendency to grab the hairs as the blades spin , pulling them painfully.Be cautious with this device , I suggest one withOUT spinning blades and with reciprocating ones instead .
 I 've had a nose-hair groomer -LRB- Wahl -RRB- that actually cuts nose hairs - dropped it to a bad landing one day , and had to replace it . This Panasonic got such great reviews , how could I go wrong ? It 's `` chosen '' by Hammacher-Schlemmer -- must be the world 's best , right ??? The one I ordered did cut the nose hairs , but first gave them a good hard tug ! OWEEE !! Well , this ca n't be right , I said , so I exchanged my first torture device , and the replacement does exactly the same thing !!! Since it 's now the only one I have , I reluctantly go through this torture , with watering eyes and clenching teeth , every other month or so.OK , the results are clean-looking , but I really do n't think it 's worth the pain . Can NOT recommend it !!
 I purchased this item 6 months ago . This gadget eats away Battery quickly . After 5 months of usage this is simply not working . Please do not waste your money .
 This gadget never had much power , pulled at my admittedly jungle-like nose hairs painfully , and quit for good after a year . Next !
 Worked great until one day when it would n't turn on . Changed the battery , cleaned the contacts , disassembled and reassembled the head/blade section , and nothing . The thing just up and died on me . For fifteen bucks it 's not worth pursuing a repair or a warranty but I just want to warn prospective buyers that this is a distinct possibility . Still , it worked fine until this happened .
 It pulls hairs badly ! My husband tried three times and it does so EVERY time . He will never never use it again !
 Disappointed with this item . I have been using Panasonic ER411 for the last 2-3 years and it was a very good product . That 's why i bought this ER411NC . But ER411NC is not up to its expectations .
 After four months of light use the motor stopped working . Try another brand .
 This thing worked fine when I first got it . However , it quit working when I dropped it in the sink once . The drop was n't more than a couple of feet from the medicine cabinet into the sink -LRB- and WITH the cover on -RRB- , but much to my surprise , the darn thing just stopped working completely . It 's too bad since I did like it while it worked . Like another reviewer said , for the price I paid , it 's not worth the hassle of returning it or trying to fix it . In fact , I did already spend some time trying to see what went wrong , but it 's still messed up . I would stay away from it , or at least , drop test it a couple of times before you decide to keep it .
 Unless you learn to clean properly this product will not last .
 I never thought Panasonic will make a product which will hurt so badly . The one I got is really useless because it plugs the hair often .
 Looks like the one I have and am looking for another one even though mine still `` works '' . Very disappointed . I was going to Sharper Image until saw the 1 review .
 ... . which was not very long at all . As a nose trimmer that was operable , it cut very cleanly and without much irritation . The motor on this device however , decided it wanted to quit far too soon . No motor , no trimmer .
 Cheaply built & the blade speed rapidly declines upon each use despite cleaning & fresh batteries . I 've gone through two of these things in the past few months & ultimately gave up on them as they wound-up painfully ripping hairs out.Look elsewhere for a quality product .
 THIS TYPE OF NOSE TRIMMER IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE . PANASONIC USE TO MAKE ONE FOR BROOKSTONE AND IT CUT MUCH CLOSER . BUT NOW BROOKSTONE IS HAVING ONE MADE FOR THEM JUST LIKE THIS PIECE OF JUNK . OPEN IT UP AND IF THE CUTTING BLADES ARE STRAIGHT UP , IT 'S NO GOOD . LOOK FOR THE ONE THAT HAS BLADES AT A 90 DEGREE ANGLE AND YOU HAVE THE GOOD ONE .
 First one broke in less than a year . Same for the second and third . I give up . Do n't buy.Edit
 I read the reviews before buying one of these to replace an older Panasonic model that I liked . Quite a few reviewers reported this model pulls on the hair . I did n't know if they just had sensitive nostrils so I thought it worth a try . Well , I 'm sorry I did as mine gives a very painful experience and I 'm not an experienced hair trimmer user . And other models do n't have any better reviews , including the one that worked well for me before it died.I think the reason for the mixed reviews is a good number of these units come right from the factory with poor cutting blades , hence some love it and some winch over it . In hind sight I should have returned it but at the time it did n't occur to me this type of health and beauty items could be returned . The unit is reasonable well-made so I give it two stars , for performance alone I would it it none as I have n't found any use for it . If I had the box it came in I 'd wrap it up and give it to my worse enemy LOL .
 I purchased this trimmer for a X-Mas gift for my husband , he has an old trimmer he had used for years , so I thought a new good one for x-mas , I read alll the reviews and bought this one , well he says it works ok but it pulls hairs , this is a nose , ears trimmer , but he says it feels more like a type of torture device . His old one is still in use and I just wasted the money for this one . The old one is a Remington nedh-2500
 This fell on the floor as I was taking it out of the box , fell totally apart , and despite all sorts of effort on my part to put it back together , it does n't work very well . Maybe it is my fault and I am butterfingers , but something should not break that easily , especially if it is something that is made to be used around hard floors , i.e. the bathroom .
 Functions well overall , although a few painful nicks led me to be careful about not getting it too close to the skin inside the nostrils . Breaks very easily . Drop it 2-3 feet on a hard surface and it may no longer function - this has happened to me twice .
 That 's right , ouch . I 'm surprised other reviews have n't said this thing friggin hurts to use . A few point to keep in mind ; I have used a nose trimmer before w / no problems -LRB- chrome Remington model -RRB- . By `` hurt '' I mean it does n't feel good , not `` I 'm a puss '' . Lastly , I have nose whiskers not just nose hair , this matters . Just like shaving your teenage peach fuzz was no hassle compared to knocking down the man beard . This trimmer pulled out some hair and kind of ground down the rest . I think it would do a better job cutting finer hair ... not the 20 gage wire I 'm growing . Overall this product gets the job done but I would not recommend it .
 initially It was painfull to use . If you are not carefull , it will nick and pull hair . takes some time to get used to . It does a good job of cutting hair though.Also mine quit working after 3 months . I am a big fan of panasonic but not this product .
 I bought this for my husband last Xmas and it worked well until last month and the motor died . This year I am going to buy him about brand .
 Heard from my barber that this was a good unit . I bought it , and it was ... for about a month . Then ? New batteries notwithstanding , one day it simply would n't work any longer . Would n't turn on and defied me to figure out why . So , for twenty bucks who wants to hassle with warranty or repair issues ?? Not me ! The most effective , most practical solution seemed to be to hand launch the unit on a ballistic course over the fence of my back yard . It 's now slowly becoming one with nature , sort of in the manner of `` dust to dust '' -LRB- plastic to plastic ? -RRB- , seeking its own destiny with nature and the future ... . Hopefully the relic will be found one day by some future being , perhaps a member of a new civilization . Maybe he or she will ponder it , come to terms with it , and thereby gain more of an insight as to just how weak the underpinnings of the old America were , how the inoperative little hair trimmer is at some level symbolic of the failed American experiment as a Constitutional Republic , or the American failure as `` Emperor of the World . ''
 Have you ever droped your razor in the sink while saving ? Well thats what happened with this nose groomer the very first time I used it . The tip bent and is now unuseable . In my opinion it ' not up to standards.Save your money do n't buy it !
 I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister 's husband . He is very polite . Too polite . I finally found out that he had stopped using it because it did n't do a decent job of clipping those nose hairs , and I 'm not sure if I can return it at this point . I would not buy this again .
 I used this trimmer once and stuck it too far inside my nose . Extreme pain and blood pouring out . Had to call 911 and be rushed to the emergency room . It ripped the inside of my nose out . Wooooh !
 I keep buying this item over and over because it 's cheap . However , it always breaks after a few months of use .
 I have bought two of these and both sufferred the same terminal problem after a few months useage . The blade seems to get stuck against the external metal housing at the tip . You can unscrew the tip and the blades rotate , but reattaching the tip stops the blade movement . I 've taken both units apart and reassembled which sometime temporaily fixes the problem . No more for me ... nostrils will just get hairier . .
 After a year of light use , mine kept spinning but stopped cutting . My e-mail query to Panasonic was never answered . Caveat Emptor
 I just got it 2 weeks ago and once I tried it , I was hurt . It is true that it is water rinsable , which is great , but it hurts when you use it , not all the time but it does when you least expect it .
 Within the first week the blade got weak and it would pull the hair before cutting it . OUCH ! OUCH ! OUCH ! Then it would frequently stop spinning . This was very painful when a nose hair is caught in the trimmer and you have to pull it out . OUCH ! OUCH ! OUCH ! Basically I read all the good reviews and thought maybe I just got a defective one , so I was dumb enough to get it again . Exact same experience . Either I have an abundance of thick nose hairs or this is a crappy product . It might very well be a combination of the two.Honestly , every Panasonic product I 've owned has broken down on me before a resonable time . I opted to splurge and get a `` heavy duty '' nose hair trimmer from Sharper Image , and am quite pleased with it .
 More of a tickler than a cutter it left a lot to be desired in results . It also only lasted about a year
 Terrible . Cuts very poorly . The older units -LRB- with a split head -RRB- worked well . This version does n't .
 Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer , Wet/Dry , LightedBroken when I got it and a rep from Panasonic said they would send me an address label to return it but I have never heard from them . Will not buy any of their products unless this is resolved .
 Well i bought this on december 2005 , i used only 4 months , after that i dropped it and the blades went bad , not broken but they are not aligned anymore . I tried to fix it 3 times and i couldnt , but today i said that if i dont fix it i trash it , and finally i could fix it , its working again . But anyways , this grooming hurts a lot on the nose , and it eats a lot of batteries . I dont recomend it
 Pretty flimsy . Motor spins erratically and is fairly weak ... when it slows down it pulls hairs .
 The thing broke down in two weeks after about 5 uses.Panasonic refused to fix it.I 'll stick with scissors from now on ... cheaper and much more reliable .
 After about 6 months of normal usage , it just stopped working . -LRB- While it did work it worked fine -RRB- . I 'd suggest trying something else .
 I do n't know whether I got a defective unit or what , but it has a tendency to yank my nose hair , and my previous nose hair trimmer does n't do that !
 This little gem of a self torture device serves quite well in ripping out hairs by the root . The so called blades inside the head do not cut but instead the wind up your hairs and rip them out at the root . The amount of blood flow I experienced far out did any of my less than sober attempts using scissors . So if you enjoy that excruciating pain of shredding the inside of your nose , please buy this device .
 I have had two ER411 Nose and Ear Hair Groomers before making this recent purchase . I thought those ER411 groomers were perfect . You could cut on the end as well as the side making them very effective . Panasonic has changed the inner blade design so that it cuts only on the side . The old design was referred to as a curved blade design . Panasonic packaging still refers to the ER411 having the curved blade . In phone calls to Panasonic I have been told that the new design is in effect now .
 I had a similar product from Panasonic that had a lot of power and cut really great . It gave out so I purchased this model and I do n't like it at all . With new batteries , there is very low speed and the cutters do n't do an adequate job in cutting . I am very disappointed in the Groomer . I would recommending that you purchase this groomer locally so you can return it to the store and get your money back or try a different one . Maybe I just got a poor quality product .
 This trimmer was to be a replacement for my aging trimmer of the same make & model . This trimmer does not trim close like the old trimmer . I am very disappointed in the product !
 This product used to be excellent , except for short blade life . In my experience , the blade would go bad before the first battery had to be replaced . However it would trim small hairs from the nose and ears very well.Panasonic has changed the blade design from an ` L' shaped blade , which would trim hair entering from the top as well as the sides , to an ` I ' shaped blade , which only cuts hair entering from the sides . This has changed the trimmer into a lousy product . It now does a poor job of trimming hair from the nose , or ears , or anywhere else.Panasonic probably made the change so that the blade will last longer . Of course it will , because now it does n't trim anything . There is absolutely nothing on the package to let you know you are buying the redesigned product . Stay away from this product and buy from another manufacturer .
 I just got this model as an ` upgrade ' for my tired old ER112 , which has been my trusty companion for a few years now . One of the first things I noticed with the new ER411 was that I got an occasional sting from it . As a previous poster mentioned , it felt like a burn . The unit is n't getting hot , so it 's certainly the result of an occasional sensitive hair being yanked.I slowly built up some trust until the unit managed to grab up some of my nose lining -LRB- yes , it hurt and bled a lot -RRB- . From now on , the ER411 is for ears only . My old ER112 has never grabbed any skin and is the tool of choice for getting in the darker recesses of this bird 's beak .
 I have been happily using Panasonic 's ER411 -LRB- not ER411NC -RRB- for the last few years . I use the trimmer daily due to a family curse -LRB- lol -RRB- . The ER411 is the best trimmer I have ever used ... and I tried them all . The ER411 trimmed hair very close to the skin . Well , I dropped my ER411 and the trimmer was dead . So , I purchased the ER411NC thinking the trimmers were the same . The trimmers are not the same.As other reviewers have stated , the ER411NC is a re-design of the ER411 . The newer model does not work nearly as well as the older model . The newer model just ignores my annoying ear hair . Panasonic changed the blade design in the ER411NC . In an act of desperation , I replaced the cutting blades in my new ER411NC with the cutting blades from my dead ER411 , now the trimmer works great . Great move Panasonic!If you need a trimmer that cuts hair close to the skin , the ER411NC is not a good choice .
 I purchased this trimmer after owning a Wahl trimmer for 4 years , and what a mistake that was . I only used it three times and it broke after four months . It was also uncomfortable to use because it really pulled at the hairs . Do yourself a favor and look at other brands . I just ordered the following
 I purchased this product this past June and it is broken already . The motor is failing badly . Changed batteries twice and it has a grinding noise coming from it that does n't sound safe . I also believe it is rusting by being around our bathroom sink , and never in the water . I would n't recommend this product .
 Soon after I purchased this product , the On/Off switch began to malfunction . It worked intermitently for awhile and then quick working altogether .
 This kind of grooming item is not used very often . When I went to use it the third time , it would not work . I tried changing the battery , but the problem is with the unit itself . It 's never been dropped -- it just stopped working . I am attempting to get Amazon to intervene and replace the unit . I 'll let you know what happens ...
 Disappointed with this item . My husband has been using Panasonic ER411 for the last five years and it was a very good product . That 's why I bought this ER411NC for him . But ER411NC is not up to its expectations . If you can find an ER411 anywhere , BUY IT ! That 's what I 'm looking for - there should be some in a warehouse somewhere !
 altho my bro 's same model works fine still , mine deteriorated and stopped working after about a year . I do n't have that much hair and only use it for like half a minute a day , but it 's stopped turning . It did work well while it lasted , but I 'm hoping now the more expensive model will do the job a little longer .
 This item quite working after 4 months . I tried new battries and it still would n't work . I 'm not impressed .
 Trimmer works well for the price.My big caution is that it is not very durable . My first fell off a shelf and the 4 foot drop killed it . I bought a second one and it fell 2 feet into a sink and stopped working as well.I 'm gon na get another one and not keep it on those rickety shelves .
 It worked fine for a year . Then I dropped it onto a rug in the bathroom . Not on the floor , a rug . It immediately quit working . Busted .
 It never even turned on . Who do I return it to , Amazon or Panasonic ?
 I have bought three of these -- I keep thinking I just got a dud . Apparently , they 're all duds . They work okay -LRB- get the job done -RRB- when they work . But they only work a few months at most . The longest lasting one I 've had lasted about 5 months . The one I just purchased stopped -LRB- just stopped -RRB- working in a matter of a few weeks . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT .
 Mine conked out after only 6 months and maybe only 10 uses . The quality of the cutting blades was poor and resulted in some eye watering nose hair pulls .
 This device does an acceptable job of trimming nose and ear hairs , but at a price
 ... and I have the pain threshold of the princess from the princess and the pea story , these devices should be designed with me in mind.When brand new this thing worked like gangbusters , however the razor sharp blades dulled quickly leaving me crying like a baby.Perhaps if the hair that sprouts from your nose is fine this tool will suffice , I 'm still searching for the groomer that will be gentle to me yet viciously mow down stray hairs .
 When I first got the unit it worked fine . I noticed after the about three uses it 's motor was slowing down . I replaced the battery but it did not help . I used it 8 times in a year and it 's motor is all ready dead . I would not purchase another Panasonic unit being afraid it would all so die a quick death . Spend more money on a unit that will last longer .
 The first one of these I received painfully pulled hairs as it cut them . I ordered a replacement which was slightly better , but had the same problem . I would stay away from this model .
 This thing really hurts . Not a pleasent experience at all . Broke after the first few days . Save your money .
 It did not trim the hair but pull the hair out ... It is a good accompaniment if you are on the highway for a long long trip ... When you are sleepy , just trun it on and pull your nose hair ... Better than any refreshing stuffs !!!
 I used it once or twice and then it just gave up the ghost , and stopped working completely . For $ 17 I 'm not going to spend a lot of time trying to get it fixed or replaced , but I did see other reviews that talked of fast failures . Annoying and a waste of time and money .
 Like most things Panasonic , this thing broke down after about a year . Even when it worked , it was uncomfortable to use because even with fresh batteries it pulled hairs as much as cut them . It 's cheaply made , and in spite of its premium price , it 's a lousy product . Do n't waste your money .
 does n't seem to rotate fast enough so makes the job a bit too painful
 Owned this for about 6 weeks . When brand new , it was quiet and fantastic , really did the job nicely as opposed to my old method of trying to use a fingernail clipper or jam the corner of a beard trimmer in my nose . Problem is , as someone else reviewed , it may not work properly for very long . I only used it about ten times , and the next time I turned it on , it was louder than normal due to rattling like something broke or got off-center , I do n't know . Good thing it was only 14 bucks ... makes it somewhat disposable I guess .
 I only used it a couple of times and then it stopped working . Given this is a really simple device , maybe that 's why it 's so inexpensive .
 If you like the feeling of hair being violently ripped from your nostrils by a dull rotating blade , this is the device for you.I purchased this thing after reading the reviews and having general success with most panasonic products . I am extremely disappointed and can not recommend this product .
 Mine stopped working after a few months . Now it resides in a landfill somewhere . -LRB- * sigh * -RRB- To replace it , I bought an all-metal , mechanical nose trimmer from Vermont Country Store . No batteries to wear out , and no cheap plastic to break . It works just as well and , best of all , it cost the same price !
 I decided to buy the groomer after I have read so many positive reviews about it on amazon . The groomer works and trims the hairs fairly short . However , from the first time I tried it it hurt and tickled at the same time . That is the strangest sensation . The groomer pulls hair often ... very often ... continuously ... The combination of pulling hair and tickling makes your eyes water . My old scisors were sharper and I had to be more careful with them , but at least they do n't pull my nose hair .
 Interspersed throughout the comments for this product is the occasion person whose product broke shortly after purchase . I am one such person.The groomer worked very well and I was excited to have it , but it stopped working -LRB- meaning that it still ran but the blades did not cut any hairs -RRB- after about 3 uses . Yes , I cleaned it out and checked to see if anything was clogged or wrong with it . For some reason it whirred but would simply no longer trim hairs at all . No , it was not because my hair was so dense or thick that it ruined the device.Although it was only $ 15 I was hoping for a longer-lasting product . I would suggest shopping around a bit more if you are in the market for this type of device .
 Around my house , we call this The Ripper . This is a product for men . Manly , manly men . Men who wear flannel shirts and drink instant coffee and beer from cans.This is not a nose hair removal system -LRB- I do n't call it a trimmer , and you 'll find out why soon enough -RRB- for limp-wristed metrosexual prettyboys who squeal with pain when they spill their mochalattechino coffee-like substance on their extended pinkie fingers , because it does n't just cut the hair . It rips it right out.Ever pulled a nose hair ? Ever experienced that very unique burst of sharp pain?Count all the hairs in your nose . Then imagine a tiny version of that big drill-thing from the Schwarzenegger movie `` Total Recall '' boring into your nostril , grabbing each hair , then tearing it violently from its follicle.That is this what this product does . If you 're man enough to remove nose hairs this way , you shall reap the dividends , because a plucked hair takes longer to grow back.If you 're a sissy , go with another product ... one that simply trims the hairs .
 It worked great -LRB- although it could be painful -RRB- , the TWO times I used it . Then it died . A piece of junk . I had one of these a few years ago , and it only lasted a few months . Look for something better .
 It works like any other -LRB- while it works -RRB- . After about three or four occasional uses it quit . I assumed it was the battery , so I replaced it . It still did n't work . The battery tested fine . I use a Wahl now with no problems . I expected more from the brand . The device did not outlast its first battery .
 I have gone through two of these things . Once I dropped it and it broke apart like a piece of crystal.The second one just died after less than a month of use.LOL!Be careful you get what you pay for .
 i bought this flimsy tool and it just stopped working after about 8 uses . The price is so cheap that i guess this should be listed as a disposable groomer , hehe .
 At first this worked great , but after a few months the RPMs went way down , and I do n't know how to make it run properly anymore . -LRB- Changing batteries and cleaning it do n't help much . -RRB- When it 's spinning slowly , it pinches and does n't do a very good job .
 I bought this based on all of the fantastic reviews . I have to wonder , did you all use this yourselves on your own nose ? I ca n't review this against any other pure nose hair trimmer , this is the first one that I have used . I dread putting it up my nose . I found it to be painful and irritating , and I bled when I tried to get too close . Maybe all of the other nose hair trimmers are worse . A friend of mine had a manual nose hair trimmer that he wound up his nose , and it stuck , he had to pull it out . This is n't THAT bad . But I do have a Norelco electric shaver that has a beard trimmer attachment that does just as good a job as this without any pain or making me want to sneeze or whatever . I have not tried it on my ears , maybe it would be good for that , but I do n't need that . I 'll bet most people would like the electric shavers with the beard attachment better than this !!!
 This product has never worked right . It makes a lot of noise like it 's doing something , but spins and spins and does n't remove any hair . If you mash it flush against the skin -LRB- which is a real blast -RRB- , it might nick a hair or two . I had one of these previously that worked pretty good . It eventually died & I bought this ` upgraded ' model . Another piece of junk product made in China . Buy something else . I really wish companys would stop outsourcing production to China which clearly has zero quality control .
 i had this same nose hair trimmer for years and i dropped and broke it . i assumed this new one would be the same -- WRONG it 's horrible -- takes forever and does n't remove nose hairs or ear hairs . will look for a better trimmer . JUNK !
 I purchased this product and it just does n't work . There are few things more frustrating that placing a whirring cutting device into your nose and ears , and then waiting for it to do its job , trying every angle , all to no effect . I think the device 's little blade is too far down the safety nozzle for it to do anything useful for me . Your clipeage may vary .
 The reviews seemed good , but I 've found that the unit really hurts ! Yowch ! It pulls as it cuts , and stings like heck.Perhaps it 's defective , bad blade , or somesuch - visual inspection seems okay , but this is certainly NOT the way it 's designed to work .
 I took the trimmer out and pop a new battery in and it did n't even start . I heard there might be some quality issue with this product but this is ridicules . I did n't even had a chance to use it . ** Update ** Amazon immediately sent a replacement and I received it in 4 days . The trimmer seems to pull the hairs out of the nose in order to cut them . This is the first time I 'm afraid of a nose trimmer . I will recommend people to use with care .
 For almost twenty dollars -LRB- thirty dollars list , according to Amazon ... -RRB- , I thought this might be a pretty good trimmer . And the reviews seemed good , so I bought one . Well , I tried several new batteries in the trimmer , but it still nicked and cut when I tried it . Not for tender noses ! ... the thing hurts and leave red inflamed marks on tender skin . I really just ca n't stand to use it at all ... I fear it 's going to draw blood . It might be OK on ears , but I do n't need it for that . It 's also of flimsy construction and I 'm afraid that if I once accidentally dropped the thing on bathroom floor or countertop , that would be the end of it . I much preferred my old Wahl brand trimmer , which did a good job , never hurt , has been durable and lasted years -- and Wahl costs less ! The Panasonic is OUT and I 'm going to buy another Wahl brand .
 This product is absolutely powerless - very difficult if not impossible to groom Nose & Ear hair
 I used the trimmer for about 6 months , it worked great in that it cut the hair down very nicely , but it had a couple of downsides .1 . It would get very warm and and some times pull2 . When I dropped it , the cap came of very easily and the head hit the ground . -LRB- I thought the cap was supposed to protect it ? -RRB- Anyway I tried to mess with it to make it keep spinning but nothing I did help , I only dropped it a foot of the ground onto a carpet floor .
 The decision to purchase this product was based on the old theory , `` you get what you pay for '' . Not true here ! This being the most expensive nose and ear hair groomer offered on most sites , I assumed it was the best ! On the contrary . It was very painful when used in both my nose and ears . The rotary tip literally grabs the hair and pulls it from its location . Ouch !! My advise ... go with the $ 20.00 model !
 Mine worked wonders at first . But like a bunch of other reviewers it just quit one morning . I tried washing the tip but now it just makes an awful racket when I can get it to work . The blades seem very fragile . It appears after some usage the blades gum up and get distorted . It does n't take much to make it quit . I do n't expect it to last forever , but I did expect it to last longer than it did . I 'll be looking for a different product as a replacement .
 Then I dropped it once.From about 4 feet.Never worked again.Once , people.Panasonic , here 's a thought - how about a base cradle or at least a flat bottom so that when you attempt to stand it up it has a bit more of a chance against the laws of physics ?
 Mine quit working after about a year of light use . Not the best cutting blade either - tended to tug rather than cut cleanly .
 The picture does not match the goniometer ! As a result of a misleading picture , I ordered the wrong goniometer ! BEWARE !!! If you order this goniometer , you will not be getting what you see in the picture ! What I wanted was what is featured in the picture , but this is what I received : Protractor Goniometer - 8 '' By Prestige Medical
 profesh took about 5days before it started to work on my breath , then it only worked on my breath for about a good 5days after that it didnt work anymore . im going to try it again because it did work for those five days ...
 Used the product for over 10 years and worked great until my last shipment earlier this year . They obviously changed the formula as now it does not work . I would not recommend until they change it back .
 The first bottle work like magic , after that when you buy a larger quantity , the quality is not the same it suck . I switched to BreathRx and I 'm in love with it .
 The taste/smell of this product is not what bothered me . In fact , though it kind of smells like bleach , I did n't think it really had any taste . My issue was that it simply did n't work . I got through the first two bottles -LRB- about a months worth -RRB- before I decided to give up . I did n't get any results for my breath and I also noticed that this stuff tore up the inside of my mouth . Sometimes I 'd spit out what looked like pieces of flesh from inside my mouth or blood . My mouth felt clean , but no cleaner than normal mouthwash makes me feel . And my partner told me that regular mouthwashes were working better for my breath . Very disappointing .
 When I first got this razor I thought it was the greatest thing ever . It 's completly waterproof , so cleaning it is simple , you just run it under the water and add soap . It also gave me a really close shave , which was what I was looking for.Unfortunatly the razor refuses to charge , and I 'm not sure why . Because the razor can not be pluged directly into the wall , it is completly useless . Hopefully I just got a bad one , and everyone else 's works fine , because this was a very nice razor , when it worked . I would however not recomend buying a razor that can not plug into the wall .
 This is a very good shaver - except that it suddenly stops working , even when I follow the owner 's manual religiously . I bought my first one last fall , and after about 3 months , it stopped taking a charge . The replacement lasted about 2 months before the same thing happened . Now my current replacement shaver -LRB- # 3 -RRB- just quit on me with no notice , so I 'll have to call Panasonic again to get my FOURTH shaver in about 8 months . If this happened once , maybe twice , I 'd chalk it up to bad luck . But FOUR defective shavers ? ... so I figure this has a design flaw or poor quality control . By the way , my previous older model Panasonic wet-dry shaver worked just fine for over 2 years ... DO N'T BUY THIS SHAVER !!!
 I like to shave in the shower , and Panasonic 's wet/dry shavers seem to be the only available choice . They do work great ... until they fail spontaneously . They have the most amazing warranty expiration detectors . Every Panasonic shaver that I owned managed to fail within 3 months after the warranty expired.There are two varieties . The cheaper shavers have a clip-on charger . On those , the clip will break . The more expensive ones use an induction system . Those will simply fail to charge after the warranty expires .
 Ever the optimist , I decided to try an electric razor once again . Blades do an excellent job but , being lazy , I just do n't like the time it takes to shave that way . And yes , I used it as directed for the 30 days recommended.I am betting that those who say that this Panasonic razor shaves `` as close as a blade '' are either very young with still-soft hair or those who hate using a blade so much that they are willing to make do with much less.Don ' t get me wrong , this is not a bad razor as far as electrics go . It feels good in the hand and cuts about as well as any other . But you can get the same shaving performance from cheaper models.The problem is , as with all electrics , the razor just does n't give a close shave . The `` five o'clock shadow '' shows up by 2-3 o'clock . If you have a formal afternoon meeting , late date , etc. you 'll have to shave one , maybe two , more times before the day is done . Anything longer than a day or two of growth requires several full passes to get the job done . Obviously , a one-pass blade is faster in this situation.Of course , with the Panasonic there are no bleeding cuts due to early morning carelessness . If you just need a fast shave that 's good enough if not great , it 's faster than using a blade . This Panasonic is also quieter than many other electrics.If you really truly want an electric razor , my recommendation is to look at cheaper models first . Fancy features such as the high speed linear motors and wet/dry capability do n't add to the final quality of the shave .
 I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my husband . I waited almost a month for it to come in . I just received the shaver two days ago and I was thrilled because my husband really needed a real good shaver . Well , the next day , he tried it . It gave him a very close shave . I would say that the shave was excellent except for one problem . The shaver was extremely noisy . It sounded like a chain saw in his hand . You could hear him shave from all over the house including the outside . The noise the shaver was generating was just too much -LRB- it would drown out the television -RRB- so I regretably returned it back the next day and purchased a different Panasonic shaver - ES8003 . This new shaver felt the same except the noise was nowhere as bad . I had to pay more money for the new shaver , but my husband is pleased and if he is pleased then I am pleased too . We would have kept the Panasonic ES8036N if it did n't make such a racket . My husband felt too uncomfortable shaving with such a noise maker -LRB- he was really embarrassed -RRB- .
 I 've converted back to regular batteries - the rechargeables never seemed to keep a long charge and just became too frustrating never knowing if I was going to have my camera die in the middle of a tour .
 After 48hrs no charging , cells all cold . Printed out return and receivedrefund in about 10 days . Since then , I 've learned that you want a LOWdischarge rate for digital cameras . Get a 2100 mAh or thereabouts .
 After following instructions to the letter , I plugged in the unit to the outlet on the wall ; after a week , the green `` Charged '' light never came on .
 Rapid Charger is a little big to be travel portable in an age where carry on space is at a premium . However , the biggest problem is the batteries themselves started leaking within 6 months of purchase . This does n't create confidence in the product . i would n't buy it again .
 I bought these to use with my new camera . After charging the batteries they do n't last more than 15 minutes -LRB- fully charged -RRB- . I do n't understand why Amazon recommends the bundle . Stay away from this product !
 The first time I tried to use this charger it did not work . When I plugged it in the charging light did not come on . A friend who is an electrical engineer checked it out with his volt meter and verified that it did not work.I bought a new and different charger that does work . I kept the batteries from the first unit so now I have 8 rechargeable batteries.I did not try to return the bad unit yet as I went on a trip with my new camera .
 TWO OF FOUR BATTERIES WERE DEAD AT FIRST ATTEMOT TO CHARGE THEM . `` One Year Warranty '' requires $ 5 co-pay plus SHIPPING which makes the WARRANTY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE TWO WORTHLESS BATTERIES
 These batteries only charged one time after that they would not hold a charge -LRB- we found out at my sons graduation , I wish I had brought extra batteries . -RRB-
 I ordered this item Nov 16 , 2007 . On Nov 22 this item now shows on my ordering tracking page as not being delivered until after Dec 25 . No notice from Amazon .
 That 's what I thought when I read the review about the batteries not charging , where the charge light came on for about 15 minutes before turning off again and the batteries never charged . That 's almost exactly what happened to me , though . I say ` almost ' , because after the first time , the lights never came on again ... not the red light nor the green.To be honest , I expect it could have had something to do with using a voltage converter while in another country , but one would hope that the manufacturer had allowed for such bizarre occurences as one leaving the United States and wanting to charge batteries while abroad for more than a week.One upside of this is that I can still use the batteries themselves so long as I get them charged in another charger . In fact , these batteries have lasted longer on their first charge than the batteries that came with my camera . If I could give a separate review of the batteries , I 'd give them 5 stars , but the charger will remain the subject of any new invective I can dream up for the next few weeks . Buyer beware !
 On first usage , I noticed the next morning that only one pair of batteries showed a green light . I tested all four and it seemed like they were all charged , but the charge did n't hold when I tried to use them in my camera about a week later . Nimh batteries are supposed to keep their charge much longer . I got this at special pricing -LRB- around $ 6 or $ 7 -RRB- due to my camera purchase , so I did n't bother sending it back at any additional cost .
 The batteries are no good and the charger itself is crappy . Zero stars and I would recommend that you get a charger and rechargeable batteries but just not this one .
 Sounded like a good deal , bought it , did not charge batteries at all . Returned it for a replacement , second one did not work either . Maybe the batteries were no good , maybe the charger - who knows but ... do not buy it , go to RadioShack , their re-charger worked as promised .
 I bought this from Amazon for Christmas 2009 to accompany the digital camera I was giving my wife . The non-rechargable batteries we put in the camera lasted until April . Then , I plugged in the charger with the so-called rechargable batteries . When the light showed green , I unplugged the charger and batteries . The next day , I put the batteries in the camera which immediately reported `` battery exhausted '' . I feel like I wasted the money I spent .
 The charge light would not come on after second use.I tried the digipowersolutions web site listed on the package.Got a warning that it was a bad web site regarding privacy and vendor reliability.It 's so cheap it is n't worth shipping it back.Don ' t buy this piece of junk .
 I bought these for use in a camera . After a short time I went back to using alkaline batteries due to the short battery life.Pro 's
 I bought the product for my new Camera - Canon Powershot SX20 IS . It was advertised along side with the Camera in Amazon website . So I thought they are the right AA battery for my camera , which uses AA . When I used them in my camera the other day , the camera did not turn on . Then to my surprise , I found the rechargeable AA batteries that came with this product have 1.2 V votage instead of a standard AA battery , which has 1.5 V. I felt cheated , and do not know how to return the product to the vendor for a refund . Any one has any advice ?
 the charger looks and functions good but the batteries are dont seem to be 2700mh , even when they 're not used they lose charge . I am actually planning to return it.I used kodak 2000mh before and they used to last much longer.I have n't tried other model batteries so far so dont know if it 's the batteries or the charger . .
 The included batteries were already drained when I put them in my camera after charging them for 24 hours !
 I bought it , charged them , etc. . But they never worked . Not sure if it was the charger or the batteries , just returned them for a refund .
 When this showed up at my house , none of the lights would go on - and I followed directions perfectly . Not sure if it was just my luck or a sign that the quality is poor , but keep it in mind ! Sent it back and decided not to replace it . I have a feeling for the money I could get a rechargeable battery set of much higher quality -LRB- although the car charger is a plus -RRB- ... Good luck ! ~
 This battery charger is poorly constructed and -LRB- mine -RRB- does not work as advertised . It has a switch that will supposedly allow you to charge two or four batteries at a time but mine will only charge four . The two battery function does not work . The only reason I am keeping this is because of the car charging function which is why I am giving it two stars and not one .
 I purchased this 2 weeks ago . It does not work . I put the batteries in the charger . The red `` charging '' light came on for about 15 minutes , then it went off . The green `` fully charged '' light never came on . I installed the batteries in my digital camera -LRB- my camera takes 2 of the AA -RRB- . I took 4 pictures and the battery low indicator came on . I tried the batteries in my friend 's digital camera -LRB- different make and model -RRB- , same thing , with any/all of the batteries . I tried charging the batteries again , and again . Same thing every time -- charging light comes on for less than 20 minutes , then goes off , and the fully charged light never comes on . The batteries do not get anywhere near a full charge , and the batteries get very , very hot while in the charger . It appears to be of questionable quality . I will be returning it and asking for a refund . I do not recommend the product .
 I bought one of those kits bundled with my new Flip camcorder and the batteries do n't last more than 15 minutes -LRB- fully charged -RRB- . I do n't understand why Amazon recommends the bundle . My final opinion
 The construction of the charger allows it to lose connection with the batteries = no charge . It overcharged/heated the included batteries to over 140F - I could n't even handle them bare handed . It is , in my opinion , a piece of junk . I would not buy one of these ... I should 've listened to the other reviews .
 This may be a good charger but the deceptive representation of the product overshadowed everything else about it for me . There is a customer image that shows the charger with both a cover and an AC adapter . That is not a picture of this product . In fact , the exact same picture is used to represent the Digipower DPS-5000 1 Hour AA/AAA Rechargeable Battery Kit . How can the same exact picture be used to describe two different products ? Amazon should correct the obvious problem created when someone either knowingly or unknowingly uploads a photo that misrepresents a product . It would save the trouble of customers ' having to return the product and the cost of Amazon 's dealing with returned open packages -LRB- I could n't be sure of the lack of the above two items without opening the package -RRB- . I guess , if you know about the false photo and like the charger , it could get a higher rating . This review mainly is about the false `` packaging '' by Amazon . The features that the product was misrepresented as possessing -LRB- through the photo -RRB- were exactly those that I was looking for .
 The charger and/or batteries are obviously defective on the unit I received.The green `` charged '' light comes on even when there is no charge in thebatteries . Leaving the batteries in the charger for as long as a week seemsto make no difference - the batteries will charge up enough for about 3 shotsin my digital camera , and then - nothing . This seems to be a very hit-or-miss product , based on other reviews .
 I bought this one month ago , the charger stop charge the battery . It is not good charger . please do not buy it .
 The batteries it shipped with lost their ability to charge in about two charges . The charger itself is OK , but nothing special
 I wish I would have listened to the other reviews . I have had the exact same experience as all the other negative reviews . Charged the batteries , put them in my Kodak Zx1 and they lasted just a few seconds . Tried another pair , out of the four and same thing , lasted a few seconds . Popped in some regular old alkaline batteries , and lo and behold , they worked.It really surprises me that Amazon continues to sell this product . This is JUNK , JUNK , JUNK , just like all the reviews say . Do n't waste your money and time . I took a chance to save a buck , and got burned . Do n't do the same . Too bad I have to even give this product one star .
 Took the plunge to get these because I was ordering $ 370 camera and Amazon pitched this as a half price item if purchased in combination . Obviously I should have checked the reviews anyway . Put the batteries in the charger , they wo n't charge . Remove them , replace them , charger lights right up and eventually registers a full charge . Put them in the camera , it wo n't power up . Remove them and replace them and it powers on fine . Check them with a battery tester , 3 of 4 check fine , one shows no charge . Check it again a few seconds later , and it shows a full charge . THESE ARE UNRELIABLE JUNK.Pitching a bad product -LRB- and from the quantity of poor reviews this has been a poor product for some time -RRB- is a disappointment , from a retailer I WANT to be able to trust !
 We ordered this unit along with a new digital camera , and could not get the batteries to charge at all , so obviously it is useless . The unit is clearly not operating properly . I am in the process of attempting to contact their support department and will follow up more with what transpires , but am disappointed that this unit was not properly tested prior to shipping .
 What a total rip off ! Took three hours to fully charge the batteries and lasted only 35 minutes in my Canon Powershot SX20IS . Wasted a trip out to the Golden Gate bridge . Cheap drug store name brand Alkaline 's lasted far longer . It would be a great product if it delivered on the 3-hour use . Not recommended for anything other than a tv remote . BOOOO ! HISSSS ! BOOOO ! Rip off !
 bought as part of a package with a camera - batteries would not charge sufficiently to activate camera . Not worth headache of return - good reason to buy locally from brick and morter store at similar price
 Bought these for an RC car , after about 4 days 2 of them started leaking , Through all 4 out . Not worth the risk in my opinion .
 The watch arrived as promised . My daughter had to set it for me as my eyesight is extremely poor . I found it difficult to understand the computer voice-though I will admit my hearing is not the best . After onlya little more than 2 months however , the watch failed to function . The screen went completely blank and just simply shut down . My daughter tookit to have another battery installed , but it still would not function . Someone needs to go back to the drawing board on this one .
 I purchased this watch for my husband who is blind and needs reminders to take meds . The watch worked great for about 3 months . Could not beat performance or volume . After 3 months the watch kept reseting all alarms to factory and turned all alarms on . Even after replacing the battery the problem still remained . I am going to try another one just incase this one was bad . The price makes that doable and my husband loves it . I will also buy a different watch just in case .
 I assumed that for $ 15 , plus shipping , that this would be a very nice mask . It turned out to be extremely uncomfortable though . The mask itself is black pastic -LRB- which is fine -RRB- , but it has foam around the outside that is cut for a person with a very small head - it never felt quite right since the foam would be really close to my eyes . In order to keep it tight enough to keep it on correctly it would crush my nose so that I couldnt breathe . The strap is made out of velcro , which always rubbed/scratched my ears . I havent been able to fall asleep with this mask on .
 The mask consists of a heavy cheap piece of black plastic upon which ovals of foam rubber have been added to cover but not touch the eyes . How can they charge $ 15 !!!! Probably works reasonably well if you 're leaning back on an aircraft , but if you turn your head slightly while lying in bed , the large plastic edge begins to push the mask away from your eyes . I next bought the large blue sleepmaster mask and very highly recommend it for larger face coverage than the standard masks and its softness + no elastic .
 If I were to give an honest appraisal of this item , I would would say it had a value of about five dallars !!! -LRB- at most -RRB-
 This mask totally blocks the light , this is the good thing . The bad thing is that it 's made of plastic at the top so it 's not comfortable to sleep while wearing it . it might be useful for a nap in a car or a plane , as long as you are sitting still .
 The black plastic is hard and sharp and could easily injure eyes . It is probably great for meditation , and anyone who sleeps only on their back , but in my opinion too dangerous for anyone who does not .
 What are your intentions with this product ?! Are you trying to smoke some stuff and then go on a vision quest for about 15 minutes and use this mask to shut out light so you can explore the inner cavities of your mind ? That 's not what I use this product for , however I 've heard of that , and if those are your intentions , then this product is probably great for you . However if you have to sleep in the daytime a lot I would n't really recommend this mask for 3 main reasons . First and foremost , its VERY uncomfortable . I mean seriously , who the heck designed this thing , it is TERRIBLE . it will hurt your nose , the area under your eyes , and especially around your ears . To really block out the light you kind of have to strap it against your nose so that it is difficult to breathe through your nose . Even then there are certain angles at which light can get through , so that finding the perfect angle is a kind of game . If you need to sleep in the day time and are as much of a light sleeper as I am and have as many insomniac tendencies as I do , then the few minutes it takes to wrestle with this stupid contraption to get the lighting right and the comfort level tolerable , could be the difference between a good night sleep and NOT SLEEPING AT ALL and being resentful that you bought such a stupid product . Research around , there are far more comfortable masks out there , albeit , more expensive , but then again you get what you pay for .
 This is just a piece of plastic with a piece of foam glued to it . The foam has cutouts for the eyes , so you 'll get good blackout when using it . Ergonomics are poor , and it oozes cheapness . So , practical and useful , but not very nice looking . I keep it in an end table drawer for occasional use in the living room on the sofa .
 Glad I did n't pay the full price of around $ 20 from the Mindfold website . I paid $ 12 w/free shipping on Amazon but still think that is a bit much . I Love the concept of opening your eyes in total darkness but this product is pretty cheap . I agree with one review stating that they could 've went to a crafts store and made their own . Other than being overpriced , the only issue I have is that the strap is uncomfortable around the ears . Definately not for sleeping -LRB- unless you 're on your back all night -RRB- but good for meditation.NOTE
 I was incredibly disappointed in the quality of this mask . It 's basically a cutout of flexible black plastic backed by a foam cutout that sits between the plastic and your face . The shipping cost was outrageous ... almost as much as the cost of the mask itself . I wanted to return it , but the cost of the total shipping would have exceeded the cost of the mask itself , so I kept it . Do not make the same mistake . You can easily recreate this in a craft store for about $ 1.95 .
 I 've only been using this off and on for two weeks so it seems to be doing okay . I will update it as I try it more consistently and for a longer period of time.EDIT
 I purchased a bottle 100 Vcaps , and the vitamin E was in the form of d-alpha tocopherol succinate , a pure ALPHA form and NOT the much superior mixed forms of vitamin E . The various products listed here are NOT all the same.Look at the zoomed labels for each before you buy . I am a college professor who teaches an upper level nutrition course , and I PERSONALLY feel the evidence to date suggests that the only the MIXED should be used as a supplement . The Dr. Weil brand is one such product , as are SOME of these options on this page . Order with care ! Amazon , check into this .
 On Amazon : The product title says SAMe -LRB- 400mg -RRB- The description says SAM-E 2X 200mgOn the product : Front
 It 's not 400 mg . It 's 200 mg , 1 bottle . Both the main title and the 2X are misleading . There are cheaper version of 200 mg tablets listed .
 I honestly tried this every day for 3 months . I could not tell that there was any difference in my mood or fibromyalgia pain .
 The pumice came off from the wooden handle very quickly after when I used it for 5 times . And the pumice by itself is very `` aggressive '' peeling off the skin which should be peeled off and which is not . Waste of money ! Do not recommend to anyone .
 I bought this pocket watch for my legally blind father-in-law . The watch is attractive and keeps good time . The alarm -LRB- especially the rooster -RRB- is reasonably loud . The voice telling the time -LRB- upon pushing a button -RRB- is clear and speaks slowly enough to be easily understood.However , I ca n't recommend this watch because the voice telling the time is too quiet . Since many of the intended users will be elderly , with failing vision AND failing hearing , this is a serious problem . My father-in-law still has decent hearing but in any kind of noisy environment he ca n't hear the time .
 I bought this for my father who has macular degeneration and he found it to be just so , so ... the biggest issue he had was finding someone else to help him set it up and show him how to use it - because - the directions were written in `` tiny '' print and he could n't read them ...
 I used this for two days , and it stopped working on the second day . I 'm not sure if it 's worth a return or not , but it was definitely a waste of $ 4.65 !
 These things are very powerful . I 've tried them a few times and each time i have to take it out of my mouth as it burns too much . If noticed my lips get a little swollen for a few days after trying one of these , as it seems to make micro cuts on them .
 I was n't impressed with the product , but it shipped quickly and received without any problems . Priced way too much for this !
 I suffer from ichsthyosis and I was hoping this would be the end-all for my condition . Nope . This product is no better than an over the counter lotion -LRB- like curel , etc -RRB- . It costs a lot -LRB- with shipping -RRB- and it smells bad .
 Texture does n't really spread well on lips , and is a bit too solid . -LRB- You feel like you 're getting too much out of the pot every time you slide your finger over it . -RRB- The glass jar made me nervous every time I dropped it , and in in the end , I went back to the lip balm I loved better from C.O. Bigelow . The smell is honey-esque and fragrant , however , but this does n't make it a product that merits its price .
 claims to be natural/organic although product ends up smelling like plastic . Used it once and never again . For extreme dry lips , try pure shea butter instead .
 This pen is the best writing tool I 've ever used.There is only one problem . I do n't know what they use to decorate the pen , but the pen has a layer of decorative swooshes and logos etc that are printed or painted on.This layer flakes off in tiny tiny pieces , leaving your hands covered in what looks like glitter that is a pain in the ass to get remove .
 when i opened the package i noticed a plastic/rubbery smell to it I washed it a few times but it 's still there . i also noticed it collects lint no matter how I store it . other than that it has a nice size and it does what it 's meant to ; -RRB-
 Too big ... and I 've had 2 kids . . yucky smell . Discolored after awhile and I tossed it . Save your money . I would also recommend measuring your partner or current toy for size .
 My wife says it 's too big . She says it 's not even comfortable . She prefers the real thing . It is quite big !
 nice shape , size , texture but that smell is too much ... what to do with an unused dong ? dog toy ? even he would not fetch it !
 This really does smell bad i dont care what anyone else on here says . You touch it and the plastic smell get all over your skin and that is all you can smell . It pretty big it was ok for me just depends on what you can handle but it some much like plastic that it hurts when its in because it sticks like plastic save up and buy a better one , I have already throw mine away
 It 's too big even for normal people . It 's so uncomfortable to use . Even with lubricant , it hurts . What a waste of money . Now I have to ask my boyfriend to get one for me when it 's our anniversary .
 Hate the smell . could smell it even after i put it in the trash .
 At first I loved this big fellow but , it is very difficult to keep it lubed and it requires tons of lube . Even my own lube from the G-spot is not enough . I tried the g-spot lube since bottled lube is not enough but , still it is not enough . I tried petroleum jelly and that made it worse . The material is just not conducive for play for more than a minute . Maybe I can sell it used on Ebay . LOL Karen
 Huge is about all that I can say . I do n't think that I was expecting it at all and have not used it much as a result .
 it 's huge , which is n't a bad thing , but so smelly i do n't even want to use it . the smell gets on everything it touches . you can smell it on your hands , even after washing your hands .
 I guess my girlfriend was way too tight for this product . It is hard to tell exactly how large it is when you see it online , but it was too large for her . She did n't enjoy it and it was tossed.May be more enjoyable for a girl who has had children or who needs a larger instrument .
 You will never loose this item because the odor is SO strong . I thought the strong latex odor would dissipate with time . Even being left out to `` air '' it still has a very strong odor . Also , if you insert it in your anus it stains and it is impossible to get it clean looking again . Would not recommend this item .
 I was looking for a similar compound to Supreme Enzymes -LRB- `` SE '' -RRB- made by Chantilly Health in Florida . Based on the ad I thought I 'd found it . But it really does n't compare . The SE 's are the best . I do n't think that there is compliment to them out there . Chantilly Health 's web site is n't the best . So if you want them call !
 If it had cost more I would have sent it back . Would n't recommend it to anyone who wants chapped lip reflief .
 I got this because of my back injury that has been really bad again lately and I sit a lot in my computer chair . The one big problem with this backrest is that the curve of it sticks far from the chair making the space where your legs go is cut to half of what it originally was . My back feels better but now my legs hurt because they hang over the edge too far because of the curve of the backrest .
 The Obus forme seat and seat back appear at first glance to be just what is necessary to make a chair more comfortable . However , I have to report that if they did anything , they ultimately made my chair less comfortable . The product tends to slide around on the chair , and take so much energy to keep them in place that they ultimately become almost painful to sit in.I finally returned these products for a refund .
 I was expecting a firm backrest , except it is soft and hollow on the inside ; therefore it does not provide any support at all . It feels like you are leaning into a piece of cloth .
 I have one just like it . I use the BD Magni Guide every day . It is so convenient to use and I think it saves time . Just the right size . Very pleased with this product . This product magnifies the numbers and lines of the syringe . I just really feel that this is an excellent product .
 while it holds the bottle ok , it does NOT hold the needle in place ! it has an open channel that helps guide the needle into the bottle but then you 've got to hold the needle in place , turn the guide over and still draw the insulin while trying to hold the syringe in the channel . results
 &#34; MAGNI-GUIDE &#34; lens so distorted the numbers on the insulin syringe that I could read the numbers better without it ! bAH
 The epilator has a great design , is easy to use but is to small and not efficient enaugh . It takes ages to perform a perfect epilation on all the body .
 I thought that product would be good to use , it lasted two weeks and stop working , The sleeve does nothing for you . Maybe I could use it as a bone and give it to the dog instead .
 Sorry but I hate this thing , my hubby bought it for me to livenup our sex lives a bit , but I think it is horrible and definitelydoes not feel good at all to me !
 Wow , got 2 of these free yesterday for me and my partner at the supermarket with free coupons . Good thing I did not spend anything . Once we bit into them we both looked at each other in shock . How can this taste so bad . And they are small thin bars . Would need 3 to get filled up . Lara-Bars and 1000 times better and more natural and moist . These are dry and taste like cardboard .
 This bar is advertised as a 1.6 oz . bar , it 's a 1.06 oz . bar . big differance . The tast is ok , but it is to small .
 The material is soft and smooth and it feels ok but a g-spot toy would be alot better ... Maybe a tad too long .
 The smells are terrible , It kind of very strong rubbery smell . I kind of afraid to use it , but It 's not worth on returning it . So I would not want to recommend it to anybody .
 The zombie flavor is just gross . The chap stuck its selfs is smooth and nice but I could n't get over the smell of this flavor .
 It does n't taste or smell like Grand Marnier I was very disappointed . I would rather have my chapstick in cherry flavor . Atleast It has a taste .

 What was sent to me was NOT `` Elastikon '' , but a cheaper veterinary version.It 's a very different product with less stick and is much lighter weight . If you 're looking for `` Elastikon '' athletic tape , this is n't it . It would be helpful to have this specified . I sent mine back .
 I ordered Elastikon , which is a name brand of a product by Johnson and Johnson Company.Instead I got a different type of elastic tape which does not compare to Elastikon . I did n't return it because I needed it at the time . The tape does the job , but curls up after you cut a piece and is very difficult to work with . It does n't hold up as well as the real Elastikon does.This product should not be sold as `` Elastikon '' as it is not Elastikon .
 This is NOT Elastikon tape . It is a similar , lower quality veterinarian tape . If you need it for your pet , great . If you want Johnson & Johnson Elastikon tape , this is falsely advertised -LRB- Elastikon is a trademark -RRB- . They did send a postage paid return label , but I am still waiting for my refund .
 Elastikon is a trademark from Johnson & Johnson company and it can only be used to call their specific product . However , what I got from this seller is a box of `` Elastiant '' from VetOne . This wierd product looks kinda similar to Elastikon but has a very strong , distinctive odor that is very bothering -LRB- unlike the real Elastikon -RRB- . Elastikon from J&J ; should receive 5 stars . But in this review I give only one start because what you get is something called Elastiant from VetOne.Don ' t buy this product . You will be frustrated for sure . I am seeing if I can return my items to the seller for refund .

 This is my second Doc Johnson . I had another one about 10 years ago and have had some other pocket rocket types in the past . I was not impressed with the power this provided . Too weak for me .
 Will it get the job done ? Probably.The lack of multiple settings it a bit frustrating.Strong for it 's size . The first time we tried it , I thought it would rattle my fillings loose . Too much for me.If you need something portable , it seems small enough although I 'd say that if it falls out of your hand bag , ai n't no body gon na mistake it for something else.I got mine free with purchase so I ca n't complain about the cost . But I would n't have spent much for it . However , it seems well like by other reviewers . I guess I just prefer something more along the lines of a rabbit or the Wee Vibe .
 It worked at first , then the switch began to fail . Changing the battery did n't solve the problem . I had it about a month . Now ... this thing no longer works . I have no idea why.Maybe water got in while being washed . The top of it kind of separated , so maybe it allowed water to seep in.Why make a product like this that can not be washed or that is n't at least partially immersable in water?Now , tell me , is it something that I can return to get my money back ? I think not.Don ' t waste your money on it .
 Great for feet massage or neck massages , but not much else . Hard plastic shell , very angular .
 We had an egg before , and the egg was a lot more silent , and worked better for producing orgasms than this device .
 The three beads on the tip pisses me off . I can never hit the clit on the right spot . It 's 3/4 width just does n't make sense when it 's built to vibrate a very small organ.I learned that it needs to be dried off very well . I washed it and left it aside to air dry . A few weeks later the beads started to rust . I 've tried washing it again but it was permanent.Simple , vibrating is strong . But it 's easily corrosive .
 I like that it is small but my 2 speed vibrator goes way faster than the pocket rocket . It took like 15-20 min to get me off when i expected to feel it within 5-10 min like my 2 speed vibrator . I wish i could get my money back but i already used it . Can I still return it and get a full refund ?
 Doc Johnson The Original Pocket Rocket 4-Inch Ivory VibratorThis thing worked well for 2 sessions , then the motor quit . DO N'T BUY !! Would welcome troubleshooting advice . Otherwise do not waste your money ...
 The necklace broke the first time my husband took it off . It 's entirely too short . I am doubly disappointed because when it arrived the first time , the &#34; diabetic &#34; inscription was missing ; I returned it , and the item , as it was advertised , did make it back before Christmas .
 the id necklace chain has no clasp and it barely fit over my head if someone had a bigger head it would not fit at all also the diabetes stamp u can not make it out
 This bracelet , although relatively inexpensive , is too cheaply made . The links from bracelet to chain are cheap and can be pulled off . The emblem comes off -LRB- as mine did -RRB- as it is just glued on . The word DIABETIC lightly engraved on the back is barely readable and in less than good lighting conditions may not be able to be read at all . Not recommended at any price .
 Folks come on my Grandmother always told me you get what you pay for , what did you expect for under five dollars . I too ordered one , not the greatest , but I expected that because of what I paid for it , I am not going to be shocked or surprised when the emblem breaks , or you ca n't read what it says on the back . I did not buy it to impress anyone . I just want the authorities to know that I am a diabetic , if I ca n't tell them myself . My main gripe with this company , is that the item was backordered , and no one told me , so after about three weeks or so after the due date I became concerned -LRB- NOT TOO CONCERNED ONLY 5 BUCKS -RRB- , but none the less they told me `` OH YEAH THAT HAS BEEN OUT OF STOCK ON BACK ORDER WE SHOULD BE GETTING THEM IN SHORTLY '' It would have been nice to know this before I became worried ... Bottom line you get what you pay for ...
 The medalion is pretty basic and standard , but they did n't put a clasp in the chain , and after a few weeks the chain broke .
 The pic shows this as having the word `` DIABETIC '' engraved on the back of this item ... it arrived with this not present . No problem for me , as I will dremel it in myself , but this is not what is shown on this item sale page , and is not what I ordered .

 I bought this in advance of a long car trip . My lower back can get sore after extended drives , even though my car has decent lumbar support and I sit up straight with the seat almost as straight as it will go.The main problem with this as a back support for driving is that it is too large to use and remain sitting straight . Underinflation is an option , but it is not very stable in this configuration , even when driving straight . So my back is more mobile and this actually adds more back strain than it helps -LRB- especially when cornering -RRB- . I will try this in an office chair but I am not optimistic that it will be useful.The valve is the standard one used in cheap water wings and other toys . It works okay but makes inflation/deflation harder than it would be with a good valve -LRB- like you 'd find on a Thermarest -RRB- .
 Rarely write reviews but I love Amazon and am compelled to share . I used this in my car for a few weeks and it sprang a leak . Ok , I thought , we 'll patch it and that 'll be it . Nope . Three more times in different areas -LRB- seams , etc -RRB- . I 'm an average guy -LRB- 5 ' 9 '' and 155lbs -RRB- so not too much force on it . Sick of it . Not even recyclable : -LRB-
 ORDERED THE PRODUCT , USED FOR A HAPPY MONTH , AND THEN THE PRODUCT DEPLETES IN 15 MINUTES , NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY . AND AMAZON DOES NOT ALLOW RETURN FOR OVER 30 DAYS . A TOTAL WASTE . I HOPE THE MANUFACTURE WOULD AT LEAST PROVIDE WARRANTY . EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.GET YOURSELF A PILLOW INSTEAD , MUCH MORE DURABLE.JUNE , 2012 UPDATE : THE SELLER IMEDIATELY CONTACTED ME AND SENT ME A REPLACED ITEM . GREAT ATTITUDE . I AM CHANGING 1 STAR TO 3 STAR . I HOPE THIS TIME THE REPLACED ITEM WOULD WORK OUT LONGER . IF IT WORKS OUT WELL , I WILL UPDATE.AUGUST , 2012 UPDATE :2 MONTHS HAS PASSED , IT STILL WORKS.AUGUST , 2012 : AT THE END OF THIS MONTH , THE PRODUCT LEAKED AGAIN . THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT A PRODUCT THAT COULD LAST .
 This product worked great for the first two weeks . Somehow it developed a slow leak and no longer holds air for longer than 6 hours which means I have to refill it everyday . Not sure how this happened . It 's been in my car since I purchased it . The quality could be better .
 back booster 101 inflatable lumbar support cushion did not perform as i expectedafter 5 days of use started to leak and loose air every day had to reinflateutlmately gave up keeping it inflated
 Very comfortable and I thought I 'd get a lot of use out of it despite the flimsy looking seams . I was wrong . Started leaking right away and just gave it up less than 1 year after purchase .
 I bought a Back Booster about six weeks ago . Inflated slightly and installed in car . After adjusting amount of air for comfort while driving , I used it for two or three weeks . Then the air went out , the booster lost its boost . Blew more air in the next time I drove and it lasted two days before deflating again . Apparently the valve leaks . Not repairable , it appears .
 I bought one a couple of years ago and it started leaking after a few uses . I bought another and it too started leaking after a few uses . They both started leaking from a seam towards the bottom.I would n't buy one again , I guess you get what you pay for .
 I needed a new back pillow for when I sit for long periods of time . I used it on a four hour flight and my back was worse when I got off the plane . It does n't move with your back and was very stiff . I doubt I will ever use it again . It took me a few days for my back to recover .
 I purchased this product to replace my previous lumbar support cushion by another company that lasted 2 years . The cushion was nice while it worked , but it started leaking air in two weeks under very standard use -LRB- car , office -RRB- . It was returned for a refund and I am going to try anothe product .
 I bought 2 of the back boosters because my husband and I both have had back surgery and need lower back support in the car . We were both very disappointed in their function . To much air makes them hard and a little air is very uncomfortable . One of the booster leaks and is always flat . We would like to return them for a refund if possible . Thank you
 As it specified , it is supposed to be used occasionally , such as travel , not daily use . I tried to use it daily at my office , but it soon worn out , and deflate quickly . I have to return it .
 UPDATE
 I had the same experience as Robert of Niagara . It worked well at first , but it developed a leak after a week of use in my car . It quickly became useless.This happened twice . -LRB- Thinking that the first one I bought just had a defect , I foolishly bought a second one . -RRB-
 We bought 2 of these , but only used one in flight . The pillow deflated 3 or 4 times in the pressurized cabin and was of little use . We never used the second one . I am very disappointed .
 UNRELIABLE QUALITY THOUGH GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICEI purchased this Back Booster -LRB- 2 of them -RRB- somewhere else . One of them started leaking air in a week . The manufacturer sent me 2 not 1 as replacements so I thought it was a good business practice of theirs.HIGH HOPESI fly quite a bit for work and I 've always carried with me an inflatable lumbar support -LRB- or two -RRB- and the lumber support -LRB- s -RRB- sometimes work and other times not as each plane model has different seats . This time -LRB- last week -RRB- when I flew , I brought the Back Booster with me and really had high hopes that it would work as it appeared to be ergonomic.DOES NOT WORK ON THE PLANEWell , I had to fly 2 segments at 3.5 hr each from coast to coast each way . I sat on the planes for 14 hours in a 3-day time frame . I 'm petite and the Back Booster was not even wide enough for me . It 's also either too hard or too soft and wobbly . I could not get comfortable whatsoever.CAUSED MORE DAMAGEOn my return flight , my back started to hurt and I had to walk slowly from one plane to another . By the time I finally got to deplane at the destination , my back was in so much pain that I could n't even straighten it as I walked . I had to bend my back forward walking very slowly ... I am still suffering a week after I flew and used the Back -LRB- pain -RRB- Booster!RECOMMEND AGAINST ITDo not waste your money and cause yourself harm .
 This item arrived with no instructions but an impressive list of disclaimers . I inflated it , strapped it in the driver 's seat of my car and it felt great . I drove 5 miles to a shopping center for a 15-minute errand , and it was completely deflated when I returned to my car . I reinflated it , and the stopper popped out of the inflation point almost immediately . I 've returned it to Amazon for a refund with a suggestion that Amazon dump it and let street vendors handle it from now on .
 i used this back support 2 times and it started leaking air . support ok but i should get more than 2 uses . will not buy another one .
 i had high hope for this product , it was in expensive . the concept was easy enough.but as a car seat addition ? no . no sir.when inflated to the max it pushed my lower back forward so much i could not rest my upper back and shoulders , i released 90 % of the air out to fit my cars ' seat design , at then i still has to be readjusted even with the secure straps which keeps it in place . but since it 's 10 % inflated is weirdly shaped and eventually uncomfortable .
 This cracked along the seam within 2 weeks of use . It had the proper support but is of inferior quality .
 This seemed like a great thing , I ordered it for the airplane rides on my recent international adventures . But in just a matter of weeks it wo n't hold air any more . I did n't damage or puncture it , and I ca n't see or hear where there is a leak . So it 's a disappointing addition to the land fill , now being too late to return it . I 'd suggest a different product .
 I 've purchased this product twice in less than 1 year . While it 's very helpful when inflated , after a month or so it wo n't stay inflated for more than 30 minutes of use . I figured maybe the first one was just a dud , so I purchased another one . I still have the same problem - I use it in my car driving to and from work -LRB- a 45-minute drive -RRB- ... I blow it up every morning and by the time I get to work , it 's flat . I blow it up in the afternoon for the drive home , and again , it 's deflated by the time I get home . I 've had the same problem with both of the supports I 've purchased . No only is it inexpensive , it 's cheap and not worth the air it takes to inflate it twice a day !
 Pillow started to leak after 6 weeks of having it . Leak is in a seam and deflates completely on 30 mins . Return policy is 30 days . Be careful ...
 It does n't stay inflated . It 's fine for a short time but loses air quickly . I 've tried several times so I plan to return it .
 This cushion lasted just long enough that I could n't return it to Amazon . It developed a severe leak , and would not stay inflated for more than a few minutes . In looking at the reviews , other people experienced this same problem . Buyer beware . Do n't waste your money on this product . It was a good cushion while it lasted , but one does expect something like this to last a bit longer than 40 days.Update 02/2008
 i had to return this item 2 times bc it kept deflating . first week it was fine . then 3rd week it basically started leaking air ... not good . otherwise , the shape , the fact that it can get compact , make it very useful for flights and at work - but the manufacturing issue is a problem .
 Pros : Has soft fuzz-type exterior.Cons : Strap did not fit around car seat well . Will not fit any bucket type or indented seats . It would work on a flat backed chair , but otherwise the strap is superfluous and gets in the way.The curvature is not adequate and being inflatable it does not hold its shape well . A firm type foam back support I had once that has a similar -LRB- but more pronounced -RRB- curvature and is much better.After a day or so of using it in my car it went flat .
 As others have noted , this thing leaks a lot . Basically , it is single layer construction -- like the cheapo type of air mattresses for swimming pools . The outside has a kind of short velour-like texture , which is not bad . Despite the leaks , it works okay for sitting on the sofa . However , I originally purchased it for use during an air flight . I discovered that since the seats are so close now , when I used the cushion my face was too close to the seat back in front of me . I purchased this thing for a reduced price , so the low level use is okay . However , at $ 20 or so now , it is well overpriced for the quality . I will look for something else to support my back ...
 This item does not work in a car . You can not use it and have any part of your back touching the actual car seat . It would be good for promoting upright posture so that one can balance a book on one 's head while driving , but who wants to do that ? The center of a good lumbar support needs to be somewhat concave . I just found really good ones at Walgreens for $ 5 each !
 DO NOT BUY !!! These are so comfortable because they are adjustable . HOWEVER I bought two of them and both developed leaks , the first one within one month of use and the second within nine months .
 I have purchased the back booster two times . I was disappointed that the first one failed , but pleased at it 's portability and support so I decided to take a chance and get a second one . Now , the second was has failed as well - only 4 months old ! I am hesitant to order a third one . I use this on long flights which I only do two to three times a year and I am having to buy one every time I fly so , not such a great financial solution to lower back pain . Will try another product
 Having a bad back , I was looking for anything that would help the pain . I watched the infomercial and was impressed with the product . I ordered the item and it was received with great expectations . It took very little effort to inflate and I was ready to use it . It stayed inflated for about two to three hours but gradually lost its firmness as it began to deflate . It obviously had a leak . Contacted Amazon and they authorized a return.Have since pruchased another product -LRB- considerably more expensive -RRB- made from memory foam and it it 's super .
 Does what it needs to do -- but has a slow leak so must be reinflated every 24 hours . That 's a disappointment .
 What a disappointment . I followed instructions and used as directed , but it has a slow leak . I submerged it underwater to search for a puncture , but could not even find the leak -- that 's how slow the leak is . I reinflated about every 2-3 days at first , then it would not even stay inflated for a full day , so I 'm returning it . I wish I knew why it 's leaking air , but maybe it 's the entire product .
 ... suddenly it deflates quickly.while it worked it was excellent . I have to locate the leak.Worked in the car -LRB- a few times -RRB- as well as home . I have had it for a month or so .
 This product is nothing that I thought , is a cheap version of something great , I waist my money and the worse thing is , I bought one for my sister and sent that over sea , s. after I spent so much money on postage to that country , she will be disappointment with what her sister send her . what a sad story .
 The zombie flavor is just gross . The chap stuck its selfs is smooth and nice but I could n't get over the smell of this flavor .
 It does n't taste or smell like Grand Marnier I was very disappointed . I would rather have my chapstick in cherry flavor . Atleast It has a taste .
 Research on this product indicated it would help lower cortisol levels . High cortisol levels can result in anxiety , elevated heart rate . I did n't experience these results . In fact , I noticed an increase in heart rate and a `` pounding '' heart beat when taking the product . This resulted in sleep disturbances and headaches . These symptoms stopped when the product was discontinued .

 The product that I brought was `` Delicious Strawberry '' and it did not taste good or smell good at all with water.But seems to blend right with milk . But I strongly do n't recommend you buying the strawberry flavor , cause it taste like some rubber and it smells horrible . Your best bet would be reviewing other flavors or perhaps start with muscle milk which I previously enjoyed and will continue to use it instead of this product .
 It was OK after removing the lumps in the bag harder chocolate lumps we were not sure of so rather then take a chance we took them out of the product . It seems OK but could not get response on product from maker if we should be concern or not . They are rated well on bodybuilders dot com etc. . Maybe got a bag exposed to moisture is all we can assume since we got no response other wise to date
 I had to throw this out when I discovered a poorly tested artificial sweetener named Acesulfame . Acesulfame may stimulate insulin secretion aggravating low blood sugar attacks . Acesulfame produced tumors , leukemia , and respiratory disease in several rodent studies according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest ,
 when I received the protein , it seems it was a used one , it was covered with dust and the box is damaged , when I open it , the film was half opened . seems like a returned one . and the effect is bad , incomparable to other products I used before , takes me more days to recovery . BAD !
 I guess that you 're supposed to know what `` Acesulfame Potassium '' is before you buy this . I did n't realize that it was their artificial sweetener before I bought it because this is the FIRST time that I 've seen Aspertame listed as `` Acesulfame Potassium '' . Why would anyone want to purchase a health product that has an unhealthy ingredient in it ? Total waste of a product and $ 52 . I did get an awesome migraine out of it this morning after tossing some down before I went to work . Maybe that 's worth $ 52 somehow ? Nope , not for Toxic GARBAGE .
 I used to get one of these 5lb tubs per month at the price of about $ 35 through subscribe and save -LRB- reg about $ 40 -RRB- . Did it for over a year ... maybe even 2 . loved the product and loved the price . Suddenly got an email a couple months back that ON does n't want to participate in the Amazon subscribe and save program any more . So I come here to see what the regular price is and was expecting $ 40 -- without the S&S ; 15 % discount -- but see that the price has been jacked up to $ 53 ! I would have been fine paying $ 40 without the S&S ; discount , but this is ridiculous.Seems to me like an underhanded business tactic for ON to use S&S ; to get people buying it regularly , then discontinue the program and jack up the price . Sorry ON , but I 'm not playing that game . I 'd rather switch to a lesser protein powder than do business with you now . -- UPDATE > 3/22/12 -- Here are some links to other protein powders that are more reasonably priced , and that are in amazon 's S&S ; program :[ ... -RSB- -LSB- ... -RSB- -LSB- ... -RSB- -LSB- ... -RSB- -LSB- ... -RSB- -LSB- ... -RSB- -LSB- ... -RSB-
 hey guysi bought this product after looking at the reviews . i had this after my workout past one week , and i am getting terrible unease in my stomach . is this specific to me or any1 else have faced this ? also i want to know if we need to drink more water on a daily basis , when we consume whey
 I was excited on this product when I got it but soon very disappointed . It could n't be mixed with water even I stir it for 5 minutes and the taste is terrible nothing like most other people rating.I bought a different one at Costco and it taste much much much better so I through away this product earlier this morning to my trash can . I am not recommended
 Based on the reviews , this seems to be a popular product . I bought it and tried it out . First thing I noticed is that it 's very sweet . Much sweeter than other protein powders I 've used . My mistake for not noticing earlier but the ingredients list includes Sucralose , which has been linked to migraines , liver disease and tumors . It 's also just REALLY sweet so a little goes a long way.Unfortunately the seller does not accept returns so I 'm stuck with a 5 pound can of unusable product .
 guys . i have a question . is this the real on whey protein ? i did not know that the scoop inside was golden . . as far as i know is white . . can somebody please help me /
 I 've been ordering this product mainly through Bodybuilding.com . I went ahead and purchased this 5 lb. , choc . chip flavor from Amazon , due to the fact that I saved on free shipping and no tax.I first opended the product and noticed the smell of it was different . I mixed up a protein shake and immediately notice bland taste to it.I can compare it to the choc . chip I purchased from Bodybuilding . com , which has a fresh taste to it.So , it seems to me that Amazon receives Gold Standard Whey products that have past their expiration date . It still works as I do drink it daily , sometimes twice on the days I work out at the gym . I 'm still getting good results and can tolerate the taste.I believe I 'll not order this product from Amazon any longer and continue to order from Bodybuilding.comThis is only my opinion , take it or leave it ... good luck !
 this product tasted horrible -LRB- strawberry flavor -RRB- i did my research online and it said that O.N was one if not the best protein shake out there , so i went from dymatize elite fusion 7 to O.N and i regret it so now im back to ELITE FUSION 7 great price and the BEST FLAVOR OUT
 I 've bought this same product many times from other retailers and it has been great , for some reason , my purchase through amazon -LRB- which turned out to be 15 $ cheaper when using the subscribe and save discount -RRB- has little to no flavor to the powder - it tastes very chemically with a slight hint of chocolate flavor . very disguisting to drink when compared to my past experiences with a dozen bags or so through the years ...
 great product , best protein powder for the price . as for the banana flavor it got to become a chore to drink it . I had the chocolate before and i drank it everyday without any problem . I would recomend getting vanilla and maybe adding a banana to it . the banana flavoring just was n't very appealing day after day .
 I 've tried and enjoyed both the Double Chocolate and Vanilla Ice Cream flavors -- Double chocolate is okay blended with water , and tastes just like chocolate milk when mixed with milk . Vanilla ice cream I do n't like as much with just milk or water , but it is good for smoothies -- I 'm not much of a `` vanilla milk '' person , but it does taste quite good and tastes very creamy , to me.After scouring reviews , we decided to try the Rocky Road flavor . BIG MISTAKE . It tastes very artificial -LRB- like almond extract , is the best corollary I can come up with -RRB- , and has returned the dread I used to associate with having to choke down a protein shake . If you add peanut butter or a banana to the shake , it helps a lot , but you can still get the odd , fake flavor . Ewwww . Stay away from Rocky Road ! We now have five horrible pounds to try and get through . Might end up giving it away , if I ca n't figure out a way to make it palatable.That said , all three flavors we have tried blend up very smoothly -LRB- yes , even nasty rocky road -RRB- , with any of a variety of methods ! I use -LRB- depending on the situation -RRB-
 Stick with regular chocolate flavors . This one does not taste good unless mixed with milk . Even then it , to me , tastes like it has cinnamon in it . I bought other chocolate flavors in the past that were much better . Overall product is good though .
 I just recieved my 2lb chocolate malt today in the mail , when I opened the package , I find out that the seal is broken and that only 1/3 of powder is in the container . I have found no way to contact them other than packaging feedback . I will no longer be purchasing anything from amazon unless they take care of this scam .
 The stuff does not all mix in . It says to use 6 to 8 ounces and even when using 12 ounces of milk and stirring for a good 3-5 minutes you get this gloopy mess on top . It has bad taste too , definitely chocolate-like but very weird .
 well does any body know a good healthy shake that will help you lose weight and build muscle but lose weight more ... i wan na try whey protein optimum gold standard 100 % natural whey but im not finding the right reviews
 I tried it , loved the taste , but the effects of the whey protein made me so violently sick I pitched the rest of the can . If you can not tolerate Whey or milk proteins in any form , then the best advice is to Fuggedaboutit . I suggest Sun Warrior ORMUS Organically grown Super Greens and the new Sun Warrior vegetarian source protein drink instead . People who can not tolerate milk , or are vegetarian and do not eat meat or products from animals like milk or eggs will find the Sun Warrior Protein Drink just perfect . Nope , I am not a representative for Sun Warrior , just an avid fan of such a incredibly rich and wholesome , organic source as Sun Warrior . I do not trust any of these Whey products because they do not tell you if they come from hormone fed cattle , or what . Certainly most are not organic .
 Tastes like powdered coconut . I had such high hopes based on other reviews but alas this is about as bad as the original strawberry flavored protein powder I used to buy when there were no other options .
 My first try was Strawberry and Banana which was amazing . Even after reading those bad reviews about it 's taste , my second choice was still cookies and cream ... BAD decision ... It leaves a terrible feeling in my stomach after every protein shake I have . Ca n't wait to get rid of this junk and go back to strawberry and banana ...
 I enjoy a variety of ON Whey products . In plastic jugs , they have a great taste . However , these variety packs have a bad metallic taste to them . I would recommend getting the 2lb . jugs instead to try a flavor , as the sampler is not representative of the product .
 the cookies and cream taste is horrible . I wish I could take it back .
 I bought this shake because of it 's high reviews . I have previously been drinking Herbalife protein shakes but wanted to switch to whey protein for the price and for more protein . My sister even recommended this product to me saying it was delicious . I mixed it up in my shaker cup and poured it into a glass . The aroma it gave off was terrible . It smelled like rotten eggs ! I tried it anyway and sure enough , it tasted like it too ! I thought maybe it was a bad batch so I had my sister try it . She said she thought it tasted fine . Maybe this is how all whey protein is ??? I do n't know , but definitely not for me .
 Length :
 The Seal was completely broken when I got it . I do n't know if someone ate some powder and then sent it to me , or add something else into the powder . Sending the item back would cost me too much time .
 I have only tried 4-5 different types of whey protein shakes , but the double chocolate flavor from Optimum tastes horrible . Typically I do n't have a problem drinking whey shakes with only water as a mixer . The first time tasting this protein with only water - I literally had to chug the shake so that I did n't taste it and then run to the fridge to get a chaser to wash the horrible taste out of my mouth.I assume that mixing it with milk will improve the taste some , but I highly doubt it will be improved enough so that I want to actually drink a shake after a workout . In summary , while this might be a great deal on good protein , the taste is so bad that I am probably going to just throw out the 5lb container after only using one scoop ... totally not worth the money .
 I exercise at least an hour every day . I take protein after ever workout every day . I have been doing so for quite a few years . During my time trying different proteins , this has to be the worst yet . I really do n't see why this has such high ratings . It 's a complete ripoff . The price for this crap is terrible ! The best protein I have tried to date is by far Body Fortress Super Advanced Whey Protein . The price is much better , it contains everything optimum has plus more more recovery supplements already in it . It feels much more filling and tastes far better . I would recommend staying away from optimum nutrition . If you do n't believe me , just try Body Fortress yourself . You can get a 2 pound container for only $ 15 at Walmart or several other stores/sites . You wo n't regret it . You will regret optimum nutrition after trying body fortress though .
 Did not receive the order even though tracking info said it was delivered to the front door . Filed a claim with A to Z and was told that I will get a refund but it 's been more than 10 days now and still no sign of a refund . This has been a bad experience overall .
 I have used other ON protein products with success - I do n't care for the flavor of artificial sweeteners , but have learned to deal with it . I have tried this product only 6 times since purchasing 6 months ago . I did n't want to believe that it was causing stomach upset , but today 's use has confirmed that it is this product and not a cold or some other food . Not good when you use right before going to the gym . I did some research and found that a number of people have stomach upset with this product - it could be that it is just spoiled , but there is no way to really tell . Recommend buying a small size if you have not used before . I am stuck with 5lbs of whey .
 Until the last jug of this product arrived , I agreed with all of the five star reviews -- but then the company changed the formulation . Here 's an e-mail I wrote to the company and their boilerplate response : `` BLEH ! I 've been happily using your Double Rich Chocolate Gold Standard 100 % Whey for years but the last jug I bought is awful ! At first , I thought there was a mistake in the manufacturing process , and then I noticed that you more than doubled the amount of sodium in the product -- up 117 % . Why ? Not only is the flavor bad , but many manufacturers are actually reducing the sodium content of products for health reasons . As you must be aware , Americans consume way too much sodium . Surely it 's not in your interest to promote hypertension among your customers . I 'll be checking out other products the next time I buy . '' `` Thank you for choosing ON . Yes , you might have noticed changes in sodium and cholesterol levels on the facts panels of Gold Standard 100 % Whey . At this time , the formula has not changed , and macronutrient levels of carbs , protein and fats remain exactly the same . Only levels of sodium and cholesterol have changed - and only because we approved new premium raw ingredient suppliers . Optimum has always made a point of accurately reporting the nutrient profile of all protein powders on facts panels . It 's part of our uncompromising commitment to superior quality . Making sure that our valued customers are aware of even these small changes is very important to us.Best Regards!Rebecca JohnsenConsumer Affairs RepOptimum Nutrition/American Bodybuilding `` The company failed to address the point of concern .

 I use this product online regularly , but this particular flavor is lacking . The taste is more like vanilla ice cream that forgot it was supposed to add flavor to it . Imagine ice cream without taste and sweetness and you have what this taste like .
 I 've been buying ON 's products for well over a year now and have been very happy with them . In fact , when I shop for protein powder , creatine , etc , I first look for something from ON 's line . But something must have changed recently , because while this is the same protein powder I 've bought before , this recent shipment is really disappointing . It tastes bitter , and does n't mix well at all . What happened ? Something definitely is off . I wish I had n't bought a 10 pound bag of the stuff , it 's not going to be pleasant choking this stuff down for the next few months .
 I 'll never see how good this is because I can hardly manage to choke it down after a workout . I 've tried it with water and/or milk in a shaker bottle , blended with banana , yogurt , peanut butter , etc. . . a n't make it taste decent . By time I can get it to taste like it 's edible , I 've mixed so much other stuff in there that I might as well have not even bothered . I got this as a gift from a friend that had a BOGO coupon from a local supplement shop , and I really wish she had the decency to get a good flavor .
 I have purchased other Optimum Nutrition products but never in the 10 lb . Would n't you know the first 10lb bag we order is awful tasting . Oh well , when it is gone will most diffidently go back to the other flavors in the smaller amount since they are not offered in the 10lb bag .
 I bought this product on reviews , reviews said this product was not the best tasting but it was horrible ... they were wrong . this product is horrible , i have only been able to drink 2 shakes , there is no way im going to be able to finish the product . my boss is a really big protein shake drinker & has drank many different types & flavors , he was barely able to stomach this product . in my opinion , dont buy this product .
 The flavor of this product is n't as good as Carb Solutions Vanilla product . Plus , it tends to be a lot more `` foamy '' . I wo n't order it again .
 I just ordered Muscle Milk for the first time since Amazon informed me that Optimum Nutrition has pulled this from the subscribe and save program . I like the product , but not very happy with the company for pulling it from the program and raising the price .
 I originally bought the Double Rich Chocolate based on good reviews , and its impressive 24g of protein per serving . When I first tried to mix this with water , I could n't believe how bad it tasted , I have never worked so hard to get a protein shake down . I tried mixing with milk and it did n't taste any better . I ended up throwing the container away after using only 4 scoops . What a waste of money , luckily I only bought the 2lb . size . I suspect that they may have changed the formula on this , because most of Amazon 's 5-star reviews for this product are over 2 years old.I 've since switched over to Designer Whey 's chocolate flavorDESIGNER WHEY Protein Powder Supplement , Chocolate , 4-Pound Containerand the difference is remarkable . I mix one scoop with about 6oz of hot water and it tastes like a low-quality hot chocolate , much better.The downside to Designer Whey is that it only has 18g of protein per serving , but that 's partly because the serving size for Optimum Nutrition is 17 % larger -LRB- 30.4 g vs 26g -RRB- . If you were to use the same amount of Designer Whey , it would have 21g of protein , which brings it 's numbers much closer.In short , I would highly recommend you buy a small size of any protein supplement to test it out and if you do n't like the taste of this , try Designer Whey .
 I love the brand , Gold Standard is very good in all regards . I 've been exercising and taking protein shakes for many years and after all my research , I am very pleased with the brand . Rocky Road is the best tasting protein shake I 've ever had , but I thought I 'd try something different and get the Chocolate Malt . I ca n't bring myself to down it . My wife tried it and could n't stand it !! Absolutely the worst tasting protein shake I have EVER had , period . So much so I needed to post something on here !!! Just an FYI , try it for yourself if you must . ROCKY ROAD IS AWESOME . CHOCOLATE MALT IS TERRIBLE .
 One is first attracted to this product because of the cheaper price but what you get , unsurprisingly , is a cheaper product.If you do n't mix it in a blender you are left with a clumpy mess . Mixing it with anything but milk would be a horrible idea , mixing it with water is nearly impossible . I will never buy this product again and hate to throw it away but it is a grade D product with its only redeemable part of it being the taste is not half bad .
 Vanilla is so bland . I have tried many flavors of Gold standard and if you are looking for the one with the least flavor , this one is probably it . It did work well to mix with my strawberry pre-workout drink that has a strong flavor because the vanilla was unnoticeable .
 This was my fifth tub and I have been pleased with it until I learned of what is actually in it . Along with almost all others , it contains arsenic , cadmium , lead , and mercury !!! Why ? Is it made in China !? Check it out online or in the July 2010 issue of Consumer Reports . The powder with the least of these was Solgar . That is what I will most likely be switching to .
 French Vanilla Creme was just bearable . It wasnt very bad , but just bearable enough to keep intaking this for the next 2 months . Will i purchase this again ? Nope.I thought this was going to taste something like mocha flavor , but i was totally wrong . It taste like vanilla with bannana and less tasteful.I have a very good taste bud since i like to try every food in this earth , including hot and spicy stuff , all meat , pasta , and , maybe , insects.It can range anywhere from Hindi , Chinese , Japanese , Korean , Mexicans , Thai , Fiji , and Italian food.Alot of the foods that i eat are very delicious.But , this is just bearable !
 I expected more from this with having many good reviews and it 's claims of being of choice , but after taking this I 've realize what a waste of money I 've spent . The taste is the worst . I would n't dare recommend this to anyone . Has a really bad after taste that leaves you feeling weak and nauseated . And that 's not even the half of the problem with this supplement . Right after I take this , I would say with in like ten minutes I 'm having problem with my stomach . Quite frankly this product is a gimmic and should be banned . I would recommend to those looking for a protein supplement to look into EAS or Weider .
 this product is just ridiculous , they use such a big bottle but only fill on third of it , and the powder does n't seem to really dissolve in the cold milk . Most importantly , after using it for 2 months while keep working out everyday , I can see nothing obvious happened to my body . BS
 Absolutely horrible taste . It tastes like chemicals . No idea how this got so many good reviews , unless these people are putting a lot of bananas , ice cream , or other things into their protein shake . I mix mine with milk or water , and this is the worst protein I 've ever tasted .
 I was very disappointed to find antihealth sucralose in a whey product and I intend to return it .
 This 10 lbs whey protein is very nice size but is so so quality , i used it for a few months and nothing amazing happened , but when i changed to the muscletech and eas produts i feel a big change . Also the price here is too expensive in comparison with other stores .
 This product gave me an allergy , I felt like I was going to die or something , I get nightmares just thinking about it . It seems that 0.5 % of the population is susceptible to soy allergies and I happen to be one of them . Anyway , this product is not completely whey like the company claims , in fact it has cheap soy added to it . If you will look at the allergen information , it says that soy lecithin is been added to improve mixability . I feel like I have been cheated , if I was living in the United States then I would have sued optimum for sure.People get your facts straight , whey is imported into United States from Newzealand and Australia . If you check any Newzealand or Australian sites you will know that Whey isolate is very very expensive . It is impossible to sell 10 pounds of this stuff at $ 60 -LRB- even if it was a mix of whey concentrate-a cheaper version of whey -RRB- If some of you consider suing Optimum , please remember me and send me check as well :--RRB- Right now I do n't take anything manufactured by so called `` bodybuilding product '' companies . Remember in 2005 another company Ultimate Nutrition was sued for Super Complete capsules by some Swimmer and had an out of court settlement for half a million dollars .
 I tried this and it just tastes no different than chocolate milk and drinking it did n't get me an ounce of muscle . I 'm better off eating beef jerky and steak . Milk is n't really good for the body anyway .
 I ca n't believe no one else noticed that the shipping charges are outrageous for this company - about 5 times what they should be.I put the name on my black list .
 This smells and tastes a bit like the synthetic flavoring on microwave popcorn . I 've tried many different flavors of this product before and they were very good , however this one is not . It 's a limited time flavor the packaging says ; there is a good reason for that .
 I purchased this in hopes of using it for the first time . I opened the package and was appalled
 I duno I didnot like the taste of the product shipped . Actually , earlier I bought same product from G N C I found it taste different . .
 Mixes fine , but it tastes horrible ! The only protein powder that literally makes me gag ! My next protein powder will come from Smart Powders .
 The cookies and cream product used to be awesome . Ordered my first one couple of months back and it was the best protein flavor made by Optimum . The next one that came in had something horribly wrong with it . Smelled like crap , did not mix well in water and was nasty overall . Sent that back and Amazon sent us another one as a replacement . This one does not smell , but has the same mixing / color issue . Maybe Optimum had a bad batch or they have changed their formula . Pretty much sucks now .
 I bought 100 % Whey protein the double chocolate flavor today because I could n't get to a store that sells my usual Jay Robb protein . I have to say the taste is not even close to what I 'm use to . Its not repulsive or anything but Jay Robb 's protein taste is way better . For some reason Jay Robbs even makes me feel more ... . fuller ... satisfied.Glad I just bought the small 1 lb .
 I went through 5 lbs of the Vanilla flavor mixing with water and it tasted fine.I decided to try a new flavor this go-around , so I bought Vanilla ice cream flavor . Big mistake , tastes like chemicals . Others have mentioned taking this with milk , so i 'll try that .
 I bought Optimum Nutrition Whey protein this time because there was more protein than their competitors.When I tried ON protein the first time I found the drink to be thin and runny . but the flavor was good.This time it is even thinner than before , and the flavor is almost non existent.I have tried ON whey protein , twice , GNC whey protein , and two others that I will not name because their consistency was like mixing water and sand.For flavor and consistency so far I MUCH prefer the GNC proteinI recommend you avoid Optimum Whey Protein if taste and consistency are important to you
 I bought the Vanilla Ice Cream based on the reviews it had and I prefer to order from amazon vs other sellers . But the taste of this product is n't great at all not sure how I would be able to finish the bottle . I just hope something is n't wrong with it because amazon is currently reviewing this item .
 It was OK after removing the lumps in the bag harder chocolate lumps we were not sure of so rather then take a chance we took them out of the product . It seems OK but could not get response on product from maker if we should be concern or not . They are rated well on bodybuilders dot com etc. . Maybe got a bag exposed to moisture is all we can assume since we got no response other wise to date
 I 've been using whey protein for almost a year . this so called deciduous strawberry does n't taste good . not awful either !
 This flavor is kind of weird . When I make a shake with the recommended 6-8oz of water or milk and some ice , it does n't taste very chocolately so it 's not as tasty as I was expecting . However , it is VERY filling , which is awesome . I usually ca n't finish a whole shake .
 I 've tried a few protein shakes on the market . I 've heard great things about ON Gold Standard and their quality . I had been taking some Intek Evolution protein , which has great ingredients , and tastes amazing -LRB- I look forward to my post-workout shake -RRB- . However , at $ 60/5lb jug , it was getting pretty pricey.I accidentally ordered two jugs in the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor -LRB- wanted the Double Chocolate which i hear is decent -RRB- . It 's not that the ingredients are n't good , I ca n't STAND the flavor . It 's by far the worst tasting whey protein I have ever had . I 've tried everything , water , milk , almond milk , soy milk , even adding a bit of cocoa powder to it . Nothing . I now dread my post-work out shake . I cry to myself every time I see the unopened jug sitting there , waiting for me to reluctantly open it and consume the hellish powder that lurks inside . I 'd give it away to someone but that 's just plain cruel.If you do n't care about flavor , or simply have some sort of strange , mutilated taste buds , go ahead and get the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor . It 's cheap . However , i 'd rather spend double the price for something I can stand . With Intek Protein , I found myself enjoying it to satisfy my sweet tooth , it was the perfect desert drink . Not so much of Gold Standard . Very Sad .
 I got halfway through the bottle and could NOT get myself to finish the rest , it 's TOO SWEET . Yeah , they 're saving the consumer calories , but the sucralose dosage in this stuff is overkill , highly recommend ON 's `` Any Whey , '' it 's all natural ; `` Any Whey '' will be my next purchase on Amazon . My only credibility I have is I have lost count of the bottle 's of Optimum Nutrition Pro-Complex Whey since first using in 2005 . . hope this review helps .
 I tried this after reading some positive reviews but in my opinion it tastes horrible . I will stick to the fruit punch flavor from now on .
 I figured I 'd branch out from the more simple flavors like chocolate or vanilla . I do n't think strawberry banana is nearly as good .
 Strawberry flavor ai n't a good choice . . Chocolate flavor is a way better flavor in the same product . .
 I do n't know what people are talking about when they say the Chocolate flavor is awesome . This flavor sucks . And I 'm stuck with a huge tub of this crap that I 'll just end up throwing away . It tastes thin , weak , and like a bad super watered down version of Chocolate Slim Fast . Gag ! Skip this for sure . It 's really gross .
 Ordered this , came in time and I chose the banana flavor , my last brand was syntha6 chocolate and it tasted amazing , switched over to whey with banana cream with water and it tasted horrible .
 I have bought the Chocolate before and was satisfied . The Strawberry had a really bad flavor and I was unable to use it . Had to throw it away . Do n't waste your money on the Strawberry .
 I would have given this 3 or more stars for taste and mixability -LRB- is that a word ?
 I bought the coffee-flavored whey protein just to realize that it 's not just coffee FLAVORED , but rather the second ingredient is coffee . So it 's actually whey protein plus coffee . Each scoop contains 40mg of caffeine . I take 2.5 scoops , so that 's equivalent to a full cup of coffee .
 I have been trying a lot of the protein powder for after my workouts . Most of them have been chocolate . All of which have been pretty good . I really like strawberry flavor . So , I thought I would try a strawberry protein powder . Big mistake . I find myself struggling to finish the shakes . I would not buy this again . My advice , stick with the chocolate flavor .
 Terribly sweet flavor , it kind of makes me want to spit it out , it 's that terrible . I made a mistake by ordering this flavor instead of what I usually get - the Double Rich Chocolate . That one is delicious , you can mix 3 servings with 16 oz of milk and it is good . While Extreme milk is forcing me to use just 1 serving per 16 oz of milk , to be tolerable . I guess combining it with cereal or using it in some other way might make it less terrible .
 I used to buy ON 's Gold Standard for some time but for $ 50 ... will not buy it any more . No subscribe & save option - greed!Sam 's club sells 5lbs of Muscletech for $ 32 .
 ON opted out of the subscribe and save program.Now I go to COSTCO and buy Muscle Milk 's 6lb bag.I prefer ON , but for $ 6 less and a pound more of product , MM gets my money.I 'll go back to ON if they come back to Subscribe and Save .
 I 'm convinced this company has its own people put in false reviews on this product . It definitely does not mix easily without a blender or mixer , be prepared for 5mins of stirring and you 'll still end up with lots of clumps . You also can not mix this in water as it tastes awful in anything more than 3 ounces of water and even then , pretty bad . If you put the normal 6-8ounces of water , it tastes like water with a tint of chocolate . Not a good taste . . With milk , the mixing is even worse with a spoon but at least the taste vastly improves and it tastes a lot closer to chocolate milk . . Sorry , I will not buy this product again . I am still searching for a good protein shake , Twinlabs has a good one that mixes well in water or milk , but I wo n't refer it since it will put into doubt my review . I thought this one was a better buy , value wise . . But taste and hassle wise , it 's not .
 Hate the taste . I think this is the worst product I have tasted - get a different one if you can
 I took it the first couple of times with water and it tasted VERY bad ... So i then tried with milk and at first thought i would be able to drink it . . But after about the 2nd or 3rd time with milk I could n't even stand the taste it actually made me start to feel sick to my stomach ... I now have a practically unused HUGE bottle of protein and I 'll never use it again . .
 This is not acceptable . I purchased this whey because it was a good deal . I ordered it with my credit card , and have a receipt for my purchase . Why was this order cancelled ? You cancel my order , and tell me to repurchase it for 3x the price I just paid for it . This is complete false advertising . I have had great experiences with amazon for the past few years , but this is unacceptable ! Bait and switch tactics without any explanation.It is a horrible business practice to lure people in with a good price , then attempt to force them to pay a greater price for the same product.Your urgent attention to this matter would be appreciated .
 Container was open , seal had been tampered with and 1/3 of powder dumped out . I bought a NEW package of this whey protein , needless to say I was given a refund . Use caution !
 i needed my two 5 lb tubs of protein and 3 days after i ordered they cancelled my order . what kind of business entity renegs on a purchase agreement after i have already paid ? absolutely TERRIBLE ! unbelievable . who are these people ? XcessSupply should change their moniker to XcessDissatisfaction !!! if you are considering to order from this supplier i highly advise you to go with a different one . not worth the hassle . good night . i mean , come on !
 I purchase it about more than 10 bags and there are 4 bags were broken -LRB- have a hole -RRB- and the whey going out a little . I do not satisfy with it and consider stop buying it next time .
 I 've been getting the dbl chocolate until this batch of cookies and cream , which I decided to try . The chocolate is great , but I wanted to try something different . The cookies and cream is just too strong and overwhelming . I do n't really care for it straight , so I 've been trying to dilute it with chocolate syrup . Not really working all that well . My 14yr old son likes it , and I 've tried several times now to choke it down in hopes that it 'll grow on me , but it 's not working . My next batch I try out will be the vanilla .
 I 've been using Syntrax Matrix 5.0 Perfect Chocolate whey protein but because of the great reviews I figured I 'd give Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Double Rich Chocolate a try . It smelled much better so I was really excited to try it . Boy , was I dissapointed ! It tastes thin and not nearly as much like chocolate as the Syntrax product . It does n't mix as well either . I now have 5 pounds of this that I use only for making homemade protein bars because it 's basically not useable on its own . Seriously , try Syntrax Matrix 5.0 Perfect Chocolate , you 'll LOVE it . Syntrax Matrix 5.0 Perfect Chocolate is so good , you can just mix it with water and it 's great ! Try mixing Optimum Nutrition with just water and try to hold back the gag . It 's seriously that much of a difference . This is a classic case where smell does n't translate to flavor at all . All of those people saying how good this stuff tastes should try Syntrax Matrix 5.0 Perfect Chocolate . Do a double-blind test , try both with just water , try mixing both , no contest .
 I 've been using ON products for a little over a year now . For the most part , I 've been very pleased . I bought the 10 lb bag back in November because at the time , it was cheaper than the 5 lb tub . Tastes the same but as far as usign it in my shaker cup , this has been very clumpy . Tried some Syntha-6 a month ago and not once did it clump and it tastes much better . Maybe it was a fluke thing with the clumping , but this will be the last ON product I purchase for a long time .
 I have had this product before in the double chocolate and vanilla flavors , and all i can say is that this strawberrry flavor was just terrible . I could n't even mix it with other stuff to make the taste go away . Stay away from this flavor , however , the chocolate and vanilla ice cream flavors are great !
 Someone else already put down a good review discussing the use of sucralose -LRB- Splenda -RRB- . I 'm wishing I had seen that before I placed my order . My body has a bad reaction to artificial sweeteners and had I known it had sucralose in it , I would not have purchased it .
 when i opened package , i found it was not sealed , and powders were everywhere in the packaging box . thats it
 I received a 5lb . container of the Double Rich Chocolate on March 28 , 2012 . About an hour after drinking the first shake , I got sick -LRB- wo n't go into the details -RRB- . I was n't sure if it was the powder or one of the other ingredients in the shake , so I tried it again the next day . I got sick again . I paid $ 52.99 for this giant container , though , and really hoped I had n't received a bad batch . I tried it two more times and got the same results . I 've since stopped drinking it but wanted to post a warning after seeing some other recent reviews of people getting sick.I got such a big size because I 'd bought a 1lb . container in February from Amazon and really liked it . No issues with the product that time . I do n't know what 's in the 5lb . container this time , but it 's not good . I wo n't buy this product again .
 I tried out this flavor after having Chocolate flavor for a while . This Cookies and Cream flavor has a strong taste of powdered milk . If that 's your thing , then by all means .
 When I think of cookies and cream , I think of cookies and cream ice cream -- which tastes like Oreos . This tastes like fake cookie dough with too much artificial sweetener . It 's awful.Go with the chocolate flavor , it 's much better .
 GOLD STANDARD vs OTHERS
 Caramel Toffee Fudge is a bad flavor . Its smell and taste is almost nauseating . It 's very sweet , too sweet I think , but also carries a bitter taste with it . Plus , you do n't get as many servings , i.e. , the protein percentage is a bit lower than with some of the other flavors.I really like this protein product , but not in this flavor . The only other flavor I 've had is the Double Rich Chocolate and I like that one . Decent flavor , not too sweet , and no strange flavors like the caramel one . It mixes better than the Caramel Toffee Fudge . It also has a couple more servings .
 I was let down by the watered down flavor of the `` Double Rich Chocolate '' . Especially after just finishing a 5 pound container of the Extreme Milk Chocolate , which lived up to its name 100 % .
 I usually use ON 's Double Chocolate in the same line . I 've been very satisfied with that product . I do n't know why , but I decided to try something different . This is very different ! It is incredibly sweet . As well the flavor is highly artificial . I 've basically just got this sitting around . I do n't think there is any chance that I will finish it . So , time to go back to double chocolate.This product is gross .
 Was advertised as being double rich chocolate . Taste is bland with light chocolate flavor , nothing Rich about it or double either tastes alright blended with 1/2 banana or with strawberries yummy in that case , probably would not buy if I tasted it first . I had a different product that I mixed in my morning coffee and it was great . This one clumps up if mixed in a warm beverage .
 I love Optimum Nutrition gold standard whey protein . My favorite flavor is milk chocolate . I enjoy changing the flavor and sometimes buy two pound containers of mocha cappucino , cookies and cream . Right now I have an unopened new two-pound tub of caramel toffee fudge -- we 'll see how that goes.But I am working my way through a two pound tub of banana cream . I bought the banana cream because of favorable comments here on Amazon.All I can say is the banana flavor tastes like chemicals . And I paid a premium price . The banana , for no good reason , costs significantly more than my favorite flavors . 99 cents an ounce is a lot more than 66 cents an ounce , right?I will eat all the banana protein powder , cause no way would I waste thirty + bucks worth of protein powder , but it is an unpleasant , chemical taste . I ca n't figure out a way to doctor it up . If I add real frozen banana , the chemical taste still dominates . If I add cinnamon , which I enjoy in all other shakes , the chemical taste still dominates.Yuck yuck yuck on the banana.But I still love ON whey protein powder .
 Smells bad after a couple if weeks and taste is n't good . The chocolate is way better . I want buy this one again.i think they should discontinue this flavor for sure .
 Yuck . I got through about a third of this and just threw it out . Way too sweet .
 Stay away from the Optimum Nutrition Whey , Chocolate Mint flavor . It smells fantastic . But , no matter what you mix this with ; Whole Milk , Skim Milk , Ice Water , Tap water , it tastes just plain awful . I ca n't even describe it . If you do n't want to take my word for it , at least buy the smallest size available before committing to a 5 lb . tub . Now I 'm stuck with forcing this down with castor oil-like efficiency .
 I like the taste of this protein . but to be honest , after reading the ingredient list of this product , i am quite reluctant to drink it because there are so much artificial flavor in it and other chemicals . I also experienced gastric discomfort after use . I guess natural/organic ones would be better options .
 Ive had the vanilla , chocolate mint , and double chocolate . this one taste the worst of the three . Protein is probably good for you but this taste really bad . Ive had the costco brand chocolate protien shake and that taste better than this .
 I generally get Muscle Milk Chocolate , and thought I 'd try something different . Its a much bigger box , lots more servings in the box , but I ca n't stand the taste . . also the drink mix is very liquidy and leaves an almost aweful smell in the shaker sometime even after its washed.I used maybe 1/4th of it to make shakes , and now its just lying in storage and I 'm back on muscle milk.Compared to 2-3 scoops in a serving when using muscle milk , this one is 1 scoop a serving . That makes the drink less thick.Just wanted to share what I thought about this product .
 -LSB- ... -RSB- This product , while smelling very chocolaty , tastes like unsweetened baking cocoa which is n't good by any means.I 've been using protein powder for at least 7 years now and use it everyday with breakfast . I know protein powder can taste pleasant if not good . There are better products available for those who plan on using a product every day and do n't care to take the time to blend in extra ingredients as I do .
 I enjoy Optimum Nutrition products , but I think I 'll need to pass on Chocolate Coconut . I enjoyed this flavor the first 10 or so times I drank it . After a while though , it gets pretty gross and you get over the novelty . Extreme Milk Chocolate is definitely the best whey protein flavor , and it 's also the most simple tasting -- which is the best way to go in my opinion ! I still have about a 1/2 tub of this stuff , so I 'll chug it down for now ! Will be opting for Milk Chocolate the next go-around .
 I bought this because of the reviews here and on Bodybuilder.com . I am familiar with protein shakes and I know they are not created equal . I typically get vanilla so I can mix it with other things . I could not stomach the flavor of this . I tried it three different times . The first time in a fruit smoothie . Using same ingredients I typically use for a smoothie , it tasted weird . I could n't finish the smoothie . Thinking maybe some of the fruit was bad , I tried it again with 8 ounces of almond milk . It mixed fine in a shaker cup but tasted watered down and just ... weird . I ca n't explain it other than just saying the taste was unpleasant.I tried it one last time with just 5 ounces of almond milk . Still gross . My son said it tasted like rancid pudding . I wound up giving the whole tub to my boyfriend .
 I bought the Vanilla Ice Cream based on the reviews it had and I prefer to order from amazon vs other sellers . But the taste of this product is n't great at all not sure how I would be able to finish the bottle . I just hope something is n't wrong with it because amazon is currently reviewing this item .
 I started off with the ON Platinum Whey and downgraded to Gold because I figured I would n't notice the quality and save some money . I was wrong , because it really does differ by a lot . I know most people get the Gold Standard because the Platinum is a lot more expensive . If you can make a few sacrifices in other expense areas , and instead spend more for the Platinum Whey , it 's like night and day in my opinion . The Platinum Whey tastes 10x better , it 's thicker , feels like great quality and goes down easy . I 've had family members make a Platinum shake just to drink it because they like the taste ! The Gold by comparison felt watery -LRB- even when I doubled the scoops -RRB- and tasted horrible compared to the Platinum .
 I bought this whey because it was a bit cheaper than the other ones . Never had it before now.I have mixed this flavor with water a few times and it tastes pretty nasty . -LRB- I have always mixed all my whey with water in the past -RRB- Though it 's a pain , if you mix a little vanilla ice cream , then put a splash of milk , then the whey and blend/mix it up , it tastes pretty decent.I 'm assuming its as effective in promoting rebuild of muscle fibers as any of the other gold standard whey flavors.Wouldn ' t buy it again because of the taste though .
 5 stars for quality , but 0 stars for flavor . I decided try this flavor instead of my normal Chocolate Malt . This tastes nothing like Cookies and Cream ... tastes just like coffee . The drink also gets very foamy when mixed in my BlenderBottle with water . I like Optimum Nutrition protein , just not this flavor . I 'm going back to Malt after I get through these 27 servings .
 The plastic seal was unopened but had powder all over the container when I took it out of the box . When I opened the lid the paper cover was already open . I do not know if it was already open or if it some how opened during the process of the delivery . It makes no sense why they would ship an open container . The time of shippment was good but the powder was all over the container and the second seal was open . The delivery was messy and the open cover seems suspicious , not sure if I should try it . Do n't know how much powder was suppose to be in the container because the powder was all over the container therefore , I do not know how full it was initially . In general the delivery and presentation of the product was a dissapointment .
 I do n't know whether or not I just got a bad batch but the chocolate mint flavor made me extremely sick . It took everything I had just to brush my teeth with minty toothpaste this morning . I would compare the flavor to chocolate flavored pepto .
 I 've been drinking 2 shakes/day of Optimum Nutrition for about a year now . Here 's how I 'd rate the flavors on a 10 point scale : Vanilla Ice Cream
 Avoid delicious strawberry . . It has to be one of worst tasting proteins I 've had . . The chocolates -LRB- extreme milk and double rich -RRB- , creamy french vanilla , cookies and cream taste pretty good ... Going to try rocky road next . . Update
 I just want buyers to have fair warning that the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor tastes absolutely awful . I 've been trying to choke it down for about a week - thinking maybe I 'd warm up to it or find a way to tolerate it - and I officially give up.First off it does not dissolve well , which is something I 've heard as a positive for the brand in general . Nope , not this flavor . No matter how much liquid or the method of blending there 's always thick floaties and residue . That 's even with a high speed blender . It 's gritty , and worse - if you try to mix it with a spoon or shaker bottle you 'll get big clumps that stick to your teeth like cotton candy.Those clumps - and the drink in general - tastes awful . If you 've ever had powered milk then have the basis of the yucky flavor - add to it a sort of vitamin-esque pungency and you 've probably got a good idea where it all went wrong . At first I thought it was my creatine that i mixed in with the protein - nope . Then I tried water , milk , and even juice to try and blend it . I even tried low fat and 2 % milk to see if either made it more tolerable . Still disgusting . And you know what ? It 's not even a vanilla flavor - you sort of a `` cream '' that I do n't associate with vanilla at all . I 'd say it 's more like almost pancake mix . . not sweet , not really flavored , just kinda of chalky and gritty with that weird pungent chemical taste . . Maybe described as like if you took Bisquick powder , added water , and tried to drink it.I regularly drink protein shakes so it 's not like I 'm adverse to them in general . I trust the reviews of the other flavors and the nutritional value , but the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor was just awful .
 I was pretty happy with the Double Rich Chocolate flavor , so I decided to branch out slightly into Extreme Milk Chocolate , unaware that Ashton Kutcher was waiting in the next room to run out and yell `` Sucralose 'd !!! '' The sweetener is overwhelming and gross , -LRB- Double Rich Chocolate does n't have it -RRB- . The website has no indication which flavors have sucralose and which use other sweeteners , so I 'm afraid to try any other new variations . If anyone can report other non-sucralose flavors , I 'd greatly appreciate it .
 I bought the coffee-flavored whey protein just to realize that it 's not just coffee FLAVORED , but rather the second ingredient is coffee . So it 's actually whey protein plus coffee . Each scoop contains 40mg of caffeine . I take 2.5 scoops , so that 's equivalent to a full cup of coffee .
 I 've been a customer of Optimum Nutrition for quite some time now and I have always been trying new flavors . I have to say that I 've tried at least 7 different flavors now and this one has been the WORST . It tastes absolutely horrible . The only good thing about it was the fact that it was optimum nutrition so I knew it was good protein and it mixed really well ... Or was it ? When I received my package the plastic wrap was sealed but when I opened the jar the stay fresh seal was slightly open.EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE TASTE . Had to force myself to drink this one when I was MORE that happy to drink all the others .
 This stuff tastes really really bad , especially of you tasted the Platinum Whey before . I found it hard to consume , simply from a taste perspective.-r
 The protein that I received did not have a protective seal on it , that is required by law . I am assuming that it was taken off so that I would not be able to return it . Not using my best judgement I tried the protein anyways . I tried a scoop of the protein after my workout . It make me sick to my stomach and light headed like I was gon na vomit . This lasted about 2 hours . This did n't make since because I was having a great day and a great workout . I have tried this ON protein in the past with no complaints . I think the protein was either contaminated with something or spoiled . I think the sender is trying to get rid of this bad product and knows if they send it without the protective seal then whoever receives it can not return it , per the amazon return policy .
 I am fully willing to accept that this might have been a 1-off experience , but I wanted to leave it here for anyone else that maybe had the same experience.I 've been using ON 's Whey Vanilla Protein for over a year , specifically the older 2 lbs container that Amazon no longer carried when I went to order it . Instead I got this 5 lbs container.In the past my experience with ON 's Whey Protein was that it tasted very `` gentle '' -- it was an easy protein powder to mix into anything and not taste . I mixed it with milk or water by itself and would take it before and after a workout.After I got the new 5 lbs tub , I did my same routine and took my shake before my workout . I was struck with how chalky and noticeable the taste was . The taste of the new protein was much more pronounced . It 's not a pungent taste , just a nasty sort of chalky taste.I went and worked out and came home and had my 2nd shake that was even more pronounced . I could n't get that taste off my palette for about a day and ended up tossing the entire tub of protein.I do n't know if anyone else has noticed the more pronounced taste , but I 've moved to another protein powder just because I personally can not stand it . If you are using this and continue to notice no taste and everything is fine , it 's very possible I just got a bad/unmixed batch of protein or something.Other than that , it 's hard to beat the price of the ON Protein , which is what has always attracted me to it on Amazon .
 I 've tried all 17 Optimum flavors and they are NOT the best tasting . I like protein shakes that taste like a dessert with absolutely zero `` protein shake '' taste . The only flavor I could enjoy a little was `` Mocha Cappuccino '' , because the bitter coffee after taste masked the `` protein shake '' taste.If you 're picky and not liking Optimum either , I suggest trying Wellements Pro-Rate Vanilla Cream . It is the only protein shake I can truly enjoy . Do n't get the Wellements chocolate flavor , I only had one scoop of the entire 6lbs bag and had to give it away to my ex - ... Yuck.My tongue works very well and yes , I am very picky .
 They canceled my order for no reason . This company does n't care about the customer . They just want to make money . They suck . Do n't buy from them or you 'll regret it .
 Ordered two 5lbs tubs of Optimum Nutrition on Thursday , and I get an email from Amazon today how they canceled to order . Do not buy from them .
 First off , the product itself is amazing , the quality and the taste , I know it , it 's not the first time I purchase it . But if only ON knew what Amazon does to their reputation!The item arrived perfectly sealed . Outside . It was much later when I found out that the inside protection was damaged , and the weight was also all wrong . The 5-pound bottle weighed 1 lb less!Beware !
 I 've had this product many times before and I love the taste . This 5 pound bucket is just plain bad and I 'm stuck with it .
 I have used this product on a consistent basis for years . However , the primary problem is that it can be shipped in an almost spoiled condition . By that I mean it either becomes somewhat malodorous very soon or it can cause stomach cramps . Neither is good . While the product might be very good at a good price when fresh the whole idea does not work when it makes you sick . I am switching to Muscle Milk
 I ordered the Cake Batter flavor . I figured it was time to try something new after having used both GROW Whey , and BSN Syntha-6 -LRB- both of which are awesome -RRB- . I should not have dared it this time though.This stuff tastes like S#@% . It mixes fairly well in both milk and water ... but the mixing is not the problem . It 's the gagging and choking which ensue after you start drinking it.Trust me on this and buy BSN Syntha-6 instead of this crap .
 I have gotten the strawberry banana flavor before , and it was awesome . The price is good too . However , they sent me chocolate mint instead . I would of sent it back , but I was lazy and curious about the flavor . It 's not terrible , but I wish I had gotten what I ordered . Strawberry banana is much better .
 The shipping is terrible . It kept me waiting for weeks . Whenever I called them , I was told that no information is available and I need to wait patiently.It totally disrupted my work out plan .
 I ordered the 100 % whey protein in free shipping -LRB- 5-9 days -RRB- , hoping to get it within 10 days.But it took more than -LRB- -RRB- @ # * $ @ two weeks to arrive.I would definitely buy this kind of stuff at local store from now on .
 I tried a free sample of this flavor that was included in my order . It was the most miserable experience of my life .
 This is by far the worst protein ive ever had !!! Its taste is unbearable , it smells like cow poo , when you use it in a shaker cup it comes out clumpier than my poop after eating a pound of cottage cheese , makes you more bloated than a pregnant woman , and works worse than a old man with ED trying to get laid . Bottom line this stuff sucks . Dont waste your money ! P.S. the only reason it got 1 star is because amazon doesnt let you give negative stars .
 It seems healthy untill you read on the ingredients list ... ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR ... . What the hell . !!!! Artificial stuff is the cause of most Illnesses and diseases ... . Healthy Foods dont come ARTIFICIALLY . !!!! Try hemp protein that contains RAW ORGANIC HEMP . Protein , Amino acids , Zinc , Magnesium . !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GO HEMP GO HEMP ... NOT ARTIFICIAL STUFF ... ATRIFICIAL KILLS .
 this product has so many wrongs , that is so difficult to start to review it.do not take this if you want to keep living ... I got so sick and swollen from taking it for 3 days only.I did some research on it and found out that it has ingredients that produce cancer ... yess cancer !!!! and I also found out that the immediate effects of muscle growth is nothing more than the extreme excess amount of glutamine that just makes your body retain water.it is poor in taste -LRB- looks and tastes like dirty water -RRB- to put it in simple terms ... it is junk.don ' t waste your money here .
 I 'm very disappointed about this product . I would never purchase this band again .
 I bought the Cruzer3 with the intention of only occasionally using it . I 've used it only a handful of times and it 's already falling apart , wo n't hold a charge , and the foil already has huge holes in it.What a waste of money .
 I have an aincent Norelco with spinning blade heads that does a much better job than this thing did out of the box , even though my old shaver has blades which have been in it for a few years . I needed a new razor since the battery is almost toast on that old thing . The Cruzer3 has a lot of power , but it just wants to vibrate its way across the room . It takes a long time to get a good shave with this , and my hand was numb by the time I was done . The screen is no good at picking up longer hairs -- admittedly more comfortable than the snagging that my old razor sometimes does , but the vibration far outweighed that benefit .
 This is supposedly an all-in-one product with the trimmer and a shaver . In reality , it does n't work.First thing I noticed was that the guard comb is very flimsy . It has a simple selector that allows you to change the length of the comb.It does n't work
 well to be honest , I took my chances while purchasing this product , after reading all the bad reviewsI took it basically for trimming and it doesnt work.Totally useless product , its all the hype , totally not worth it
 If you really need something better , buy the cruzer 4 2838 . It is n't sold in the USA but you can find it online . Twice the price of the 2865 , but 10 times better . Check it !
 I was very dissapointed , i was under the impression that this thing would trim beards effectivelly . I think I have better using a pair of sissors to trim my bear!This product gets 2 rabbles
 As soon as I tried it I wanted to return it . I had a 5-day beard , the shaver would fail to cut most of it , only small spots were shaved . After 10 minutes going over and over it , the result was horrible . I gave up and used my razor.It just does not work .
 Does n't give a smooth close shave . Takes twice as long to get shaven as it does with my Remington.The trimmer is virtually useless.Very disappointed because Braun has the reputation of producing quality items . This is not one of them !
 I wanted a second Braun for travel . The price of this one was amazing -LRB- under $ 40 -RRB- so I thought I 'd try it . Well , you get what you pay for . The shave is very poor ; takes several passes over a spot to do what a normal priced Braun can do in a single pass . This thing actually cut me too ; I 've used various Brauns now for over 10 years and none has ever cut me -LRB- unless the foil was torn , of course -RRB- . For travel , there 's no lock -LRB- as another reviewer pointed out -RRB- , which is a horrible design choice ; this razor could easily turn on while in your suitcase . It also does not come with a case of any kind -LRB- very odd -RRB- . The trimmer is useful , and that 's pretty much all I use it for now . -LRB- And , it 's ugly , but who really cares -RRB- . I basically gave it to my 17 year old , and even he says it 's annoying to use compared to mine , and he 's got like 9 facial hairs.For under $ 40 , it 's tolerable . But if you really need to use a razor regularly , lay down the $ 80 - $ 120 for a better model . Braun really should not put their name on this model ; their other products are in a different quality category .
 I bought this item for my husband , he had an old Norelco that worked great but was not charging anymore . His main complaint with the Braun is that it will not shave his neck , but it does fine with his face . I did read other reviews that had similar complaints , and I wish I had listened and bought something different . I hope this is helpful .
 This shaver did not live up to my expectations from reading other reviews.I have used a remington microscreen foil shaver for over 20 years -LRB- 2 different units -RRB- and thought I would try something different . Big mistake ! This Braun looks nice , feels nice but that 's it . It takes at least 5 minutes to repeatedly go over my face to finally cut all the hair down to a decent close shave . My old razor would do it in under 2 minutes . Hopefully my regret will not be yours also .
 Do n't be fooled by posts from those needing just a beard trimmer . Listen to those who really SHAVE with this razor.My previous Braun razors were all great . When the foil hit your face - you knew hair was really being cut . Not so the Cruzer.This razor 's foil has woefully tiny holes - all arranged in a spoke-wheel pattern - which actually prevents hair from being properly channeled into the blades.I first thought the foil head was n't seated properly . It was - to my disappointment . Then I tried shaving with water & gels - with only minor improvement . After shaving 3 times longer than necessary , I finally got a mediocre shave -LRB- and a nice skin rash the following day -RRB- . Braun 's vaunted foil-design fails in spades - and my beard just is n't that tough.Don ' t get me wrong , no electric razor shaves like a blade - but come on.I tried sending my concerns to Braun on their website which is complete with slick videos but with little functionality for speaking directly to `` Star Base Command '' . Sort of like their recent products , flashy and colorful but unresponsive . So here I am on Amazon.com.As an ex manufacturing engineer - I feel this is just plain old marketing dept interference with engineering , or simply engineers intoxicated by their own design philosophy . Probably a bit of both.I loved my old Braun razors , but this just is n't the same company anymore.Braun needs to get back to basics . Had their engineers used this product at home for a few weeks before committing to the design , they would have spotted this turkey in a minute.This problem spans ALL their shavers using this flawed foil pattern , so do n't be tempted to buy the next model up -LRB- $ $ $ -RRB- unless it has a totally different design . It wo n't help.Braun can EASILY FIX this by offering a replacement foil with a REDESIGNED pattern at nominal cost WITHOUT REPLACING THE WHOLE RAZOR . You 'd just snap it on - and be out of the woods . But since they seem beyond the reach of customer feedback and will never see this message - you 'll be looking like you just came out of the woods for some time to come.Which brings me to my second gripe - Braun is FAMOUS for changing its razor designs so frequently - that you never know what you 're getting into when you trade up . They 're losing their audience - and loyal customers are going elsewhere.The boys in marketing strike again.Rob in Riyadh .
 I guess this is what happens when a company gets too big . It sits back on its laurels and outsources to China.First off , the electric shaver it was replacing was a Japanese `` national '' brand battery operated single rotary head shaver that was smaller than the palm of your hand , yet lasted over twenty years of daily use , including travel , camping , a good many drops , and a couple of accidental submersions . Purchased in Japan back in 1987 , it always shaved close , never nicked or irritated , did its job in under two minutes , and cost less than $ 20 -LRB- adjusted Yen to Dollar -RRB- . Now to Braun 's cruZer Z-50 ; reputable Braun name , rechargeable foil shaver with loads of gadgets for sideburn / beard grooming , all for under $ 50 . A bit pricey , but seemed like it would make a fine replacement shaver.Wrong ! After charging it up , as per the instructions , I tried shaving the one day old growth and did n't notice any difference . I still had all the same stubble stuck to my face instead the shaver . Blade to the rescue while reviewing the instructions at work to try and figure out if I did anything wrong . Next morning disassembled / reassembled the shaver to check that it was working properly and wound up with the same results . Over the course of the following couple weeks , I tried hot wet electric shaving , electric shaving with creams and gels , spending ten freakin ' minutes doing a two minute job , combining all of the above - all with the same dismally disappointing results , but with varying levels of rash streaks on my cheeks and neck - and still having to go back over with a blade razor daily.In the end , I was donated -LRB- Yes , DONATED by a work colleague -RRB- a 2nd hand , `` 2nd rate '' Norelco rotory . The Norelco works , the Braun does not , and I can not replace my old national that bit the dust . I will not speak of Braun 's more expensive model shavers as I have a friend who speak well of his , but as for my future backing of Braun products , I think I 'll stick to their Formula 1 race cars and skip on their shavers .
 Bought this as my first electric shaver.After spending a frustrating 20 minutes trying to shave 3-day old stubble , only to find it had only shaved a few patches , returned to the instruction manual , assuming I must be doing something wrong . Re-read , attempted again , same problem . Read these reviews and realised that this shaver is , essentially , a waste of money . For an item that touts itself on its flexibility , this is nothing short of a rip-off .
 This shaver is a big disappointment ! It takes more to shave with it than with foam and blade ... Shaving quality is low , even if you patiently try to cut all the beard that is left by the main razor with the trimmer .
 I hate this machines they work only for couple of months and then cause a lot of wounds while shaving and not practical at all
 I usually shave with my Mach 3 razor . I decided to buy the Braun Cruzer 3 , and got it home , and tried to shave with it . After going over the same area of beard like 10 times , I realized that there was still stubble . This thing just does n't cut , and I do n't want to stand there for 15 minutes , trying to get a close shave from it . I am sorry I bought this . It is a waste of money . Get a Mach 3 instead , and a beard razor , like the ones Panasonic makes .
 I saw this shaver in few ads and I really liked the way it looked and was impresed it had shaver trimmer and shaper in it.Well only until I opened the box and tried it for the first -LRB- and last -RRB- time ! It took me over 30 minutes to shave half of my face and it still left a lot of places with plenty of hair on them . Btw i also tried the shaper which didnt work at all!the only thing it does well is look good in the box !
 it is not an easy to use device , I have tried to trimm my beard and goatee with it but always have to shave it all , i have never had good results with it.The shave function is worst , I have a heavy beard and it always let my face with spots , it is not easy to use .
 Great idea . Bad quality . It has some issues cutting long hair but you have the trimmer/whatever . Well , tonight the trimmer chocked and died on me on my beard . Basically the blades got enough `` hair inside '' that something got suck and stopped moving . I have had this product for about 4-6 months.Sorry but if a product is aimed at trimming beards/goatees , etc also , I expect it to work * and last * . Did n't . Went back to my Norelco for a second to finish my shave -LRB- it runs low on batteries even at full charge for being old -RRB- and I was surprised how much better even in non-trimmer mode it grabbed longer hair.My disappointment is that Norelco does n't make an `` all in one '' product like this anymore . They charge high , but I have to say , they work better , and I think this is the first and last Braun shaving product I buy.Hint to Braun
 design seems great ... but does not shave very close , even the trimmers seem a little dull . . disappointed
 I purchased this shaver as a Christmas gift for my husband thinking I was getting quite a deal for my money . The washable and worldwide voltage features are definitely a huge plus . Also , the 5 minute quick charge feature - for a man who ALWAYS forgets to plug the darn thing in until 5 minutes before he has to shave - seem a perfect fit . Unfortunately , all the impressive extras in the world do n't really amount to much when the main function of the device - giving a close and comfortable shave - does n't work . According to my husband , it 's jumpy , clunky and leaves stubble and clumps of hair where you 're meant to have a clean cut.If you 're looking for a shaver for yourself or the man in your life , I 'd recommend looking elsewhere . You 'd probably be better off with a 20 shaver and a separate trimmer that actually work , rather than this fancy machine that ca n't even perform its basic task .
 It seems that you always have to avoid all in one solutions , they keep doing everything bad
 I was attracted to this razor because of its multi-functionality , but dont buy it unless you want to spend forever in the bathroom trying to trim up ... This thing is the most inefficient trimming device I have ever seen .
 I have been using this razor for 1 month . Takes about 20 minutes to get an unclean shave . Trimmer does n't trim very well . Plus , foil makes it difficult to see what your shaping
 As nifty as it looks , this razor is surprisingly second-rate . Unlike my previous Braun razor -LRB- from 1999 -RRB- , this shaver does n't even have a ` lock ' setting . And since the on-button is very touch-sensitive , it 's practically a guarantee that it 'll accidentally go off in your luggage . Whose idea was that?Also , I find I have to go over the same area several times for it to be shaved to my satisfaction . Sure , it has a beard trimmer -LRB- which I barely use -RRB- , but lots of other , assuredly better razors have them too . Without the sucking .
 Another reviewer rated the closeness as fair.I would have to agree as it was not anywhere close to good.But , I got this shaver to trim my beard.It does not trim beards at all . Facial hair can not reach the micro-screen . It may be a good gift if you hate someone.I will be returning mine , as it does a bad job as a shaver , and does not trim beards.I am very dissapointed now since I 've been waiting for a while to get one and received this as a gift . It was hard to tell the giftor that it did n't work . Do n't waste your time with this shaver .
 Great features if they worked!I had a Braun before that worked great and thought I would be safe buying another . Not so . ThisWas a wasted 60 bucks . Takes me twice as long to shave after going over each area of my face several times -LRB- and my facial hair is not thick -RRB- . I regret not returning it every time I shave . If you buy Braun make sure it is one of the more expensive models .
 I picked this up hoping to use it a few times a week and keep a short beard . What I got was a pain in the neck . Unless you want to keep a lumberjack length beard , this is not the trimmer for you . The attachments do not give you a close trim and the razor itself only worked for about 4 months before it started cutting me through the foil . And I 'm not even talking through holes in the foil . I come away from using the razor with scrapes all over my face on a daily basis . Save your money and invest in a higher quality product .
 I did n't get so lucky enough to have read the customer reviews and I ordered 2 of them thinking I was getting 10 batteries ! I am now fighting with Amazon over this , asking them to right the issue by sending me the 10 batteries and fixing the picture . I think I 'm talking to someone in India , so we 'll see how far I get ...
 Be careful when you order this item ! One of the pictures shown tells you it is not the actual item and shows a single battery , the other picture available shows a card of 5 batteries . They actually only send out ONE individual battery , not a card of five .
 This is a review of the `` Maxell Battery Cr2016 '' offer , as offered by MyBatterySupplier . I did not order this item but consider myself a `` customer '' for purposes of this Customer Review because I did carefully consider buying it -- just as I am a customer when I enter a brick-and-mortar store , whether I make a purchase or not.Please note that the 3 reviews that were written before mine date from 2006 . Now , in 2012 , the description states plainly that what one is ordering is a 5-pack of batteries . But I have no idea whether I would get 5 batteries or 1 battery , due to the refusal of the seller to state what he/she is selling . Please read the Description , which I quote here from the Web page as it exists today : `` Maxell CR2016 5-Pack 3V Lithium Coin Cell Batteries Maxell CR2016 5-Pack 3V Lithium Coin Cell Batteries FA EA-50CF / 3D AWI L10 Duracell DL2016 , DL2016B Eveready ECR2016 Kodak KCR2016 Maxell CR2016 NEDA 5000LC Panasonic CR2016 Sanyo CR2016 Toshiba CR2016 Varta CR2016 `` Come on , folks ! Are you selling Maxell batteries ? Duracell ? Eveready ? Panasonic ? Sanyo ? Toshiba ? Varta ? I lose all faith in a sellers who will not be pinned down as to what they is really offering . So I see a picture of 5 batteries and I see a description stating `` 5-pack '' , but the wriggly , squirmy description of what is being sold leaves me with no confidence in this seller.I 'm saving my money for a seller who is clear and definite about the product being sold . I hope you will , too . Amazon does not need sellers who act this way.edelran
 Um ... 10.95 ? Rather expensive do n't you think?I bought a can of this for 1.50 in the store.Great stuff though , I give the product itself 5 stars . This price is ridiculous however . .
 The zombie flavor is just gross . The chap stuck its selfs is smooth and nice but I could n't get over the smell of this flavor .
 It does n't taste or smell like Grand Marnier I was very disappointed . I would rather have my chapstick in cherry flavor . Atleast It has a taste .

 you should all notice that it doesnt spin if you touch your teeth using normal pressure . it only spins when it is very very lightly touching the teeth . this makes this brush useless .
 Having evaluated several electric toothbrushes recently , I find that the actual cleaning action of this toothbrush ranks at the very bottom.It 's noisier than other electrics , the round bottom is an awful `` innovation '' since that means that it has to lay flat on a counter or in a cabinet , taking up much more space than necessary and risking getting knocked on the floor when the countertop gets crowded . But that 's not why I would n't recommend this brush.Fundamentally , I simply did n't feel that it cleaned my teeth very well . I had to use more force than I should have to clean around my gums and the second row of bristles with the up-down motion proved nearly useless . Only the rotating top portion was effective.The one thing that the Oral B has going for it is that it has a better motor than most of the electrics that I 've tried . For example , the plastic junctions in a Colgate electric toothbrush skip as soon as I apply any pressure to the bristles and it actually stops from the friction while I 'm cleaning my back teeth . The Oral B neither skips nor stops while I 'm brushing . It simply does n't clean very well.I think that you 're better off with a an old fashioned medium-bristle manual toothbrush than this electric . If you must buy an electric , look for one with two revolving heads . The cross-action is not very effective .
 My Oral B CrossAction was good for a while ... and then it seems that manufacturing of the brush head went down in quality . The brush head started coming loose and move up and down as the brush was spinning . This pinched and hurt my lips.Sure , it is inexpensive , and it probably is a good product for the price ... but in that case , I would opt for the Oral B D-4 toothbrush .
 I bought this as a spare for travel . It is huge , bulky , and barely vibrates . I wo n't replace it when the batteries run out .
 This is the worst toothbrush ever . It is very , very , very loud and the brushing is hard , course and irritating . I used it for a week and then gave up .

 I ordered both this 10X -LRB- sold recently on the Bernard Jensen site , but they sold out -RRB- & the 5X -LRB- after reading the other review & seeing the 5X was pretty inexpensive -RRB- . For iridology , if you need something inexpensive , go with the 5X . When you look at the iris , the light is pointed in the correct direction to give you a magnification of the entire iris under light.This 10X , however does not ... it distorts it & is only good for looking up close at a small part of the iris ... you will not be able to see the entire iris in one view , magnified & illuminated with this tool!If you need something inexpensive for iridology , skip the 10X & go with the 5X ... you 'll at least be able to see ! But if you have the $ $ get the $ 50 welch allyn pen light on amazon & purchase a separate lens with 8x mag .
 This magnifier is powerful but poorly made.The is significant distortion in the corners and along the edges leaving only the center of the lens useful and if the available light is n't enough you 're out of luck . When what you 're looking at is in focus the built-in light is n't shinning on it.I 'd have returned it as useless except that there are times when the ambiant light is enough to use this magnifier without needing it 's built-in light.As a reminder of how useless the built-in light was I took the magnifier apart and removed all the light 's parts . I 'll use them as spares for the 5x version which works well and it 's light is properly aimed .
 I bought the lite to use for Iridology . I was unable to see very well with it for this purpose .
 I used the generic CVS brand the first time with absolutely no problems . Purchased Dulcolax and had the same intense pain as earlier reviewers . I thought I was going to faint the first time and had cold sweats . I attributed the pain to possibility of food poisoning as we had been out for dinner that evening . Took the pill a second time and pain not as intense but severe cramps . Definitely not a mild laxative . I tried one more time , took it last night , had same severe cramps at 3 in the morning and still have `` runs '' to the bathroom and it is 11 am.Everyone is different and I believe the reviewer that recommended taking it early in the day as a trial has a valid point . It is an effective laxative for some but for others it is to be avoided .
 I was looking for a mild stool softener to help me through my high protein diet . Hhmm , however decided to write on the label that it 's gentle and `` predictable '' should take a few pills himself . I was on the toilet for an hour just 2 hours after taking this , and a full day later , and I am not venturing far from home . I have been cramping and miserable for about 24 hours now .
 I 've had 4 wisdom teeth removed , gave birth to three children , had two fillings and one root canal . The pain I experienced from this product beat all of the above by a long shot . It works , but if you 're on death 's door does it really matter ? Stay away !!!!
 This product may be tried and true by alot of people , but I will never again in life use this ! The severe cramping I endured along with the nausea and profuse sweating was one of the worst experiences in my life . I thought I would eventually pass out . I read the instructions and followed them through . I had plenty to drink as well . It did n't matter . These little pills are just mean and nasty . It is not worth the pain and misery . I will stick with Phillips Milk of Magnesia .
 Sent me the wrong package , not the one that was pictured . Did not work as well & why did come fron England & not the ones I usually get .
 I used to write reviews but now I ca n't be bothered unless it 's to warn people . like now . this is the most disgusting `` natural '' line out there , which is saying a lot because they are countless . I use truly natural products , so I knew I was n't going to use this , bought it only for the container for my real product . I just needed a big , cheap container for it . funnily enough the thing stunk so harshly from chemicals , even the stupid container was worthless . I bought both this and the handsoap for containing purposes only but threw both in the bin . throwing money in the bin is so fun . this one just smelled like the regular toxic pinesol in the grocery store - so if that 's what you want in a natural product , then this one wo n't bother you . however , even people who do n't mind mainstream products would hate the handsoap - was UNBELIEVABLE - literally smelled like america 's seniors ' homes - if you do n't believe me , buy it . EVERYTHING not to be put in natural products was in these products

 Purchased this as a novelty item but my honey wanted to try it out on me . While the ` act ' was wonderful as always , the gel added nothing at all -LRB- except for an interruption while she spat the excess out -RRB- . Oh well .
 I was reading high at home . I almost called the EM Room to see if I should come in . Took it to the doctor and found it will read over 20 to 25 mmHg Systolic and over 10 mmHg Dastolic higher than it should . Easy to use and self storage .
 This product is horrible . From the day I bought it , it always gave excessively high blood pressure readings . The batteries never exceed more than 2 usages . I recommend people to buy from a different manufacturer or brand name .
 I am an active older individual -LRB- 64 -RRB- with a heart that is prone to an irregular hearbeat , even atrial fibrillation . I felt this was a godsend for someone of my condiition and who was not ready to become totally sedentary . It worked as advertised for a while but would occasionally refuse to inflate and return an Err -2 . Until today , I could just try it again and it would work fine . Well today , it just stopped inflating at all . All I get is an Err -2 and the instructions say contact the retailer . I would like to exchange it for one that works but it failed not quite 60 days after purchase . However , after I little determined digging I finally found the right button to push . I got an almost immediate exchange , have received my new one and all is sweetness and light again . I 'd change the rating to 4 stars but wo n't let me .
 I am suppose to be receiving a refund because I have done sent it back but I have not heard anything from ya 'll .
 This BP Monitor was accurate for about the first 2 weeks of use . BP from monitor checked closely with manual BP . After the first 2 weeks , got very inaccurate results dispite replacing the batteries . I can not rely on this monitor for my patient 's B/P results .
 I purchased this item about 4 days ago , and even though I have high standard , arm blood pressure monitor , I wanted something compact and small . From the first reading , this monitor was erroneous in its numbers . VERY HIGH 160/101I measured my blood pressure again , numerous times , compared it with the high quality arm monitor , and it read 135/82 . This kind of reading can be alarming to someone who does not compare the faulty reading to another instrument . I AM RETURNING THIS PRODUCT ASAP > do not buy this item ,
 The item was going to be late to arrive , and customer service overnighted it so it would arrive for my trip . BUT . This item is crunchy sounding and not the soft item I have seen in stores , I can live with it but , it was supposed to be a gift for my husband and he hates it .
 I bought it for comfortable sleeping on airplane . However , this pillow is soft and it just lies on your shoulder . You neck has to bend so as to reach it . The other drawback is it occupies a lot of space in my bag.I will definitely buy a inflating pillow in the future .
 I did n't find this one to be very comforting during my travels to oversea . the pillow wraps around your neck and it made me get so hot and sweaty , I could n't get any sleep during the 14 hour flight -LRB- I 'm sure there were other factors involved in my insomnia -RRB- . If you 're looking for a travel pillow , perhaps a travel pillow made with more breathable , vented material would do a better job .
 I would not recommend this pillow at all ! I just received mine in the mail yesterday and I have already thrown it away . First , the pillow was dirty . I ordered the celadon pillow and when I opened it there were all these dark gray splotches on the top of the pillow . I took the removable cover off and realized the discoloration was caused by the filling . The lining between the pillow cover and the filling is a really flimsy white fabric , which led to the discoloration . I decided that I would wash the cover when I got a chance , so I put the pillow and the cover back in the box with the other stuff I ordered . When I went back through the box a few hours later , the gritty stuff , whatever it is , that makes up the filling got all over everything in the box . I brushed it all off with my hands , which was a mistake . I do n't know what that filling is made of , but it felt like fiberglass . I would pick something else up and there would be little stings on my hands from the filling I touched . Even after scrubbing my hands , some of the filling remained . Additionally , the combination of the scent satchel in the pillow pocket and the gritty filling caused a sneezing attack .
 I wear this type of splint to bed at night due to my carpal tunnel , my old splints bought at a medical supply store were getting pretty yucky after 3 years of use , so I figured I 'd replace them . Picture wise these looked identical to the ones I had . They are much lower quality.First , the metal splint is inserted into a slot that has no way of securing it at hte bottom , so it slips out . The velcro straps wrap around and adhere to the hook strip , but the strip is sewn all the way to the bottom edge and the hooks irritate my skin there as they poke through the edging . I applied medical tape over that section just to make the splint wearable . Lastly , the stretchy fabric inside the splint is rather tight , making the splint feel tight even if the straps are n't taught , however that part I 've gotten fairly used to.After using these about a month , I 'm going to have to go back to my old ones because they have worn a sore spot on my forearm from the hook and loop and I 'll probably go to a medical supply store to buy my next pair .

 Thought I was getting something to serve as a breath mint equivalent . Instead these are mildly flavored powdered sugar that last a few seconds and do nothing more that give a sugar rush . I bought 3 flavors , a case each . Do n't waste your money .

 I put one of these up in our kitchen , and another near the cat litter tray in our spare room . It has n't made a difference in either places . I will not be buying this product again .
 The zombie flavor is just gross . The chap stuck its selfs is smooth and nice but I could n't get over the smell of this flavor .
 It does n't taste or smell like Grand Marnier I was very disappointed . I would rather have my chapstick in cherry flavor . Atleast It has a taste .
 When I bought this I was thrilled at getting a 5 in 1 piece of equipment at a great price . But slowly my enthusiasm waned . Its too long to fit comfortably in my pocket , the finish could have been better . Finally the disk shaped attachment at the end of tuning fork broke loose and now I do n't use it anymore . Inferior product at cheap price .
 The product is badly crafted . . comes apart . It is too light to work as a good tendon hammer ... you should n't be using the same pin on everyone and I am nearly positive the tuning fork does not vibrate at the said frequency ... very bad product ... do not be tempted by the 5 in 1 thing ... its useless !
 It sounds like perfect instrument , 5 functions in 1 , but it is USELESS . The product is very cheaply made and everything came off . Shouldnt worth more than $ 1 to 3 .
 Item does everything as pictured . Just not machined nicely , pretty big and bulky . Not going in my lab coat pocket .
 Screw in pieces tend to rattle around when using the tuning fork and taking them out does n't help because the pinwheel is also vibrates . The device still performs the job , just felt and sounded like a CHEAP device .
 The tea may be fine , but I 'm warning you this company will rob you on shipping and handling . They charged $ 5.20 S&H for a box of tea that weighed 1.09 oz . That 's almost as much as the tea cost ! Amazon , I wouldnt have them on your web site .

 This was not anything like it was avertised . It arrived stuffed in a zip lock bag in a mailing envelope . There was no box , the product actually looked used and I am VERY disappointed .
 With the great reviews I ordered this over a month before Christmas . Did I get it ? NO . Two days before Christmas I get a note that this is no longer available from Nutricity , despite their page saying they are in stock and can ship immediately . VERY UNHAPPY Christmas for the family involved .
 This item says that it is a good supplement for a vegetarian or vegan diet . It contains Marine Fish Oil Concentrate . Do not buy this if you are vegetarian or vegan . And please , Being Well at Hillcrest , fix the product description . There is nothing vegetarian about this product . The description is deceptive and misleading .
 I read an article that this would help relieve pains in my body . It did nothing to ease the pain.Betty
 Because celery is on the dirty dozen list , why would anyone put a concentrated amount of conventional celery in their body . I fully believe in the benefits of celery as I do many other natural , God given foods , but in the case of celery it must be organic for me .
 I purchased this product for my seven year old who has not been dry more than one night at a time since birth . Purchasing an alarm as an alternative to medication was highly recommended by our pediatrician . Prior to this point we have tried no liquids several hours before bedtime , waking him up in the middle of the night , etc. . Needless to say , we were cautiously hopefull . Unfortunately , the alarm has been very inconsistent . Some nights the alarm sounds , and I am able to assist my son to the bathroom , other nights he wakes up with a wet pull-up and the alarm has n't made a peep all night . This has been frustrating primarily because my son began to make progress in response to the alarm and started getting up on his own when the alarm sounded . At one point , he was even dry for a period of five days . The inconsistency of the alarm has really hampered progress and we are looking into a more reliable product .
 I purchased the Dri-sleeper for my son hoping it would help him . We told him how much this would help him and it barely worked for 3 days . He was unbelievably upset at how it failed over and over . I realized the main unit had an intermittent connection and tried to explain it to the help line . They kept insisting the main unit was fine and only the sensor needed replacement . In fact they repeated the line from the on-line documentation stating `` the sensor is a wearable item and should be replaced from time to time '' . Are you kidding !! How ridiculous is that ! I repeated that the main unit had a specific fault condition but the help line would NOT replace it . At this point we do not have a functioning bed wetting alarm for my son . My son , wife and I are very discouraged with this experience and think the Dri-sleeper product should be removed from Amazon !!
 No complaints about the merchant , packaging , delivery.No noticeable effects from the product however . Experimented with different doses , etc. . Nothing at all .
 This product is one of the latest reported to help male problems . For me , it caused nightmares/odd dreams . It could be that it does n't mix well with another supplement that I 'm using .
 I used this together with Muira Puama which is commonly recommended . This is primarily promoted for libido enhancement and energy . I suppose if you have low libido and low energy this might work for you , but I naturally already have high libido and energy and just wanted to see if it could even make those better . It does n't -- in fact it works the opposite
 I have been using this product-twice a day for 3 months . I have not seen any improvement in my nails - no worse but no better . This product never dryed my skin as was stated on product description , which was good . I think this product might work for some but has no real benefit for others .

 I purchased these after having had my baby in an effort to avoid disposable nursing pads and reduce landfill waste -- the only thing I really wasted was my money . I wore these in the day and in the night , and they did n't keep me or my clothing dry at all -- and I 'm not a heavy producer . They 're bulky and uncomfortable under any bra . Another con is that you 've got to wash them pretty much immediately to avoid that spoiled breast milk smell staining them for good.I would n't recommend this product .
 I was unhappy with disposable nursing pads so I gave these a whirl . They are WAY too small , so any shifting at all renders them completely useless . I am a 38DD while nursing , so maybe these would work fine for smaller breasted women . I used them a few times at home then threw them in a drawer and have n't taken them out since . Too bad , because they absorbed pretty well the 10 % of the time they stayed in place .
 I used these pads for a few months . I have barely any leakage , and they contain minimal amount of breast milk well . I would n't recommend for moderate or heavy milk flow though . The major problem with these is no curvature . They are flat and get dislodged constantly exposing the nipples . I leaked few times on cloths on the street as well at nighttime frequently . Lace on the back does n't do anything to hold them in place . They are also visible under clothing . After several months of use the surface became rough , so they are becoming very uncomfortable . I would n't recommend these .
 Would be helpful for slight leaking but anything substantial ran over . Also the pads are visible even under a padded bra . Get something that contours to your breast instead .
 I bought these because I hate using disposables and adding to the waste problem . I 'm sure there are better washable pads out there . These are completely flat and do n't bend much to contour to your breast or nipple . They are super obvious under a thin bra or tank top . Plus , they stick to you -- not horribly but still undesirable . I like the bag that comes with them but overall , I would n't buy this product again or recommend it .
 I hate these nursing pads ! They stick to your nipples and they do n't absorb ANYTHING ! The first time I actually used them I had to take a shower immediately after because I was a total mess . Do not buy this product ! It 's a total and complete waste of money . In fact I 'm so pissed off about this that I 'm going to write the manufacturer and tell them they stole from me !
 I bought these thinking they 'd be more cost effective than throwing away disposables AND the box says that they have a leakproof back . WRONG !!!! I put them in and nursed my son and BAM , in front of our guests , I leaked through the pad , bra , my shirt AND the blanket . I contacted Avent to discuss the fact that the box is VERY misleading and they never got back with me . Go ahead and buy the cheap disposables , they do n't leak !
 I bought two packs of these in the hopes that they would work well and I would be helping the environment by avoiding the disposable pads . Like other consumers discovered , they do not hold up at night for me . Also , when my son is nursing on one side , I find that the pad on the other side quickly becomes soaked through and my shirt is soaked soon afterward . Because they are n't very absorbant , I go through them quickly -LRB- I wash the set once every other day ! -RRB- , even with 12 .
 I bought these thinking they would save me money instead of buying the disposable breast pads - they do not hold any leakage ! I was constantly leaking all over myself , and my baby boy !! I highly recommend the Lansinoh brand disposable pads instead . A friend recommended them to me , and they hold 6 ozs of liquid -LRB- my husband poured water on them as an experiment -RRB- . They are unstoppable ! As for these cloth ones - I 'm thinking of using them as shoulder pads : -RRB-
 I tried these also because I use cloth diapers , etc. and I have yet to find a washable pad that can actually hold enough for one nursing , even with doubling up . My absolute favorite pads are Curity brand , the price is good and they hold a huge amount of liquid . They also stay in place without a sticky backing , so until I find a good washable , I guess that 's what I 'll be using !
 Absorbed a little , but then milk leaks out from below the pad . Horrible , do not waste your time or money
 Not for heavy &#34; leakers &#34; . Get saturated in 2 min . I was surprised first couple times founding my bra completely wet , thought my baby peed on me during the feeding . Also leaking in front of other people and getting stained sweater is unexpected embarrassing surprise .
 These pads do n't stay in place . I will go to remove them to feed and find them way off center , sometimes barely behind my bra . They also are not very absorbent - when they do stay in place and I leak -LRB- at night -RRB- I still leak through my shirt . So really these pads do n't provide any protection . I do use the avent disposable pads and I like those a lot . Will go back to those until I find Washable ones I like .
 I would have one let down and the pad would be soaked through PLUS my clothing . And sometimes just a part of the pad would be wet but still leak all over my clothes ! I am not impressed but having washable is nice ... Avent 's disposable pads are AMAZING however . I 'll have several let downs and not a drop will get anywhere but on the nursing pad . So if your let downs only produce a drop or two , I 'd definitely get these washable ones ... but keep the lanolin close by cause if you do n't put some on you 'll stick to the pad and pulling it off after you 've had let down and it 's dried is pretty painful . But those disposable ones do n't have any problems like that . GET THE DISPOSABLE ONES !! : -RRB-
 These do n't absorb . I even got the impression that they are quite repellant to moisture . Spend more and get ones that are 100 % cotton . I do n't even use these ones after buying super thirsty unableached cotton ones from babies r us .
 I received these pads as a gift and they do not work . I am thrilled with all of the other Avent products but these pads are horrible ! I am considered a light flow and these pads DO NOT provide any type of absorbency ! I would not recommend the washable pads to anyone . The disposable ones will provide much better protection than these will .
 I purchased this item based on Avent being associated with high quality products . That is not the case with these pads . They are not very absorbant , especially for nighttime use , are too bulky to wear under anything but an extra large sweatshirt , and worst of all they stick to your nipples , increasing dryness , cracking and bleeding . It is a wonderful idea being able to reuse them , but not a workable one . I recently tried Johnson 's disposables that are extremely absorbant and the pad and leakage do not stick !
 I know we need something to keep our shirts and bra 's dry but there is a better way . . I cut not thin but not ultra maxi pads into 4 pieces . . DO N'T TAKE THE TAPE OFF until ready to use . . Then just peel off tape when needed and put em in your bra . . you are gon na stock up on pads anyway !
 I bought a 6pk . of Avent washable nursing pads because I have been going through a ton of disposables and it was getting expensive . Well , I put them on while I was still out and ended up with big wet circles on my shirt . When I took them out , they were completely DRY and my bra was soaked . I kid you not , they repel breast milk . Not to mention you could also see them through my shirt . Do not buy these .
 I purchased 2 packs of these pads with my first child 4 years ago . I really liked them and with my second , I needed one more pack due to a few being lost in the years in between . They still come in a great washable mesh bag , but the new pads are smaller and using very different materials than my first sets . I do not like this new style , OLD Version :4.5 '' diameterPoly lace exteriorJersey knit interior -LRB- only negative - it feels wet quickly -RRB- Overall very absorbentMolds to breast shape to create a concave pad interiorNEW Version : ~ 4 '' diameterPoly lace exteriorFlannel interior -LRB- positive - it does n't feel wet -RRB- Thin and not very absorbentStays in a flat shape and does n't mold to breast shapeThe only plus with this last set is the flannel interior . Overall I do not like the smaller size and do n't think these are nearly as absorbent as the older sets that I have . I will keep these as my emergency pads while my older sets will remain my everyday choice .
 I bought this as i needed relief from disposables and thought this would help . Its great quality and about the same size as the disposable Lanisoh ones , except the milk leaked right through my shirt after 5 mins of wearing it ! I recommend these for light leakers only !
 Ignored the bad reviews having loved all avent products so far . But these washable pads are the worst ! I thought i could use them for light leakage instead of the disposable ones but They dont even absorb light leakage !! The disposables are muchhh better .
 These pads would be great is they were n't so thick and if they were larger . They 're so bulky that you can see them through clothing very easily . Because they are so small and do n't stay in place well , they always seem to be just off to the side of the nipple whenever my milk lets down , so I end up leaking . I have a few pairs of nursing pads that seem to be just a couple layers of flannel and they work great . They 're thinner and cover more area . I would try to find flannel ones instead of these .
 If you leak a lot or have oversupply -LRB- before solids , especially if you 're pumping also -RRB- , these pads are n't good enough . I leaked right through them several times before I just decided to purchase some disposables with plastic backing . When my milk leaking slows down a little , I will start using them again .
 These almost seem to repel , rather than absorb liquid . I end up with milk all along the bottom of my bra and the pads feel totally dry . These are useless !
 I wish that I could give these pads less than 1 star ! I bought them because they seemed like such a good deal . A friend had given me the Dr. Brown 's washable nursing pads and I loved them and wanted to get more . The packages looked similar and you got two extra pads for less money than the Dr. Brown 's . The catch -- these pads were much too small ! I wear medium-support style nursing bras with stretchy spandex cups so it matters what the pads look like underneath my bra and clothing . These pads made me look too weird so I could not wear them in public . I took back the unopened packages -LRB- do n't know what to do with the opened one -- burn them ? -RRB- and spent the extra $ on a quality product . Just wanted to give a fair warning to you who are buying them on the internet . Happy nursing !
 I bought this product after reading some positive reviews . I used the pads once - and I leaked though the pads , my bra , and through my shirt . I tend to only leak a little at night and the disposable pads seam to work much better.The pads also were itchy - I do n't know if this will improve after I wash them . I am just too afraid to try again!I wanted to save money and the waste of pads , but a wet shirt just is n't worth it !
 For years I 've never written a review on here but these were such a waste I HAD to ! They serve their purpose for about an hour ! I am about a size D - DD and these were fine size wise but they do n't absorb much at all ! Do n't waste your money !
 These are n't absorbent at all . Better to go with disposible versions . I suspect it because the filling likely is n't a natural fiber or maybe it 's due to usuing fabric softener ...
 I was really really hoping I would like these - I have been using disposable pads , and it just seems like so much garbage to generate . When I first put these on , they were REALLY obvious under my clothes . The disposable pads get thin at the edges , but these are pretty thick at the edges and make an obvious circle under my shirt . But , I was wearing a few layers , so I figured I could deal with it . When I went to pump for the first time , I realized that my shirt was wet , but not where it normally would be . It turns out that the pads had blocked my milk from leaking out directly , but they had n't actually absorbed it , so the milk had just run down the pad and off the bottom edge . Instead of having a wet spot in the middle of my boob , I had a wet spot at the bottom of it . Different , but not better . I have used these a few times since then , but only if I am wearing a sweater over another shirt so that if I leak it does n't show anyways . On days when it actually matters , I use my disposable pads instead . I do n't end up wet every time I wear them , but that might be because I 'm not leaking anyways on those days .
 I really wanted to like this product . I wanted to avoid using disposable pads and purchased these pads based on the positive reviews of this product . I was totally disappointed . The pads are thick . They are so thick that they are so indiscrete when wearing them under shirts that are n't totally baggy . They 're not that absorbant either . I would wake up at night soaked and be fearful all day long that I was leaking through my shirt . After a few weeks , I gave up and switched to disposable pads and I am much happier .
 These pads are terrible . I used the Avent disposables which are the absolute best , so I thought their washables would be good as well . Well that was a big mistake . They curve outward instead of following the natural curve of the breast , making them visible under any type of shirt or sweater . I figured I could use them when I was home . Then I got tired of changing clothes from all the leaks I experienced . These pads do n't absorb much at all . What I was saving on disposables , I was wasting on detergent and time .
 These breast pads were next to the worst breast pads I tried . I would end up soaking wet after one let-down !! The disposable Avent breast pads were great , I just could n't use these . The absolute worst breast pads I used were the ones by evenflo . The gel/crystals would come out of the side of the pads and end up everywhere - including all over my son 's face . I do n't know if that stuff was non-toxic or not , but I just was n't comfortable with the possibility of my son ingesting all that absorbant gel ... The Evenflo pads were definitely the worst .
 after a little leakage , they stick.The type of pad with a lining is much better.the laundry bag is a nice feature .
 I like the look of these , the lace on the outer layer is cute , but they do n't hold moisture well at all . It 's about as absorbent as a flannel burp cloth - if you leak more than a tiny bit , it 'll go right through the pad . I used these at night occasionally because they 're soft and they would keep the milk from running down my shirt , but my shirt would be damp after every feeding . They 're also very thick , which makes them very noticeable under a shirt . If you want a great cloth nursing pad , get Bamboobies - they 're way more absorbent , thinner , less noticeable , and cuter . Do n't waste your money on these .
 These pads do n't do the job at all . They barely absorb any milk . I even washed them several times thinking that maybe it would soften up the fabric and increase their absorbency . Milk seems to run off the pad and into my nursing bra getting me wet and leaving the pad dry . I would be satisfied if there were any sign that the pad was actually soaking up any milk , but there 's not . Do n't waste your money .
 they are horrible ! they are bulky and do n't stay in place . they leaked right through my bra , shirts and my baby .
 I bought these because they are more environmentally friendly than disposables however they do not absorb much so I always end up changing my shirt because it leaks through . I do n't consider myself a heavy-let-downer at all -LRB- ie . the disposables never got saturated -RRB- so I was very disappointed . They are also very flat . A little contour would be nice , and make more sense because really , who 's breasts are totally flat ? The only thing I like about these is that they seem to wash well and come with a mesh bag , which is convenient .
 I guess these are for between feedings . While my son is nursing one side , the other side is completely soaked and it looks as if i have no pad at all . These really did not help me and are a waste of money and time . buy the disposable kind or even better , use sanitary napkins with leak guard . At least they have sticky backs to keep them in place .
 The good ... they 're inexpensive and washable . They even come with their own bag to wash them in.The bad ... These pads bunch up some when washed , are conspicuous when worn , move around in the bra and leak when worn overnight -LRB- I 'm not sure if the milk is running past them or going through them -RRB- . Also , if you put the pad back in your bra immediately after nursing without drying the nipple off or applying lanolin or something similar , the pad glues itself to the nipple which is very uncomfortable to peel off -LRB- you 'll need to wet the pad to get it off comfortably -RRB- .
 I bought several types of reusable nursing pads and these were , by far , the worst . They are not absorbent , not comfortable , move all over and just generally poorly made . The bag only held up for a couple washings . I 've started just throwing them away .
 I have three brands of washable breast pads and these are the worst by far . They do n't leak from the center but from around the edges of the pad . Every other pad has worked great for me but these . Also they are really thick , so they show under your shirt more than other brands . I would n't recommend them to anyone .
 I still leak with these . They are n't as absorbent as ones I bought on Etsy . Basically I only use them when I 'm desperate .
 Was n't impressed with the avent washable nursing pads for the following reasons : - material is non-absorbant - material is not as soft as other options available - pads stick to nipples - lace on the outside can be seen through bra/nursing tank - small circle creates a strange raised bump seen from outside
 I 'm normally not one to write reviews , but this product was AWFUL . It arrived today and I put them on immediately . Within one hour the front of my shirt was soaked beneath each breast . My baby is only 5 days old , so it 's not like I 'm producing large amounts of milk . The pads did not absorb anything . Even when I poured some milk on them to test them , the milk just ran off the pad . I will stick with the disposable by Lansinoh from now on -- they can hold milk for hours without leaking -- even overnight .
 These pads are too thick to use for any top that is n't baggy or a sweater . Additionally , they still manage to leak even as thick as they are ! The Gerber disposable pads with liners -LRB- they come in boxes of 60 -RRB- are much more effective . I hate adding to landfills , but I hate worrying about wet spots on my shirts for everyone to see even more !
 I have a Bravado nursing bra , and the Avent pads are too thick and too small in diameter . They do n't stay in place , they 're bulky and they do n't absorb as much as the Medela pads . I also do n't like that they stick to my nipples , and that they have lace on one side so you ca n't flip them over if they get a little damp and you 're not able to change them . Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money to get the Medela reusables . I should also mention -LRB- as I wish that someone had told me as a new mom -RRB- that you tend to leak a ton at first , so the Lansinoh disposables are the way to go , then you can switch to reusables after a few weeks when you do n't leak as much .
 These reusable nursing pads are n't worth getting at all . They do n't absorb quickly enough and they do n't hold anything hardly at all . My baby is 3 months old , and so it 's not like there is any type of engorgement -LRB- except morning -RRB- , and they ca n't keep up with normal nursing . Honestly your better off stuffing a burp cloth down your shirt than using one of these . I think I 'd rather use disposables , because at least they work .
 This is a total waste of money . It does not absolve any milk . I definitely would return it if I had not thrown the package away .
 I purchased these pads thinking I would save money over the disposable . How wrong was I. I was fully aware of the bulkiness -LRB- visable through clothing -RRB- prior to purchase , so that was n't the issue with me . I planned to wear them indoors only.These things do n't even stop a minimal leak . They do not contour properly around the breast & slide especially when lying down . They also soak through onto my clothing . Maybe my minimal leaks are as someone else 's moderate leaks . In either case , they do n't suit me.The disposable avent , though as bulky at least absorb . I should n't have to change pads 6 times a day.For outside use , the Lansinoh brand disposable pads are MUCH better . They have greater surface area & can withstand actual leaks.If anyone can recommend a re-usable pad that acts like the disposable Lansinoh brand , please post .
 very bad to usevery small nor cover the nipples at allnot comfortable it 's too late i already used it and i do n't theycan let me returned itdo n't buy it
 I was tired of using disposables so I wanted to try these ... I was so excited because they felt less ` plasticky ' than the disposables and claimed to have a boundary to prevent leakage . I did n't mind that they were n't very discrete under my nursing bra/cami and that they shifted around a little . What made them useless was that they let milk get through my bra and shirt after less than a couple hours of use . They did n't actually seem to leak through to the other side , they seem to collect milk and then let it sink down to the rim of the pad where it leaks at the edge of the pad . So much leaked through!I did read some reviews that said reusables are n't good for early nursers ... so I will try them again when my milk does n't really flow as much . Still keeping my review as only 1 star since they leaked when they 're not supposed to .
 I bought these thinking they would do the job & save me money from the disposable pads . These are the second disposable pads I 've bought & none of them seems to do the job , they leak thru instantly , your better off sticking to disposable pads ! : -LRB-
 It leaks through . I was nursing and milk came out of other breast onto shirt . They also fit funny inside bra . I have small breast and did not like these . I think it would be worse for someone with bigger breast since they leak
 After using about one-third of capsules -LRB- which are quite large -RRB- , this morning I noticed cloudiness inside the capsule I was about to take . It appeard to have some sorta `` gooey '' stuff floating around inside . Obviously , I threw the rest of them in the trash .
 I had been usingPure Alaska Omega-3 Wild Alaskan Salmon Oil 1000mg Softgels 180-Countand never ever had any after taste . I bought this product because of the lower price . After two days of taking this , I am ready to pitch them into the trash . They are causing me to burp with a terrible fishy after-taste . I would not re-order this if it were free . Too , these Softgels are much larger than the `` Pure Alaska '' product , even though both claim to be 1000 mg . If both do -LRB- you never know -RRB- contain the same amount , then the `` Pure Alaska '' is much easier to swallow .
 I opened the bottle and the capsules smelled very fishy . I read that if the pills smell fishy and you are burping up a fishy smell and taste , it is because the fish oil is old and has become ranchid which is unhealthy for you . Do not take these if you have this problem with yours .

 I purchased the Vapor-Eze Vaporizer/Aromatherapy Unit based upon the product reviews . I decided to write this review for the benefit of other people who are trying to make a good purchase decision . I generally love the smell of menthol or eucalyptus ... but this smell really bothers me . Also , the smell without the moisture really HURTS my sinuses - very painful . We live in the Pacific Northwest and have plenty of humidity in the air - so I 'm not sure what the problem is . For the past 40 yrs we have used various models of the Vicks Vaporizer - we add the water ; some Vicks ointment/liquid - it puts warm moisture into the air - it feels and smells great.A previous commenter noted they were disappointed the Vapor-Eze fragrance smell did not last longer . I think the smell lasts plenty long - too long . If you are planning to put this unit in an infants or childs room you might reconsider . If this hurts their sinuses - as it did mine - you wo n't know why they are crying.I 'm going to order the Vicks Warm Mist Humidifier instead .
 The zombie flavor is just gross . The chap stuck its selfs is smooth and nice but I could n't get over the smell of this flavor .
 It does n't taste or smell like Grand Marnier I was very disappointed . I would rather have my chapstick in cherry flavor . Atleast It has a taste .
 There is not a lot of good I can say about this product . It fell apart the second I took it out of the box . Was still somewhat usable , but not worth the cost .

 I purchased this for my 80 year old aunt who suffers from arthritis and osteoporosis . She said it did nothing for her , even when she used it with a heating pad . She would have a kitten if she knew what I paid for it . I think I 'll just order her the TENS unit and skip all the goop .
 I wear this type of splint to bed at night due to my carpal tunnel , my old splints bought at a medical supply store were getting pretty yucky after 3 years of use , so I figured I 'd replace them . Picture wise these looked identical to the ones I had . They are much lower quality.First , the metal splint is inserted into a slot that has no way of securing it at hte bottom , so it slips out . The velcro straps wrap around and adhere to the hook strip , but the strip is sewn all the way to the bottom edge and the hooks irritate my skin there as they poke through the edging . I applied medical tape over that section just to make the splint wearable . Lastly , the stretchy fabric inside the splint is rather tight , making the splint feel tight even if the straps are n't taught , however that part I 've gotten fairly used to.After using these about a month , I 'm going to have to go back to my old ones because they have worn a sore spot on my forearm from the hook and loop and I 'll probably go to a medical supply store to buy my next pair .

 I was hoping this product would make squinting at my computer unnessary , but the lines in the enlarger caused a weird distortion/glare . I ended up returing it after trying it our for less than 5 minutes , in various positions and distances from the screen . Returning was n't a huge problem but I had to pay postage and that was a bummer .

 On 11/24/2012 I compared the L-Protein amounts in my Whey protein supplements to the AMINO complete ingredient list . Big difference , the Whey has substantially more of everything I am interested in except L-Ornithine . I will be ordering L-Ornithine from NOW foods or another manufacturer . When I saw the other recent post indicating you would need 40 pills to do the job , I had a big laugh . That is exactly what I told my wife this morning . The higher dosages are what Dr. Oz is recommending for G.O.A.L. , 2000 mg combined .
 I was very disappointed in the Now Foods Amino Complete.First of all , I was under the impression that Amazon was required to disclose allergy information . These capsules contain powdered milk in the form of whey powder . People who are allergic to milk or are avoiding dairy should not buy this product . Also they are in gelatin capsules instead of the more common cellulose capsules.I used these 3 times a day for 2 weeks and did not feel any benefits . I even tried opening the capsules and mixing it with water and it does not dissolve . I imagine it does n't dissolve any better in your stomach.I ending up throwing away the rest of the bottle . This was a complete waste of money !
 Maybe I misunderstood what these do . It makes me eat ... a lot . Also , these caps are HUGE and the serving size is between 4-6 / day . That is a lot . I already take about 12 vitamins a day -LRB- necessity , due to gastric bypass -RRB- , I ca n't add any more.The main reason I did not like them is because when I take them , I eat a lot ; they make me hungry .
 I REALLY thought that I was going to choke to death the first time I tried them . It got stuck inmy throat and I could n't breath ... The pills are just too large ! I survived so i have never tried themagain !
 I received this product today and I will be returning this product today.The biggest red flag is you can not read the label online.I was looking for the Amino Acid Combination that Dr Oz spoke about on his show and this is not it . -LRB- Not even , close -RRB- The label states you have to take 4 pills to get only 600 mg of the combined vitamin . Some to the vitamin contents are as low as 24 mg.Unless you are taking meds to stay alive , NO ONE should be taking almost 40 pills a day.I am looking for the G.O.A.L 2000 mg that Dr OZ speaks of on his show.Any Suggestions?Glycine &#8211; Ornithine-Arginine - Lysine
 I used to take amino acids because i was doing MMA and for energy I used it . Untill my doctor and trainer told me that amino acids cause cancer

 It feels good to stretch the plantar muscle ... this did n't help me feel better . the night splint finally helped
 I hate these types of deodorants/anti-antiperspirants . Leaves a white residue on clothes and is also very sticky on your skin . Makes me want to run back home , throw my clothes in the washer and take a shower to get this sticky thing off my armpits .

 After reading the reviews I thought this tea will work for me but I was wrong . It did not work for me , I did n't experience any stomach cramps or help control my appetites . I drank 2 cups per day but it still wo n't work . I think it depend on individual 's body . It may not work for me but it may work for you . The taste is not bad so just try it and see if it will work for you .
 tasted like raid and did nothing . giant bags if u want lots of blech tea also , i think my amazon id was hacked after visiting this site . just say no !
 Crest Pro-Health is a mouthrinse that has no alcohol -LRB- less burning , less drying of mouth -RRB- , which is rare in a mouthwash , as most mouthwashes are at least 50 % or more alcohol -LRB- alcohol is a good disinfectant -RRB- . To replace the antibacterial effect of the alcohol , Crest has added the agent CPC -LRB- cetylpyridinium chloride -RRB- . This is a positively charged molecule that is drawn to the negatively charged bacteria in one 's mouth . CPC causes death of the bacteria through destroying the cell 's membrane . Thus , it does indeed kill bacteria and bacteria is what causes bad breath , gingivitis , and cavities.The addition of CPC does not come without drawbacks however . There are two main side effects that may cause consumers to avoid this product . First and foremost , when CPC kills bacteria , and the bacteria are not removed from the teeth , they eventually stain brown . Thus , if the consumer is not extremely diligent in removing plaque by brushing thoroughly and flossing at least once per day , there is the almost certain result of brown staining . The stain will appear between the teeth , as this is where bacteria primarily reside . The stain is not permanent , and can be removed , but it can be unsightly . -LRB- Be aware that the presence of brown stain means the product is working -RRB- . To avoid staining , one must thoroughly brush one 's teeth and floss BEFORE rinsing for one minute with Crest Pro-Health . Since the recommendation is to rinse twice a day -LRB- as CPC lasts 12 hours -RRB- , the thorough cleaning must be done each time . Be aware that Staining is furthered by the drinking of coffee and dark colas.The second side-effect is a possible taste alteration associated with CPC . Food may have a slightly metalic taste . This is not reported by all users.From a dentist 's perspective , this is a good product , but it is not for everyone . Since most people do not thoroughly brush and floss their teeth twice a day , most people will experience the brown staining and cease to use this product -LRB- thus all the negative product reviews -RRB- . If you are willing to do the work of a thorough cleaning twice a day , then this product will further improve your oral health by killing bacteria.The final drawback -LRB- not usually mentioned -RRB- is the price . This bottle holds 500 ml of rinse . If one uses 10 ml per use and uses 20 ml per day , this product will not last a month . So one may go through two bottles a month.This product requires much of the user in terms of oral hygiene and pocket-book cost . It is a good , safe , and effective product , however , one must carefully consider if the required motivation is present before purchasing the rinse . It is not for everyone.This manufacturer is charging over $ 5.00 for a product that goes for less through other suppliers . If you want to try this product , choose a different manufacturer . I give this manufactuer one-star . The product itself , in terms of effectiveness is rated 3-stars . Dr. Jim Koenig , DDS
 I got the lighter about 2 month ago it 's already not working cause it 's fake Dupont . I do n't know what to do with this does any one know what can I do for this ? I 'm so regretted
 The posture corrector actually does a lot for your posture , but it is so uncomfortable that I really do n't wear it . If you are willing to wear it over clothes , it may work , but it can really irritate the skin when worn direclty over it .
 I got hydroxycut , and yes -- it did curb my appetite ... but it 's not worth it for these results : FDA received reports of serious health problems ranging from jaundice and elevated liver enzymes , an indicator of potential liver injury , to liver damage requiring liver transplant . One death due to liver failure has been reported to the FDA . Other health problems reported include seizures ; cardiovascular disorders ; and rhabdomyolysis , a type of muscle damage that can lead to other serious health problems such as kidney failure .
 This mirror is virtually useless . It does n't produce enough light to shave by , apply make up with or see yourself properly . What a waste of money .
 The People at BP Medical fail to mention that % MOST % of their products are either overstocks or factory rejects from Ever Dixie EMS Supply . Their bags fall apart , have bad seams , etc. . Then , when mentioned the bags are falling apart , they promise a replacement and you never hear from them again .
 Guess I should have read the fine print rather than go off the pic . It was the bag only and I was expecting a kit . Nice bag but now I have to fill it too .
 Nice bag , but the picture makes it seem like supplies come with - they do not . Also it is very hard to get blood stains off this bag , which seems a little silly .

 I had read in other reviews about the odor of this product , but did not think that would bother me , so I ordered it anyway . Should have headed their warning ! If you have any issues with unpleasant odors , do not get this . I will stick with the Thermalon products instead .
 does n't matter how long you leave this in the freezer , it does n't even get cool . have not tried to heat because I bought it as a cold pack . for me , a big waste of money .
 I am not sure what the point in this item is . I bought in hopes of using it for cold sinus relief but it does no such thing . Maybe only works if you heat it up . It does not work cold at all . You can leave it in the refridgerator or freezer and it does n't get cold . When you place it on your head it is room temperature and does nothing for sinus relief . HUGE waste of money .
 This looked like a good idea , so I bought two of them -LRB- one for each bathroom -RRB- . Neither one of them works , 10 months later . One of them had stopped working within 3 months of purchase ! I will not be buying more of these .
 These used to be the best ever . Sometimes I could use a strip for several days . Then they changed , although the company denies they changed anything.Strips are made of a gauze like material covered with a coating that when moistened by your saliva adheres to your dental plate and molds to your gums . The last couple of years the gauze material seems thinner and the coating is thicker . This results in there being too much gooey stuff on a thinner gauze strip and the strip slides off your dental plate after a few hours . The result is it becomes a gooey mess.I called the company and they deny any change but that 's not so ! Recently I ran across a package I had in an old bag and they are the old ones and they are the best ever ! But when they 're gone I guess that 's it - back to the slipy slidy stuff.I compared the old strips to the new ones and that 's how I figured out just what changed . Too much gooey and not enough gauze in the strips . What a pity that they managed to mess them up because they used to be the BEST !
 They melt in my mouth . I would like to return them for a full refund . they were hard too get out of my mouth .
 It 's not possible to rate a product that never arrives.No delivery , no response to contact.Perhaps they 've been taken up in the Rapture .
 The 120 softgel version is almost 50 % more expensive than the tablet version . I thought I was getting a good deal by ordering the tablet version , having bought the softgel version previously . But the nutrition label of the tablet bottle , even though yielding the same 2mg Astaxanthin as the softgel bottle , shows a very different amount of the raw materials -LRB- Haematococcus pluvialis algae extract -RRB- used to make the 2mg Astanxanthin , than the softgel bottle label . I asked Source Naturals about this big difference via email but they never replied . In addition , the softgel version indicates `` AstaREAL '' but the tablet version does not . So one has to be careful to examine the differences between a softgel and tablet version of the same supplement supplied by the same supplier .
 This product is NOT VEGAN . LEGALLY , something can not be labeled as vegan if it has BEESWAX in it . I am using it because I bought it and I opened it without noticing the label so some bees suffered somewhere for it for no reason if I throw it out , but I am really **** ing pissed that this was labeled vegan and it is not .
 I put this salve on my tattoo and it burned so badly I broke into tears . I contacted the manufacturer , and they said it was probably mislabeled . I believe it should come in a black tube , but mine was white . I hope this was an isolated incident .
 Terrible taste . Order stated 45 count bottles came with only 30 . Adults ca n't even stomach the taste or texture of this product let alone children .
 I love this product but it is very cheaply made , quit in the middleof my love session . Suction is wonderful if made better
 This thing is horrible ! It 's hard to turn off and on and the removable vibrator part actually sits on and rubs `` you know what '' , lol . Not pleasant at all . Not even worth $ 5 !
 No doubt about it , this unit has powerful suction . But even so , it does n't pick up any of the cat hair on my upholstered couch , no matter how many times I go over the fabric . Disappointing .
 Suction is great . However , it front plastic cover comes off all the time and dirt can come out when the vacuum is off . So you need to empty all the time . This vacuum is very cheaply made . It is also very loud .
 I can not begin to explain what a complete and total rip off this product is . The pieces wo n't stay together , the suction is subpar , it falls apart if you look at it . Having experienced Black and Decker `` quality '' before , I should have known that this would be their standard substandard , but other reviews convinced me that maybe B&D ; had turned around.They have n't . It 's un-usable if you want to use the rotating head . I 'm sure if you 're just using the handheld part , and do n't want the rotor brush , that it picks up crumbs just fine , but as a pet hair vac , it 's pointless . It 's heavy enough that I bruised the bejebus out of my foot when it fell apart and fell on my foot.It 's loud , it 's low quality , and a better use of your $ 30 would be to set it on fire to see the pretty colors . After multiple attempts to fix their design flaws , including duct taping the pieces together , I 've just put it in the charity box.Avoid this waste of cash . Seriously .
 I regret buying this vacuum . The pet hair attachment was clunky to use , very difficult to move across the surface of our couches in the first place , and then it got clogged with pet hair almost immediately and stopped working -LRB- the attachment stopped spinning , vacuum still works -RRB- . I went in and unclogged it once only to have it stop working again a few minutes into cleaning . I do n't know what I am going to use this for now as it 's not a very convenient handheld vacuum with no rechargeable battery power option so it must be plugged in , which makes it difficult to use to spot clean around the house .
 I purchased this product specifically for my new vehicle which I use to tote my dogs around . They shed all over the carpet lining in the back and I was hoping I would get results from this machine as it had an attachment designed for the sole purpose of picking up dog hair . The motor was powerful , I will admit that , but I did n't actually see it do anything with all that power ! The suction was very poor and was even less effective when using the hose . I felt like I was getting somewhere with the pet hair attachment for a while but it did n't take very long for the spinning plastic bristles to stop working . So after using it for about 15 minutes , and with very little in the chamber -LRB- as it hardly picked up anything except some pebbles ! -RRB- , I thought I would see it the filter needed to be cleaned and it did n't . I also tried to clean out the dog hair attachment to little avail . It still does n't work.I did not have high expectations in the first place and this product still did n't meet me even half way at that ! If you plan on suctioning up cheerio 's or rice - by all means get this $ 40 item . Heck I 'll give you mine . I went back to using duct tape and have n't looked back .
 I just bought this item at Walmart . My intent was to use it for quick daily pickups in between the weekly thorough vacuuming - pulling out my big machine is a drag.I chose it because there are no air vents on the sides as some other hand vacuums which cause dipersion of debris . I have 2 cats which shed their hair on my sofa and armchair . The Retriever was promising as it sounds very powerful , but it did not collect that much hair . You had to `` insist '' and still it would leave hair behind . A favorite spot of my cats is on the top of the back of the sofa which is 3 inch wide , it was next to impossible to collect the mat of hair there . An annoying feature was the `` neck '' of the pet brush which connects to the machine . It is very flexible and if you try to apply pressure , the brush just raises and just skims the sofa lightly . Very fast , 5-10 minutes into the job , the machine starts feeling very hot . I am returning the Retriever tomorrow . It is not saving me time at all .
 I have dog at home and purchase that product just for dogs hair . The turbo brush is just OK . It is not working great . If you push it to hard it stops . So If you need that for hard hair cleaning I would not recommended that . Good luck
 The machine does n't hold up well with usage . I 've had it for a few months and now it overheats after five minutes and turns itself off - even when the canister has been cleaned out . The attachments worked great the first two months and then one by one stopped working . The vacuum power is so weak with the attachments on that I can barely feel it with my hand.Without the attachments , the vacuum is still pretty powerful , but again it overheats after five minutes . I ca n't even clean small surfaces without waiting for the machine to cool off and turn itself back on.My cat 's hair is pretty rough and tends to get itself entwined in fabrics making it really hard to clean up . The spinning carpet attachment did a pretty decent job getting the cat hair off my couch - until it stopped working .
 This vacuum overheats after five minutes and turns itself off . It picks up pretty much nothing . Loud and heavy useless junk .
 doesnt capture that much hair at all.trust me - it is horrible .
 Originally it was poorly described in the listing . Not what I wanted.It was not what I wanted.It was for pets and I have no pets .
 wish I had not bought this . The actual vacuum is fine , very strong , but the attachment is very poorly designed . The brush spins by suction and is easily stopped . the whole brush assembly completely fell apart the first time I dropped it , which is easy to do because of the awkward two-hand approach needed to use it .
 It does n't do a good job sucking up the cat litter from the carpet or the cat hair . If I 'm patient with it , and keep trying , the motor gets too hot and shuts down . Very very disappointing item.It 's easy to change attachments/empty the receptacle and the filter works well .
 This vacuum comes with no attachments except the brush for pet hair , which is useless for getting into corners and crevices , and I ca n't seem to find any additional attachments I can get for it . If you just want to clean up dust and pet hair in open discreet areas , it works OK , but for anything more , look elsewhere . Mine 's going back to Amazon .
 We purchased this hand-held to pick up dog fur and also to get dust off of our dogs fur . The suction is definitely not up to par . I 'd compare the suction to one of those inexpensive , unknown name brand vac 's you buy at K-mart or some other retailer for 19.95 or less . For a small hand held it is extremely loud and does heat up quickly . This machine is overpriced and I expected much better from Black & Decker . I would definitely shop around for a higher quality hand-held and only buy this unit if it is a last resort . It failed miserably when used to suck up dog fur from a futon mattress , a leather recliner chair . By the way , this unit absolutely will not pick up dust from a computer/keyboard , nor should it be used as such -LRB- i.e. as a data vac -RRB- .
 I have a balinese cat that sheds 2 '' -3 '' hairs -- not huge clumps , but a uniform `` dusting '' everywhere.The pet hair attachment here is ALMOST a really good design -- pops open easily for regular cleaning . Unfortunately , it 's driven by a fan unit -LRB- i.e. by the cleaner 's suction power -RRB- which is not user-serviceable . After ten square feet of slightly-furred close-nap area rug , its axle was gunked up and it did n't spin freely.This hobbled design is simply not up to the task for which it 's sold .
 I loved this little vacuum , but had to replace the brush head twice , and it still did n't last . Very disappointed .
 I bought this to clean up dog hair on furniture . -LRB- My dog is an Aussie/Golden mix with lots of long hair . -RRB- I used it on my couch , but I had to go back over it with the hand tools on my bulky upright to get rid of all the dog hair . Maybe it works better for short-haired pets . As for general use -LRB- other than dog hair -RRB- , my cordless dustbuster works just as well as this one , without the hassle of a cord .
 I purchased this unit based on reviews and that it is corded -LRB- more power -RRB- . Well I pluged it in and it worked for about 1 minutes worth of vacuuming up ash from my pellet stove . It quickly over heated and shut down . I returned it and am now looking for a different , good hand held vacuum .
 It has a powerful motor with high suction . Unfortunately the position of such a motor in a light , handheld device creates a tremendous gyroscopic effect . The thing always wants to move in a different direction than you want it to . It 's like the thing is alive and fighting you . Extraordinarily irritating and inconvenient . Definitely NOT recommended . I am sending mine back .
 I purchased this corded handheld vacumn because another brand unit my wife had had for many years finally wore out . This unit has proved to be a disapointment because of the egeronomics of it . this actual brush/cleaning head is so far from the handle that it puts a large amount of stress on your wrist and tires you out quickly . Also the dirt collection chamger is awkward to open and close and too small so it needs to be emptied often . It does clean but with so many problem I can not recommend it to others .
 black and decker hand vac we got for picking updog hair is not worth 29.99 . Maybe 15.99 at themost.The attchments donot work at all ! But theone thing I give it credit for is the suction!Thats great !
 My mom bought this vac for me for my Bridal shower.She picked it up in Target with my sister after having a laugh when they saw the vac was called `` the retriever `` My husband and I have a 90 lb blond Golden who sheds like crazy . After one or two rounds vaccuming my couch and stairs the retreiver attachment became entangled with his fur . I had to break apart the attachment I could not get the bristles clean . I HATE that vac . Now I use my swiffer vac on my hard wood . A lint roller on my couch , and TV 's One Sweep -LRB- sweepa -RRB- to rake the dog hair out of my area rug . UGH ! Thanks `` Retriever '' you stink

I got my money back and I 'm pleased Amazon took care of things but I 'm posting this review as a warning to others .
 SLOW DELIVERY
 Length :
 I never received the test strips . I was informed 3 weeks later , that they were out of stock
 The zombie flavor is just gross . The chap stuck its selfs is smooth and nice but I could n't get over the smell of this flavor .
 It does n't taste or smell like Grand Marnier I was very disappointed . I would rather have my chapstick in cherry flavor . Atleast It has a taste .

 Avoid products containing Paraben -LRB- methy , ethyl ... -RRB- if you are attempting to balance your hormones . This product has two of these known endocrine disrupting chemicals that mimic estrogen in the body . The is the exact opposite action you are seeking if you are attempting to balance your estrogen dominence .

 Pros
 I have been using this cleanser for 2 years . So I know the product . The 2 bottles I purchased are fakes . Total Fraud . Will definitely reconsider purchasing from amazon .
 I bought this item with active tone and active moist , this three products are very generic and applicable to normal face types . I never had any acne problem , I never had any skin problem before , I was using Babe until now and my skin was perfect even when I was at 17s I never had any acne problem . But since I started using this product my skin became awful , it is unbelievable , I paid a lot of money and I can not use it , if I attempt to use it , in 1-2 days I start having at least 4-5 strange acnes all over my face . I strongly not recommend anyone to buy it .
 The first time I bought Dermalogica from Amazon the product was not a `` knock off '' . I believe -LRB- for sure -RRB- this time the microfoliant and cleansing gel are acounterfeit product . I would not purchase this again from Amazon .
 Omni solutions sent us '' Essesntial Cleansing Solution '' instead of '' Special Cleansing gel '' and then they sent the replacement via regular First Class mail and it reached us after like 3 weeks because of postal delays . I would have thought they would send it through a faster service sinc eit was their fault . I would avoid them in the future .
 I have tried -LRB- what seems like -RRB- every natural deodorant product out there . I 've tried all the natural brands , sprays , crystals ... you name it I 've probably tried it . I REALLY wanted them to work because I hate putting the Aluminum-based products on my skin . BUT , none of them work . They may work for a few weeks , but it seems like my body builds a tolerance to them and then their effectiveness goes away . I was hoping this would be a better alternative to the Aluminum based deodorants I have been forced to use . Using Deodorant that is n't effective not only makes ME stink , but it also ruins all of my clothes and they 're left with that stench that DOES NOT GO AWAY ... yuck ! I 've been using this product for two days now and already it is not working and I 've got that smell on my shirts . :--LRB- The sweating does n't seem to be an issue as much as the stink is . Unfortunate I 'm going to have to resort back to the bad stuff ... I just ca n't afford to continue ruining my wardrobe .
 I wanted a deoderant without any harsh chemicals ... so i opted to go with this . The only problem is it does NOT WORK at all .
 This is by far the worst deodorant I 've ever used . It does n't stop BO and only adds the smell of cheap Mexican laundry detergent to the mix . Yuck ! It 's so bad I stopped using it before I even found a replacement . I ordered it because the UNSCENTED variety of this brand I used for years and loved is apparently no longer available . I figured the Aloe scented one could n't be too bad . WRONG ! Too late now for a refund so the two I bought are headed for Goodwill or a landfill ... : -LRB-
 yes of course this works very well and i like that its gel but it says its all natural and stuff ... the like 3rd of something ingredient has sum icky ingredient ... i wouldnt buy it again !
 I purchased this deodorant for my husband who has developed chemical sensitivities to a number of products due to mercury/heavy metal toxicity caused by the `` silver '' aka mercury fillings in his teeth . The packaging and label fooled me into believing it was a good , natural product . When my husband developed a bad reaction to the deodorant , I inspected the label and the list of ingredients . The very first ingredient is Propylene Glycol - do some research on this chemical - it is reported to have severe adverse health effects including contact dermatitis and allergies , kidney and liver damage . I did n't need to research any of the other ingredients as this first one was enough for me to toss the remaining deodorant in the trash . I 'm completely and totally offended that this company would put itself out there as producing a healthy , safe product when in fact it contains harmful chemicals . Yes , it has no aluminum , paraben or alcohol , but it does contain toxic substances . Buyer beware !
 As we all know , or should know , aluminum is a very real suspected culprit in Alzeimer 's Disease and Anti-perspirants are loaded with it . I purchased this aluminum-free deodorant and it just does n't do the job . I could smell the stuff on myself , so I surmised others could too . Also , it does n't work , failed after a few hours . Do n't waste your money on this . I loved my Secret Anti-perspirant , but alas , it has aluminum in it . I am going to try Arm & Hammer Essential next , which I ordered off the internet and can not find in the stores -LRB- aluminum free -RRB- and hope to god it works . Hopefully I will find the right deodorant -LRB- ca n't use anti-perspirants as they ALL have aluminum in them -RRB- that will work , and this ai n't it folks . By the way , those that think I do n't know what I 'm talking about . ME 's have found excess aluminium in the brains of dead cadavers who died from Alzheimers -LRB- I always wondered what the common denominator was -RRB- and I , for one , would rather not risk it , therefore , I do n't cook with aluminum pans and will not use any anti-perspirants or deodorant with aluminum in them .
 This stuff is supposed to be `` natural '' . It has such a strong chemical fragrance that it caused my wife to get a migraine within 2 hours of first applying it . We had a one time use stick of deodorant that went into the trash can . If you are sensitive to chemical fragrances , or are trying to be chemical free - DO NOT BUY THIS .
 I put a ton of this on at about 8 pm right after a shower . It smelled nice and did n't irritate my pits , which is good . However , by 10 am the next morning I had a nice funk going on and I 'm not a particularly smelly person , nor did I do anything strenuous that night , if you know what I mean . I can see detecting a slight , `` Oh I better reapply '' kinda smell the next morning but it was full on `` I need to shower '' b.o. I went ahead and reapplied because I was n't quite ready for a shower and an hour or two later I was smelling again . Needless to say , did n't work for me . I 'm 28 , maybe I 'm still too hormonal , who knows .

 I 've got a room mate that swears by these . I bought a few packs of these , and did n't notice a single difference in my memory/mental capacity , the way my room mate raves . I think it 's more of a placebo for him .

She told me that she felt almost nothing from these , It also did something to her . I too felt a difference , and it was not for the better . And did I last longer ... NO . Look for something else to try . Durex should not be making these .

 I bought the Merkur after reading lots of great reviews , and because I have a nostalgia for old fashioned things . I used it for about a month , and then for comparison I switched back to my Sensor Excel . No comparison . For closeness and ease of shaving the sensor was just much , much better . I was really disappointed because I was rooting for the Merkur . In reality I should n't have been surprised . How would newer models ever have sold successfully if they were not , in some way , improved ? Maybe it 's because I have a really tough beard ; I ca n't say for sure . The one place where the Merkur came out ahead was that I noticed I never got any nicks or cuts while using it . But again , I did n't get a close shave either . So , the only thing I can say for sure is that it must be great for some guys -LRB- based on the reviews -RRB- , but it is n't for every beard . For what it 's worth , I hope this helps other guys who might be taking a look at the Merkur or other classic safety razors . Happy shaving .
 I purchased this product through amazon a few weeks ago . It 's truly a piece of trash . the shave is extremely irritating and it 's not closer than a mach 3 or fusion shave . It does n't adjust to your face ; so shaving takes forever , not because you 're getting a good shave , but simply because it 's too irritating and possibly dangerous . If you want a good , cheap shave . buy Target Brand razors . they are cheap and give you a great shave . thanks

 I would n't recommend these -LRB- or any other 9V rechargeable -RRB- for smoke detector applications . They drain down after 120 to 180 days and need a charge ... which is ok , if you are disciplined enough to make this necessary recharge . They will save you money over time compared to the alky bats , so you make the call . Chargers for these bats are also pricy and you need to make sure you have a charger that will handle your battery . An 9.5 charger will fry an 8.5 bat ... beware .
 The package arrived . When I opened the package it contained nothing but dried out paper cloths . I found it not useable and certainly felt ripped off .
 It does not do what it claims to do , therefore I give it one star . I wish I could give it zero stars , though . The cloths actually scratch CDs and DVDs . They also leave lint residue on the CDs . As one other reviewer mentioned , the cloths really do look like fabric softener sheets that you put in the dryer . Do n't waste your money on these `` cleaning '' cloths .
 The only thing these `` cloths '' might be good for is invisible dust that could just as easily be blown off ... certainly not smudges , because they are dry and slightly abrasive and if you apply any pressure at all they will scratch your CD . Forget about any kind of `` cleaning '' with them ! Also , the name is misleading . They are not `` cloths '' , the texture is actually similar to a Bounce dryer sheet -- and who would try to clean a CD with one of those ?
 I do karaoke and have over 500 cd-s . I use a special machine to clean them , polish out the scratches and apply an anti-statis spray to them . With these cloths they seem to small and take to long to wipe down my cd 's . I 'm using some flannel PJ 's right now which seem to work great , quickly and no lint or scratches . Hopefully I can find some decent cloths because I clean so many CD 's . The machine I use for cleaning the CD-s is professional grade and run 's about $ 199 , I can use 1200 grit sandpaper for very deep scratches , but normaly I use two different cleaning compounds and then the spray so there is a lot to clean after I run my CD-s through this machine .
 I received the product quickly , however , I was very disappointed with the actual product . Each sheet is much smaller than I expected . I need 2-3 sheets to clean one disc . I would not buy product again .
 I have no clue how to properly describe this , other than to say it is odd at best . You can not possibly compare this to a rabbit or some of the other adult sex toys . I would not recommend this .

 This is a total waste . All the crap you dont need , very little of what you do . Its shown with many meds but its really mostly stuff you wont need . I will be returning it promptly and suggest you dont make the same mistake I did .
 So far there is little scientific evidence that saw palmetto actually helps with male prostate problems . In my experience it was totally ineffective in preventing either BPH or prostate cancer . Check with a urologist -- most are skeptical , too . Basically saw palmetto has the same effect as a low-grade , weak estrogen dose .
 I normally buy a different B12 that 's more expensive and has a wonderful sweet flavor , without any added ingredients . It 's just pure B12 . However , I tried this product because I thought the price was great and if I bought in bulk I could save money . Ugh . . bad idea . It tastes like cough syrup !!! I ca n't even swallow it . Terrible flavor , I 'm sorry .
 My husband and I used this a couple times , and we did n't notice any kind of difference in our mood or energy level . I later found out that is because this contains the synthetic version of B12 , and my body is unable to use it due to my MTHFR gene mutations .
 The taste is horrible . And even after you try to wash it down with juice or water , the taste lingers . I will stick to pills .
 I have not purchased this item but it has cyanacobalamin in it . This is not the correct form of B12 . Cyanacobalamin is made from cyanide and it is not the form that is helpful for the myelin sheath of the brain . If you are going to buy B12 , you need the METHYLcobalmin form ONLY !
 This product was terrible - I have had night sweats and panic attacks for about 2 weeks now . After marking off the other supplements I take on a daily basis , this one was still causing me problems . I stopped taking it today , and feel incredibly more relaxed , and not anxious at all . I was getting worried I had major issues , but have now figured out that this product is worthless . Get you B12 someplace else ... 5000mcg per dosage is WAY to much , and I 've read online today that my symptons are textbook B12 overdose . I would never in 1 million years buy this piece of junk again ... at least I will sleep good tonight : D
 The taste is very strong ! Does n't make we want to throw up but makes me not want to use them often ! This is my first tine using this type of drop so maybe they all taste bad ??????
 I 'm worried about this product containing `` brown rice syrup '' . The problem is that rice used to make brown rice syrup is typically grown in regions where arsenic pesticides were heavily used before the EPA banned them in 2009 . And while these pesticides are no longer used , their toxic residue is still lurking in the soil where our food is grown . I 'd like to know how much arsenic is in this product or would rather it not have brown rice syrup in the product at all . If the amounts are low or none , I 'd love to make this a more positive review .
 This stuff is just plain gross . I ca n't even get past the smell of it , or the bright red -LRB- obviously artificial -RRB- color of it . And , you have to take a full TEASPOON of it ! I tried to keep it in my mouth for 30 seconds , and made it about 5 before gagging and spitting it out ! The container leaks while standing up too , so if you do n't want anything stained bright red , put it into a bag or something . Being on Atkins , I needed a `` pick me up '' vitamin , and this is not it . Has 2 carbs per teaspoon , which likely means SUGAR ... which is not listed in the ingredients . I threw this in the trash after one try . Do n't waste your money . YUCK YUCK YUCK !!!
 This gave me a headache , unfortunately . I figure it may be the xylitol , but I 'm not sure . In any case , I ended up unable to use it . Douglas Laboratories makes a B12 liquid without any artificial sweeteners , so I 'm using that now without any problem .

 I have no idea if the pill itself is good or not but I took it for about 30 days twice a day . The pill is so big I almost choked to death twice . The second time I hacked and heaved for 10 minutes because it went down the wrong hole and finally it came flying back out . I took the rest of the bottle and threw it away . Not worth choking to death on horse pills .
 I used the product and found it helped with joint pain as does the other Glucosamine/Chondroitin/MSM products on the market however I am prone to GERD . I couldnt understand why I was getting GERD flare-ups but eventually I suspected the Osteo-Bi Flex with the Boswellia serrata extract was the cause so upon looking into it I found that a common side effect -LRB- s -RRB- is : One of the most common side effects of Boswellia serrata extract , when it 's used at recommended doses , is mild gastrointestinal upset . Discomfort may include nausea , heartburn , stomach pain , a feeling of fullness or diarrhea.The day after I stopped taking the Osteo-Bi Flex with the 5-Loxin -LRB- Boswellia serrata extract -RRB- the esophageal burning disappeared completely .
 I have made a return to the gym and picked up body building again after a 10 year absence . I took my time and after 2 years back into it , my strength has come back but I have had serious shoulder joint pain . My chiropractor suggested this product and I have been taking 2 - 3 tablets a day along with 3,000 mg of fish oil and the pain is still there . The best relief I can get is from over the counter `` naproxen sodium '' which is dirt cheap . I 'm not saying this product wo n't do miracles ; it just did n't do any for me .
 Wife saw no improvement in her knees after 3 weeks . Large uncoated pills hard to swallow . Very disappointedWill not purchase again
 Bought this for a family member because of the product description -- which is wrong when it says `` Ships complete , with easy to assemble snap on seat with lid and large 12 qt . capacity pail with lid '' . It ships completely broken down and must be fully assembled . The snap on seat is easy to assemble but it does not otherwise come complete . Also , the cross bars that hold in the bucket are too short and do n't fit . I am going to bend them out to make them longer and then I think they will fit . Very disappointed . Otherwise , the product appears durable and good for the cost . I would probably give it 4 or 5 stars but for the bad description and the too short bars .

 The posture corrector actually does a lot for your posture , but it is so uncomfortable that I really do n't wear it . If you are willing to wear it over clothes , it may work , but it can really irritate the skin when worn direclty over it .

 If you are seeking a good quality then do not expect that this will be the product to buy . For the cost you pay , it may be OK , but personally I prefer to pay some extra and get a better product like Dura-Stick II Electrotherapy Electrodes , it cost almost double , but defiantly it is much betterBeware that the adhesive conducting layer is not good at all and that will limit the number of times you use it.Also , the shipping price is so expensive - but it is also expensive on the other product I am suggesting to use .
 They work well the first time , maybe the second - but after that the gel quickly disappears and they fall off the skin quite easily . With medical needs coming first , you are best off to get high quality pads that can be used over a couple weeks . The brand -LRB- I forget the name this moment -RRB- that my physical therapist uses kept working even after two weeks . I do n't know if the ones reliamed ships are just old , or just not very high quality but you will waste more money by going through the pads quickly rather than purchasing higher quality pads at a higher price . Buyer beware .
 I do n't write a negative review lightly , nor often . However when a product claims `` 40 '' uses , then notes it depends on so many variables , I would expect to get at least 4-5 uses our of a package of electrodes . I get 2-3 usesper set of 4 . I have tried taking showers prior to usage allowing my body to completely dry . I have used Alcohol wipe prep pads to remove any oils from my skinjust prior to use assuring the skin is dry and clean . Yet , after the first use the edges start to lift up . The 3rd use a pad or two will not stick securely enough . When the pad does not adhere to the skin surface well you end up with the current arching slightly on the skin and this concentrates the charge in a small pinpoint location causing burningand discomfort.I even tried using the unit on my wife with a similar set of processes to ensure it was just not my body over producing skin oils or some other personal issue . Usage on my wife achieved similar results.A previous reviewer reviewed the dual channel -LRB- twin Stem TENS unit -RRB- and noted to `` toss the included electrodes they are junk '' and purchase an alternate suppliers electrodes for the unit . A package of 4 of these electrodes are included with the unit . Excellent advice , however since I ca n't find that review , I just asked my Physical Therapist which they used and ordered several pair . Much better . So my recommendation is ask your PT which ones they use and order them instead . They are `` The cheapest pads around '' for a reason . Avoid unless you can afford to toss them out after one use .
 You have to replace them quite often , because of the adhesive . In the other hand , good conductivity .

 As another review said , it is too good to be true.I got one and everything they said is true . The batteries are hard to remove . It does n't turn off and the cap needs to be unscrewed to turn it off . The 7-speed functions do n't work , it 's either on or off.I thought it might just have a glitch and tried to work on it , but it is such a piece of junk there is no fixing it.I definitely recommend you spend a couple more dollars and get something better .
 Look at the ` too good to be true ' price and then take my learn-ed advice
 Junk ! Do n't wast your money ... Drains the batteries in a few minutes . There are lots better products out there for your buck ...
 This is a very powerful vibrator but the small battery does not last and is expensive to replace .
 The item does n't turn off unless you remove batteries . Plus the unit get extremely hot . This item is not safe and not worth the one cent they are now charging for it .
 I got this bullet with myTantus Omega Vibrator , Pink Pearl . Otherwise I would n't own it . It came with 3 cell batteries , which can be expensive . They are also very hard to get out of the bullet . The button does not work . Vibrations are strong , but stop at times . In order to turn it off , I have to pry out the batteries . Just simply dropping the batteries in turns it on . Save your money for a better bullet !
 Out of this package this never even worked . I know it was cheap but I expect things to work when I buy them . Not even worth the money to return it . Do n't waste your money .
 HORRIBLE ! Plastic on inside MUST stay covering inside or once u put batteries in it wont turn off ! DOESNT last LONG ! like serious , 4 minutes ! runs outta battery power before u even get to enjoy it . i got a 50 pack of batteries thinking i can have it for a long time . went through half the pack so i threw it away ! NOT strong at all ! 7 speeds but not powerful . can barely feel it ! i would have loved to have a working toy ! and , didnt come with instructions . had to google how to take out batteries
 Its pleasurable but Battery dies very fast . Most of the time it wouldnt turn on . 1hen its not acting up -LRB- which is 90 % of the time -RRB- its decent .
 Do n't waste your money on this because it came to me broken and the paint started to flack off . Not worth a dime .

 We 're recommended to have 3-4000mg of Potassium a day . A banana has 300 + mg . The pill is not even a drop in the bucket . Not worth taking in such a small quantity . Much better to just eat right .
 I hate these sponges - they are too rough to use like normal sponges . They do not hold water like other sponges - I am trying to get rid of them now - they scratch regular kitchen surfaces .
 I had high hopes for this product . However , it simply does not work . There is no active ingredient that helps psoriasis . It did absolutely nothing but moisturize . It also contains fragrance which is ridiculous for a skin condition like psoriasis . I 'd pass on this one .
 My psoriasis may have been a little lighter using this , but my skin also got kind of dried out and salty feeling . Will be moving on to something else .
 I ordered this hoping it would live up to some of its reviews . As anyone with psorasis knows what works for one may not work for someone else . I have a good size patch on my ankle and across the front of my foot . My knee and my fore arm . Didnt do anything for my knee and arm these spots are not that bad small patches just kind of starting . However the hot spot on my ankle it ended up burning when applied . I figured maybe thats normal . But it actually got more red and irritated .
 Bought this cream for a relative who has psoriasis , due to Diabetes . He has been using this now for a few weeks and so far no change in the the condition . Was also surprised by the size of the bottle , very small , is enough for maybe 2-3 weeks tops , if used sparingly .
 I bought this product b/c the reviews were great . I used all of it and still see NO improvement . Was a waste of my money .

 the item came in with no box at all . i have no way of knowing if the items were used or not . the item was advertised in a box and the expectation at least for me is i should be getting what was pictured but alas nothing of that sort happened . definitely will not buy from that outfit again . ever !!
 This product came in a plastic zip lock bag . No box and worse no directions . I did n't have a clue , so I called the Accu-Check help line . Had a little hard time convincing them I did n't have THEIR meter , but finally got down to the MultiClix . Well , you can forget alternate site testing . I can stick my forearm all day with this thing and wo n't draw a drop . I 'll go back to my Freestyle and get all the blood I need . Do n't buy unless you like sticking your fingers . The lancet cartridges plastered with `` Not for Retail Sale '' warnings . What 's with that ?
 The product was two weeks from expiring and he knew I could not use them up in two weeks and still sent the two boxes I ordered.and packed them together and still charged me $ 6.95 a box . I sent him an e-mail and he was rude he told me they were given to him and he thought someone could use them at only $ 0.25 a box but charged me $ 13.90 shipping when he sent them together for only $ 2.73 for both . He went on to tell me that is what Amazon recommended to charge for shipping . He should have put the expiration date on the description of the lancets I would not have ordered them at all with only two weeks before they expired . I also ask him to refund and pay too return well I still have them and he has my $ 14.40 .
 Item arrived in a very timely manner . -LRB- today , 12/20/12 -RRB- Unfortunately I use one strip per day and the pack of 100 expire the end of February , 2013 . New glucose meters do not allow usage of strips after their expiration date . Will end up discarding about 40 strips , almost 1/2 of the order .
 I 've been poking my fingers for about 30 years and my hide is getting pretty tough . These lancets do n't penetrate my skin much at all . They might work for people with small fingers and the ones just starting on the road to diabetes .
 Package is crushed , torn and missing part of the front , side , and back of package . I do not trust that the product is sterile .
 This product was suggested with the Accu-Check aviva plus meter on Amazon but the lancet drum that came with this product is bigger than the the meter . It was a complete waste . I wish I could return this back to the supplier .
 My item is no box , I do n't know used or new one . And they said 102 each -LRB- lancets -RRB- inside but I see only 24 lancets . http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews?ie=UTF8&action=preview
 The expire date of the item was not specified . It is expired in one month .
 We have had a couple of these tubs for bathing our disabled son.The latest was the new improved one for sale here . After 3 uses the hose coupling came apart spilling water everywhere and the tub could not be repaired . We also found the new shape combersome and too high . After owning so many of these tubs with problems from seams giving way to the hose falling off we have decided to look for a better solution to bathing our disabled son . If better made this could be a good bathing solution .
 This was recommended to me and I was looking forward to trying to get some semblance of control over my daughters colds that she would bring home from daycare . I was happy to find this on amazon and ordered it . I wanted to purchase the father johns that did NOT include the dextromethophan -LRB- active ingredient -RRB- . I thoroughly researched the two different types and again was pleases that amazon had that specific product . Unfortunately , it was not amazon who sold it but a third party vendor -LRB- OTCRX4U -RRB- . They sent me the wrong one ... the one with the active ingredient -LRB- red box not the orange one -RRB- . :--LRB- I am now having to go through the process of trying to get the to return or exchange it for the product that I ordered . They are claiming that they sent me the right product but if they paid attention to the box rather than the vague amazon description they would realize that they are mistaken . I will NEVER order anything from a third party vendor off amazon again !!!
 The zombie flavor is just gross . The chap stuck its selfs is smooth and nice but I could n't get over the smell of this flavor .
 It does n't taste or smell like Grand Marnier I was very disappointed . I would rather have my chapstick in cherry flavor . Atleast It has a taste .
 This spray burned my baby everytime I tried to use it.He cryed until I wiped it off.Then there were red welt 's all over his bottom.I do n't want to rate this product but I have to or it wo n't publish this.Save your baby 's bottom and do n't use this .
 I have been a loyal Beanpod customer for years . I absolutely LOVE the pomegranate scent and Earthly Embrace scent . I have purchased my pomegranate scent from 2 different places and received 2 different scents . Even though they are properly labeled , colored and the exact same size - they smell nothing of the same . I contacted Beanpod Candles and they assured me they have not changed the scent formula , but the proof is in the wax . Buyer beware . Smell your candles before you burn them and find out the return policy . I do n't know who is responsible for this but it seems no one knows what is going on and what the reason is for 2 different scents . Very disappointing . Beanpod did n't even offer to make amends for this in any way . The distributor offered to take back the ones I have not burned , as long as I pay for shipping . 4-5 25 oz candles can get pretty heavy / $ $ $ $ . Does n't make any sense to bother returning . I 'd probably get about 3 % of my money back in the end .
 The lemon citrus scent is weak compared to the other scents out there . On a brighter note , the candle itself is long-lasting .
 We love Beanpod candles and have ordered from many different companies and the last 4 do notburn like they are suppose to . The wax still remains about 1 inch around the inside of the glassand does not melt or give off the lemon smell . Are these old ? Beanpod candles are the best and we have never had a problem with these candles ? Will probably not order from this company again .
 I 've been searching high and low for a green-tea scented candle . I have found a lot of `` green tea/citrus '' and scents like that , but not just simply `` green tea '' . So when I found this one , I bought it right away . None of the other reviews I read , even negative ones , seemed to mention Beanpod candles smelling gross . So I bought it . Candles cost too much as it is , but when I spend 20 bucks and then get something like this , I 'm very disappointed.It did not smell like green tea in the slightest . The best I can come up with to describe the smell -LRB- which I could smell before even opening my package when it came in the mail -RRB- , was some cross between AXE Body Spray and campground latrine disinfectant . It stung the nostrils . Just awful . I do n't know how anyone could find this scent enjoyable , let alone claim that it smells anything like green tea .
 I purchased the Beanpod Patchouli scented candle and I am very disappointed . It has been burning for hours and there is absolutely NO fragrance emanating from it at all . Also , it seems to be burning only in the middle . I have purchased these Beanpod candles years ago from a store and always loved them , especially the Patchouli scent . The store in our area stopped selling them , I found this on-line and made the purchase . I WILL NOT be buying another Beanpod candle again . I could have gone to a discount store for a crappy candle and spent a lot less money .
 I bought this candle after I was told that these were the best smelling and stronger than yankee candles . I have to say , I can barely smell this candle at all . I am VERY disappointed in this purchase . I got the Pumpkin Pie scented one .
 This was my initial Beanpod candle purchase . The mixed reviews caused me concern , but the positive ones swayed my decision to purchase this expensive candle.I ordered the Honeysuckle scented candle . When it arrived I was immediately concerned as there was no fragrance surrounding it even though it was 75 degrees Fahrenheit.The scent of this candle is a cross between dog urine and cat urine - not ANYWHERE NEAR the sweet nectar scent of honeysuckle!Planned ` obsolescence ' is built into these candles as the wax remains circumferentially 1/2-inch on the glass . It does not melt . I will not order any Beanpod items again . I am VERY disappointed in this purchase . I agree with another reviewer , the Beanpod candles smell gross . The candles are pricey and the scent is horrid . I too burned the candle for hours thinking that the wax on the sides would melt and that maybe as it went deeper into the candle that the scent would improve , but it did not improve .

 The site states that the product is a `` Set of 6 of the most commonly used frequencies contains the following forks
 This product is mesrepresented . I ordered this thinking I was getting a set of tuning forks to teach my child about sound and sound waves . I only got one fork .
 They show an image of the tunning forks with case and then sell you one tunning fork which is inferior to any product I have every receieved . Do n't buy from them if you can help it !
 Unfortunately I was in a rush to buy a Christmas present for my child 's teacher . We came up with the idea of a `` set '' of tuning forks for the Sound Unit he was teaching . We saw the price , we saw the product picture , and we ordered it . Usually I scroll down and read reviews before purchasing , but I did n't this time and I am sorry I did n't . As previous people stated , I was annoyed that I received only one fork when thinking I was getting a set . Now I am stuck because it will cost me money if I return it and I would be out a fork and shipping . Amazon needs to revamp this product description and picture because it is misleading . The set is actually in the 50 dollar range not 5 dollars . So if you were to order , READ CAREFULLY to ensure that you are purchasing EXACTLY what you think you are ordering . This is the first time I have ever been dissatified with a purchase through Amazon .
 The product description state that it is a set of tuning forks . I just received one tuning fork . As a teacher , I need a set of tuning forks to teach my 4th graders about sound . This is disappointing and would have though amazon would have taken care of any issue with the seller after so many bad reviews .
 The description clearly states that you are purchasing a `` set '' . All you get is a single tuning fork . Perhaps the $ 60 package will include a full set .
 Product DescriptionEvaluate hearing and vibratory sensation . Set of 6 of the most commonly used frequencies contains the following tuning forks -LRB- 128 , 256 , 512 , 1024 , 2048 , 4095 cps -RRB- . This is description of what I should have been sent . Instead I was sent 1 small unweighted tuning forl . . I will not be ordering from this place again . And wlll complain to amason itself to allowing this continue going on from this seller.sKim
 I need to pay attention to the fine print and reviews . I , too , am a teacher , and did not realize I was ordering just ONE tuning fork , when the image clearly shows a boxed set . I am not even sure what `` 512 cps weighted '' means . I hope I can use this tuning fork for its intendend purpose . I wish the company would have been more clear with its advertising and description .
 When I received the tuning fork it was broken ! If you are looking for a tuning fork and actually need it to work , DO NOT buy it from them . They are super cheap for a reason . Guess I learned my lesson .
 I was surprised at the little jar ! I guess I did n't read the size when I ordered ... anyway - it didnt help at all . I went back to another product that I use that keeps it -LRB- rosacea -RRB- under control . I had high hopes , but this product could n't meet them : -LRB-
 Ordered the cream and it does nothing to control rosacea . It is ineffective at best or sometimes it seemed it made the condition worse . Disappointed : -LRB-
 I purchased this product and began using it two times daily as directed . I used it for 3 weeks with no improvement in my rosacea.When I tried to return the product to the seller , they refused to take it back because it had been used . I can not remember how many times I returned lipstick or makeup to a department store with no questions asked.Since then I have purchased and used Skin Medica 's product . It is much better quality . Initially it burns a bit when you first start using it bu it quickly goes away , and most important , it works very well in clearing up the rosacea . It 's more expensive but well worth it in my opinion .
 i would n't be surprised to find out most of the positive reviews are fake . Used it overnight and when i woke up my skin was dry and flaky where i had put it on . Put it on in the morning and by lunch time i need to use something else as it causes my skin to flake . Wo n't buy it again and would not recommend it .
 After spinal surgery I started wearing sturdy shoes . Since I have wide toes and a narrow arch and heel , I thought these gel mats might help with heel comfort . However , after just a few minutes one of the heel mats slid sideways and was very uncomfortable . This `` one-size-fits-all '' did not fit in my shoes .
 We bought the gel inserts and my husband only was wearing one and now it looks like a pancake . There is no more gel inside of it .
 With both of my parents having had heel spurs , I was a ticking time bomb . It exploded this fall when , out of desperation , I took on a crappy office job at Sears.I thought I had all the bases covered ... a brand new pair of Propet , flat dress shoes with a `` 2,000 mile '' warranty and then BAM ! My first heel pain EVER , within two weeks of taking the crappy job.Anyone with this problem understands you want INSTANT relief . If you 're on your feet -LRB- and trust me at Sears , as with any retailer , you WILL BE , even in an office setting -RRB- , you 're in for a world of pain without the right product for your heel.I 'm a size 8 1/2 and decided to try the men 's version because most products made for women look more like some form of foot binding than they do suitable for an American woman 's foot.I first bought a pair of Dr. Scholl 's Heel Pain Relief Orthotics and they help immediately . But I had been impressed by all the comments about Tuli 's so I felt as though I could improve upon the level of comfort I obtained from the Dr. Scholl 's . So I bought Tuli 's Heavy Duty Heel cups since they were the only product available locally ... they were okay , but were too floppy and high cut for my needs . They also slipped around in my shoes . I 'd say these are better suited for a boot.Then I bought a pair of these highly touted Gel Polar Bear 's , thinking this would be , as they say
 Within 50 steps these heel cups rotate 90 degrees and become very uncomfortable in the shoe . I do n't know about you , but I do n't have time to keep taking off my shoes at work and realigning them.By the other style of heel cushion Tuli 's makes here : http://www.amazon.com/Tulis-Heavy-Duty-Large-175lbs/dp/B000MSZT7O/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=hpc&qid;=1275889277&sr;=8-1
 Cups are not worth the money they are soft and do n't do the job advertisedvery unhappy with them and had to reorder Tuli 's hard plastic cups later inanother order do n't waste your money.Cups are to flimsy and to much jelly .
 inserts slip too easily - do not stay in place . I find that a full insole works best
 I 'm sorry but these things did nothing for my heel pain . They are n't even very cushiony .

 Dear Tiffany , I promise that I will not try to be frugal and will always , always come to you to have my legs waxed . You see , I got this kit from a friend . She tried to use it on her underarms and after doing half of one , vowed she would never , never wax anything again . But I was willing to give it a whirl ; after all , I 've been waxed a number of times and know what to expect . What I do n't expect is that the wax will never take on the `` thin , creamy '' texture described on the box , my kitchen will turn into a sticky mess , the wax wo n't peel off my legs at least half the time , the number of muslin strips will be completely insufficient for a half leg job , the wax removal product in the box wo n't be of any help , and that I will end up covering myself in cornstarch in order to keep from sticking to the dog , my husband , the sheets and the furniture . What a nightmare . I still have a thick crust-o-wax on my calf that I ca n't get off for love nor money . I may have to go to the waxing salon to be de-waxed . -LRB- How embarassing is that ? -RRB- So , Tiffany , I promise , promise , promise that I will always let you wax my legs in the future ... if you promise not to laugh !
 This is in no way a Ladies size 4 , more like a 5 or 6 . Did n't fit too well in my Asics either , but it seems like it would be comfortable in any other shoe that I could remove the insole to .
 This product does not work . I tried it a ton of times and followed the instructions exactly . Left a ton of hair behind and after the pain of ripping it off I was disappointed . I would not buy this product stick with the muslin strips and original wax .
 This first aid kit looks great , and is ideal for the 3-5 person hiking/camping trips that I take with friends and with family . However , the item shipped to me from Amazon was full of expired medical items . I purchased a similar item from a local outdoor-ing retailing . Give yourself enough time to expect a refund before getting a valid item .
 All of the ointments/pills expired in mid to late 2007 . Do n't waste your money/time with this seller .
 Opened the box from Amazon today , saw through the bag that some of the meds expired in 2007 -LRB- ! -RRB- Sent it back and will build my own kit with current meds .
 I took this on a small fishing boat trip since it was an inner bag which featured a leakproof , waterproof and airtight seal . My small fishing boat took on water and I was swimming for land . Fortunately the lightweight outer bag survived.Upon opening it , many items were out of date or just did n't work , like the band-aids , medical tape and oinkment . This Kit is also not fireproof as I found out when I fell asleep by my campfire and it caught fire .

 I thought I 'd give this a try , as I never seem to be able to find cold , sugar-based wax at any of my local drugstores . For some bizarre reason , upon applying this to my leg and pressing either a muslin or paper/fiber paper to the `` wax '' , it stayed on my leg when I did the usual `` pull skin taut , quickly remove strip in direction opposite of hair growth '' move . I thought maybe the `` pre-waxing '' alcohol based lotion they provided was causing these results , so I repeated the process on my other leg , omitting the lotion . Alas , I was still stuck with an inferior product.I 've been inflicting this on myself for years and have had very successful results with other brands -LRB- that seem to only be available in Canada -RRB- , as well as middling results with others . I certainly would n't bother with this line again .
 I ordered this for a birthday , recieved email that it had shipped and one that it had been discontinued so i called the company about it left countless messages trying to figure out if i was recieving it or not since i had recieved a tracking number and no return calls and never recieved it .

 The pair I received were comfortable but the carbon fiber separated from the foam material after less than a week of use .
 At first it felt like lube while rubbing it on the female and then warmed up and smelled like Pear but about ten minutes later the smell went horrible . I will not use any more out of the bottle or buy any further of these bottles . I would have expected the smell to last for a long while but i was mistaken .
 Not only does this product NOT work ... it makes a terrible sticky mess in it 's wake . A complete waste of time and money .
 There are no natural cures on the cds . Chapter 12 , the final cd , is decieving titled `` cures to every disease '' but only tells you that the FTC has censored him , and you have join the website -LRB- monthy membership $ 10 -RRB- to get the cures . I feel like I have been misled and decieved by Trudeau . Do n't waste your money on this cd set .

 This is now the second at home product I have tried and it 's horrendous . I am on the hunt for a cheap , good way to wax my bikini area and legs and everyone raved about the hard wax . Unfortunately , I did n't read the review of the sugar wax before I bought it . Such a waste of money and I ca n't even return it . Absolutely NO hair comes off and I pulled several times in the same area even though it advises you not to . Additionally , there were no instructions noted in English -- at all . I had to go on online to try to see how and if I was doing it right . Overall , I 'm pretty disappointed and now trying to figure out how I can get rid of this entire kit . Such a waste of money .

 I tried this product thinking it would make my teeth nice and white . It did n't do a thing for me . Not even half a single shade lighter . This is a bogus product .
 If this had worked , this would have been a perfect solution . But , it did n't . Waste of time and money . It might work for others , but it did n't for me . The first tube was so messy it spilled and I wasted most of it .

 I received a 60 count bottle instead of the 90 that I paid for . Also there is no Goats milk and probiotic cultures as the website claims.Garden of Life Antioxidant Formula , Radical Fruits , Caplets , 90 caplets
 ordered 2 bottles but only received one . called so many times and always go to voice mailnever call back . wrote the email to sales department and through amazon.com , never heard from them
 The compass does not seem to work . I did n't open the plastic case . I just turned the case in a few different directions and the compass would not point correctly .
 Lots of artificial flavors -- the fruit , the fake sugar -- overall , just ... yuck . The kids and adults are having a hard time getting these down . Maybe if you 're used to flintstones or other commercial vitamins , these would be okay . We were taking naturally-flavored Solaray previously , and these are truly wretched by comparison . I was lured in by price . Not again.Vitamin-wise , I guess these are okay , but light on mineral content . Also note that these do not have iron .
 I had cervical fusion @ C5-C6 w/a plate , also shoulder surgery.I still have lots of problems & thought this would be a nice comfort at times , but it folds in half & clumps up around your neck . Nothing like the hard collar -LRB- which is awful , but efficent .
 This item might have been okay , but it did not fit my boyfriend . He has bad degenerative neck disease and I thought this would help keeping his neck warm . I should have been wary of the one size fits all aspect of this product . The true problem is that I attempted to contact the company in the manner and within the time frame that they wished for to be able to return this AND never got a response back . Anybody want to have it for free ? It is of zero use to us.Maria

 I received the shipment quickly ; however , I was a little disappointed when I opened the box as it was only a 5 ounce package . I bought another color of sprinkles from a different company , paid the same price and got 16 ounces . The seller did not specify in the description how many ounces was included in the price . I took the risk because I needed the sprinkles and could n't find them . I will know next time to ask the question before purchasing .

 Up until now I 've only used alcohol based aftershaves , but I decided to try this for a change.What I like is that the smell is pleasant , really pleasant . It strikes a nice balance between being too weak and overpowering.What I do n't like is the lack of any kind of sensation when I put it on . No burning , no cooling , no relief . It just feels like I 'm rubbing on a scented lotion . It also leaves an oily residue on your skin.Really it 's just preference . I can see how other people prefer this product , but not me .
 I have used countless different facial moisturizers and aftershave balms . This is easily the worst . While it has a good scent , it does not fully absorb into your skin . It will leave an oily film on your skin making it look and feel greasy . Just terrible given the price point . If you are in the market for a good post-shave moisturizer , for high end product both Anthony for Men and Jack Black make great products . I even like Olay 's Regenerist . If you only want to spend $ 5 , use Every Man Jack 's post-shave moisturizer . I can not stress enough how bad this product is . It is a HUGE step down from the quality of the shaving cream . Nobody wants a greasy/oily face , especially when the product is $ 30 - $ 40 .
 This product was reformulated sometime in the last six months . The scent now bears no resemblance to the old sandalwood scent . It smells like sweet baby powder . The consistency is noticeably thinner , and it is now a brown color . TAOS used to be one of the best , warmest sandalwood scents around , and now , this product should not even have the word sandalwood among its descriptors or ingredients .
 First of all , I 'm not a dermatologist , I 'm just a heterosexual guy with sensitive skin who has tried many products and done a lot of research in the search of the right products . I offer reviews of Clinique , zirh , menscience , art of shaving and baxter of California , hope my reviews are helpful.The art of shaving has to be my least favorite skincare product line . Their products are over prized , no samples or option of returning products if client is not satisfied is given.I prefer gels , this balm was too irritating and thick . the shave cream is great , so you really do n't need it anyways
 EDIT
 I have been buying these for quite some time and was pleased with them until my most recent order . Alas , the formula appears to have changed and now there is a * very * strong ginger smell and taste to the caplets . I know ginger is good for me and I do n't mind it as an ingredient but I absolutely do NOT want to taste it . Even if I gulp down an entire tall glass of water I ca n't escape the biting ginger flavor left in my mouth . Digestive enzymes do n't do any good if you are reluctant to swallow them so I 'm going to try `` Doctor 's Best '' and hope it 's a good product .
 I gave this product a try to aid in digestion and my Crohn 's . I tried different doses from high to low but it kept yielding the same results ... severe abdominal gas ! I experimented with the product for 2 weeks and my body was unable to acclimate to it . I have tried other Garden of Life products with great results but this one , IMHO , is not worth it .
 I have bought this product many times and this was definitely a bad batch . The caplets were more friable than others I have bought . However , as the bottle seals were intact , and it was not even close to the expiration date , I attributed the product 's condition to being roughly shipped . The more I used it , however , the more it did n't smell right , look right . It almost seemed as if it had been water damaged and then dried out . Upon closer examination , it appeared that the Lot # had been altered . At this point it was too late to do much about it , as half the product was used up , but I will not buy from this seller in the future .
 This may be a good product but the caplets are so large I can not swallow them . I tried chewing them and the taste was just so horrible I had to spit it out . I do not recommend this product for anyone who can not swallow very large pills .
 I drink a glass of these super green powders every day , and they really work . I have more energy , and I do n't even get a cold anymore . I have tried different powders . None of them taste very good , but it is still OK to drink them mixed in water . I like to use water so I do not add calories every day just for these green drinks . I am sure this green powder is of similar quality as the others , but the taste is so bad , that I gaged when I drank it the first time . I did not give up right away though . I tried for a few more days , but eveytime I swallowed this , I got nauseated from the taste , and felt sick for about one hour . I gave up . This is so vile , it is just not worth it . There are many other good products out there which taste a lot better .
 My immune system was so low this last winter I had to do something . Being a picky eater , I could n't just completely change my diet overnight , but I did start to change it some . I have tried daystar botanicals , ALIVE ! , and now this Garden of Life product . The other products worked well to get my immunity up -LRB- I have n't had so much as a sneeze or cough since January -RRB- , but I thought I would look for a product that did n't cost as much per bottle -LRB- free shipping too ! -RRB- . I have now taken the product twice -LRB- mixed with apple juice -RRB- and both times I have had to really focus in order to keep it down -LRB- remember the picky eater thing -RRB- . I am going to try this for a few more days just to really give it a chance . I was impressed by the ingredients and would like to see if there is a difference in the way I feel compared to the other products . I will try to update this in the next week .
 my first EVER one star review.this stuff is so far beyond vile I could not recommend it to anyone with functional taste buds . I 've eaten dog , live crustaceans , insects and STILL cant find words to describe how bad this stuff is .
 I like this actual product , however , I placed this order a week ago and it has n't even begun to ship yet !?!? What the heck ??! And I have no idea whom to call or contact ... verrry frustrating . I guess I will just cancel this order and pay the $ 18 more from Whole Foods . Why advertise something as being &#34; in stock &#34; ??
 The label on the container says `` gluten free '' , but like a lot of things , if you have problems with gluten intolerance then check the ingredient label . There you will find wheat and barley grasses , which in of themselves do not trigger reactions , but can contain seeds , which are the source of the gluten . Are you going to tell me they catch every seed that goes through?I bought this as an addition to my morning protein shake and from the first day I started using it I felt HORRIBLE ! Fatigue , diarhea , nausea , all the symptoms that told me I had consumed something with gluten . I finally tracked down the only possible culprit , which is this product . ANYTHING that includes any form of wheat or barley is not safe to eat for a person with gluten issues . The fast and loose labeling protocols for the food industry have once again done us a great disservice .
 Read the label carefully and consult with your medical doctor.When I took this product I had the worst cystic acne of my life . Turns out that these ingredients
 My Garden of Life product I purchased was stale/Old . I buy this product all the time and I saw the reviews of the company I bought it from and felt it would be a fresh product . I was wrong .
 I wish I had a better way to say it ... other than YUCK !!! I have used green powders for years and seem to be pretty tolerant of the flavor and have found ways to make smoothies with them that masks the taste . But this one has me stumped -- no matter what I do I can not mask the flavor of it and can not tolerate it . I suggest you buy a small amount and try it before investing in the large sized one like I did ...
 Tastes awful , expensive , and why not just use pure chlorella and/or spirulina powders ? Those are the best ingredients in this and any other green food supplement/superfood that is worth anything . Kelp , wheatgrass , alfalfa , are great , but not as good as algae powders . I consider them fillers for green drinks and now prefer straight spirulina or chlorella .
 Even with a juice or flavored drink , the over powering taste of alfalfa makes this mix difficult at best to swallow . Different grasses make up this mix . It would have better to see more sea kelp or spinach in this mix .
 I have tried this product at least three separate times . Each time I have the same problem ; I get diarrhea that takes weeks to get rid of . I do n't mind the taste , am confident of the company -LRB- I 've taken their probiotic for years -RRB- but for some reason this particular product , which I would like to take because of its alkaline nature and `` green-ness , '' just causes havoc with my system . I can take a very small amount , like a half teaspoon , without a problem , but if I work up to half a scoop , I get the runs . I 've encountered one other person , a medical professional who has a * very * good diet , who had the same problem.But it wo n't hurt you to give it a try ; just do n't buy a huge quantity to start with . If it works for you , it should be a great product .
 After taking this product , I had to see my cardiologist . It triggered heart palpitations . I 'm still getting over them . Look at the ingredients and make sure -LRB- if you can -RRB- you 're not allergic to something in it . There are sooooo many ingredients , I have no idea of which one caused this . Ugh !!! I pray I get back to normal .
 I bought Perfect Food to up my greens intake and to accompany a detox/cleanse that I am doing . The taste is so bad , I just ca n't keep drinking this stuff ! The first time , I mixed it with some blended veggies and fruits and was able to choke it back . I tried it with plain water and YUCK !!! I tried regular bottled , organic apple juice and NOPE . Finally , I tried mixing it in with unsweetened almond milk . After being close to gagging every time I drank this stuff , I finally gave up . I consider myself pretty tolerable of `` gross '' foods , especially when it comes to better health . But this stuff is just nasty ! On another note , Garden of Life makes an antioxidant berry mix and this one is n't bad at all . But I 'll be looking for another brand of green food to try .
