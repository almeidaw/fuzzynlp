 Sorry to say here but I have very mixed feelings about the R&B ; / soul scene of the past decade or so . For more on that it 's all over my other reviews . Yet there are many releases that stand out in this contemporary R&B ; style as they call it that really make the difference for me -LRB- the 2001 albumAaliyah . And honestly this is n't all that far behind it . Not that it needs to be worn on his sleeve by any means but the fact that Kelly wrote , produced and performed every note on this album is important because at this key juncture in the genre a level of creative control was important to keep the programing dependent music in check . Not only that but considering that this actually qualifies as a follow up to two albums-in this case directly to his 1998 double setRand symbolically to 1993 's 12-Play . When you get right down to it this album is basically a 70 's Marvin Gaye style conceptually linked album where the music and lyrics basically speak the same sensuous language . Upon first impressions this would seem to be just another sexually posturing album based only in the shallowest of sexuality . That is , if you are looking only at the cover portrait and song titles . Once you get into the album you find something very different . Not as heavy on uptempo songs outside the opening title song . Only the Cuban/2-step party hearty `` Fiesta '' is really a strong uptempo jam . Songs such as `` Strip For You '' , `` I Wish '' , `` One me '' , `` I Mean -LRB- I Do n't Mean It -RRB- '' , `` All I Really Want '' and `` The Storm Is Over Now '' are beautifully written -LRB- and often tender -RRB- ballad type numbers with Kelly standing emotionally naked regarding the conflicts of needing fame and how it seperates you from your humanity.It basically takes the modern day R&B ; lifestyle where being a music star is more similar to being a super model sometimes and lays the truths and hopes of the matter out for all to hear . It does so much so that by the end of the album Kelly is actually reminicing about a depart friend in a remix of `` I Wish '' and on some of the cuts a continual references to `` going to church '' to redeem himself , a reoccuring concept for R.Kelly that he 's still following to this day . So this by no means qualifies as a `` retro '' style album since it sits so squarely , even the predominating ballads are in the contemporary idiom . And considering the subject matter of the lyrics that was probably the best choice . Here R.Kelly 's stereotypical hip-hop based R&B ; music , in any tempo goes right along the lyrics questioning the celebrity obsessed music scene perfectly . And even while this contains music you could easily jam or make love to , listening to it will put some interesting thoughts into your mind .
 Listen to the speakers . This man , thru all his trials and tribulations , wrongs and rights , is hands down one of the most talented . This cd came out when I was 13 , and though I was still a virgin it was my favorite album.I am now 24 , devirginized and it is still my favorite album .
 R. Kelly is a very talented R&B artist even though all he seems to talk about is sex . I do n't have any of his earlier works like `` 12 Play '' but I 'm planning to get them later on in the future . But anyway , about this cd
 i bought this cd today and it was hot , hot , hot as expected . r kelly is talented and yo'all need to get this . it takes you back to the days of 12 play . this needs to be in your cd player right next to the joe and carl thomas for good measure -LRB- and pleasure -RRB- and keep your levels up .
 R-Kelly continues to grow as an artist and musician . He continues to represent Chicago 's true talent . From top to bottom this is one of the best R & B works in quite some time . R. shines on nearly all the tracks with his soulful spirit . He follows in the path of all the legends - Marvin Gaye , Al Green , and Sam Cooke . At the same time , R has his own unique style which makes him a trailblazer . This album is a gem and a must-have for all R & B fans .
 As any R Kelly fan knows , `` Kells '' never disappoints . I picked up TP2.Com and found the entire CD pleasing to my ears . The CD has a great play list , the vocals are hot and the beats are the best to groove to . If you are looking for a nice , sultry groove CD to listen to , with the normal R Kelly romantic overtones , this is it . I hope this helps . YMMV ... NEOSOUL
 I remember this album when I was in the 8th grade . I love this CD . this album established him as the most profilic , groundbreaking , and gifted musicians . This album is a blend of smooth talk , soaring vocals , and urban beats that are resonant in every track . This album is his eclectic and triumphant musical journey . This album has been certified 5x Platinum . Remember , this was 2000-2001 .
 TP-2 . com is probably the greatest cd 's that I own . I have had the album for 4 years and I am listening to it as i speak . Its a cd that i can never live without again . R.Kelly is a genuis and I believe i can go out on a huge limb and say he maybe the top 3 or 4 best R&B artist ever . I ca n't wait for his new album TP-3 reloaded .
 I think I like this CD better than 12 play . All of his CD 's sound good because he puts everything into them . I love this man and the way he ahs changed R&B .
 WHAT CAN I SAY THAT HASE N'T ALREADY BEEN SAID ? HE IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE BEST !!! & NO ONE CAN TOP THIS CLASSIC ! THIS IS JUST ONE , OF THE MANY ALBUMS R.KEL HAS PUT OUT , BUT TO ME IT 'S # 1 , THIS IS TRULY A MASTERPIECE . EVERY SONG IS ABSOULTLY AMAZING , I HAVE HEARD THIS ALBUM FROM BEGINING TO END LITERALTY HUNDREDS OF TIMES . IF U DO N'T ALREADY HAVE IT , GET IT NOW !!!! U DO N'T KNOW WHAT YOUR MISSING ; -RRB-
 Now that I have procured your attention , let me just say that R. Kelly 's TP-2 . com is a smash hit !!! Here is a break down of the various tracks , a majority of them were written by R. Kelly -LRB- do n't be surprised by the sort of imagery he presents you with -RRB- 1 -RRB- TP-2
 This is the sexiest album ever.There 's no stopping this man . He shows the freaky and beautiful side of sex . with the opening track `` TP-2 '' and the pulse racing `` R&B Thug '' then the beautiful , sweet , and melodic '' The greatest sex '' and the hot and sexy `` Like a real freak . '' He also gives you a song of remembrance for love ones that were lost with '' I wish '' and `` To all the homies that were lost -LRB- I wish remix -RRB- '' . From there he takes you right back into freaky mode with the famous hit '' feelin on yo booty '' . He ends the album with the uplifting '' The storm is over now . '' This album will most definitely take you on a journey . the journey begans with having a freaky good time , to making love , to mourning those who were lost , to grinding on the dance floor then to giving you hope and inspriation.this is one of the greatest R&B albums ever made ...
 This album is a Classic . I always find myself listen to it everytime I can . R.Kelly just create a masterpiece on his own . For me His best album . My favorites songs are
 Any emotion you feel R. Kelly will touch it with this masterpiece of an r & b album . I know R. kelly can be a little overally sexual with his lyrics but overall this album is really good . I recommend it to any who likes r & b artist like Ginuwine . Best track is probably `` I wish '' which touches anyone who ever lost someone they truly love . Do n't let the parental advisory sticker stop you from buying this album . This has to be the best r & b album this year and probably for awhile because you do n't see a lot of r & b artists like R.Kelly scoring this big ...
 When R.Kelly was writting , arranging , producing and recording this Classic , probably he was AT HIS BEST IN HIS SEX LOVING WAY.He created himself the Best R&B ; Album that Ever been Recording in Music History . Only if was n`t for haters to try to ruin his life , he will be in commercials doing
 Words ca n't describe this cd except , classic !! It does n't get any better than this . R. Kelly really put it down on this cd . If do n't have this what are you waiting on . For the sake of music go buy it now !!!
 I only have to say that this is the Best R&B Album Ever Made and R.Kelly is the Best Performer , Producer , Songwriter , Arranger , Multi-Instrumentalist and Remixer in the World . He ` s at the top of the R&B Game with this Classic . All of the songs on it are Unbelievable . If you love baby making music , THIS IS THE BEST OPTION FOR YOU . DO N`T TELL ME THAT YOU DID N`T HAVE IT ... BECAUSE U ARE MISSING THE BEST MUSIC OF YOUR LIFE , BY THE BEST MUSICIAN.FOR SURE , BUY ABOUT 3 COPIES AND BRING SOME LOVE TO YOUR LIFE !
 OH MAN , this is da first R&B CD that I have in my life before of that I was n`t too much to the R&B / Soul Genre . I bought it because of the Phenomenal single `` I Wish '' . And when listen to all the album I was excited and satisfied to have so much soul and heartfel melodies in one complete CD . R.Kelly is one of the Best Artists on the Planet . You got to love him and all his awesome music . NOW , BECAUSE OF HIM AND THE BLAZING `` TP-2 . COM '' I LOVE TO DEATH R&B FLAVA MUSIC . Is worth ALL of your money . Buy two copies . I HAVE THREE OF IT .
 This is basic as R.Kelly ` s TP-2 . COM is THE BEST R&B ; ALBUM OF ALL TIME ... PERIOD . R. is the MICHAEL JORDAN OF R&B. ; And this Album is his BEST PERFORMANCE EVER , A HUGE CLASSIC . Every Single Song can just be that ... A HIT SINGLE . From his `` TP-2 '' First Track to the Last Touching , Great , Soulful , Beatiful Gospel Song `` The Storm Is Over Now '' . From # 1-19 is only music at his Best . When you think that the Unbelievable Hit Single `` I Wish '' Song is only a Standout here , when you buy the Album you find out , THE WHOLE ALBUM IS THE BEST THAT YOU CAN GET ...

 my favorite song is i decide because that it is a true love song that you can relate to in real life because that r kelly has been in the music business every since 1992 and that r kelly is still blowing up after all of the year and that i have all of his cd and that im gon na keep on buying r kelly music for the year come .
 R. Kelly has done it again . TP-2 . com throws down the slam dunk of R&B , proving that R. Kelly is the top artist out there . From his soaring slow jams like `` I do n't mean it '' to his ghetto ballads like `` I wish -LRB- remix -RRB- '' R. has created a diamond . So many artists out there today are about money and bling , but Kelly has shown he sings from his soul . This CD is going to be hard to top by any artist . Got to give him love .
 Go and get the Greatest Album ever made by a R&B ; singer . Simply R.Kelly is nothing short of a phenomenon . He has the ability to make everyone forget of the problems of life by just making soulful relaxing sensual songs for ladies and men.This is the only album that I listen to it from the start to the end without touching any buttom , just because it does n`t get bored neither a second . ALL THE 19 SONGS ARE PURE HOT CLASSIC GEMS .

 Definely this is the album to buy , this is the best work that R.Kelly has done . For me , THE MOST REALIZE R&B ; ALBUM EVER MADE AND THATS FOR SURE . I really dont care what people -LRB- HATERS -RRB- are saying , R.KELLY is and forever will be a LEGEND , A CLASSIC SINGER , SONGWRITTER , ARRANGER , PRODUCER , REMIXER AND MULTI-INSTRUMENTALIST ... However ALL THE 19 SONGS ARE RED HOT , BUT THE MOST HEARD BY ME ARE
 Not one artist cant make music like R.Kelly does.He has a unique talent that is more than amazing.His production , writting , arranging and performing skills make him what he is right now , THE KING OF R&B MUSIC ! . This Album is by far his best work , WELL ! , THE BEST OF ALL R&B ALBUMS AS I SAID . All the 19 tracks -LRB- Produced , Written , Arranged and Perfomed by R.Kelly -RRB- are slamin gems -LRB- Even the interlude '' The Real R.Kelly -RRB- . I can hear this CD from the start to the end without skipping any song -LRB- Im not that kind of person that do this -RRB- , because every track is HOT . Since I bought this copy from day one , I hear it every day . It is so wonderful , hipnotize and contagious that my girlfriend love it so much that insisted me to buy a copy for her too and she also listen it almost every day.My favorites songs are
 This album is just another compliment of Kelly 's talent . TP-2 . com is just that . It has a mixer of 12play and R . He has just elevated his talent to a new level . Out of all of R. Kelly 's albums , none sound the same . In every album , you must listen to it twice it begin to vibe with it . This is because he is talent at it 's finest . With alittle twist of thug passion , you got yourself a platnuim album , all over again . From `` feelin on yo booty '' to The `` Greatest Sex '' This entire album is nothing but the finest ... . Bottom line . He 's not trying to sell dreams , nor hop , ... and does it very well . This is a must get album . No need to skip sounds or program your cd player , just pop the disk in and let it spin and the songs will do the rest !
 I loved R. Kelly 's ` Born into the 90 's ' , '12 Play ' and his third release ` R. Kelly ' Then he went crazy . He ` believed he could fly ' and had the NERVE to record a song with CELINE DION . I knew he 'd lost it then . ` R ' I just hated . BUT HE 'S RETURNED WITH TP2 . It 's a great work !! I can actually listen to it straight through without skipping anything . I must admit that I stop before ` The Storm is Over Now ' . It has that Celine Dion , I believe I can fly sound . My favorites are
 After droppin ' 4 CDs , 3 of them solo and one with Public Announcement , R Kelly is back once again with `` TP-2 . Com '' . His CD , `` 12 Play '' is what got R Kelly well known in the business . The slow jams on that CD were tunes to remember like `` Your Body 's Callin '' , `` It Seems Like You 're Ready '' , `` Bump & Grind '' , and `` 12 Play '' . On `` R Kelly '' it seems that R Kelly was struggling through his life in general , his music and his religious beliefs . He still had classic songs like `` Down Low -LRB- Nobody Has To Know -RRB- '' , `` Baby , Baby , Baby , Baby '' , and `` Trade In My Life '' . On his last CD , the double CD `` R '' , R Kelly was back to his old self . Some of the songs , because it was a double CD , were considered filler but he still had songs to remember like `` When A Woman 's Fed Up '' , `` If I Could Turn Back The Hands Of Time '' , `` One Man '' and `` I Am Your Angel '' w/Celine Dion . `` TP-2 . Com '' is basicaly `` 12 Play '' 2000 . As you listen to his latest CD , you will be reminded of his breakthrough CD throughout this . R Kelly , is definitely back to his old self again and his fans should like it . Things get started off right with `` Strip For You '' . R Kelly tries to switch things up a bit by playing a role that is usually played by the woman . I am sure that the ladies will not be disappointed by this one . Other gems are `` The Greatest Sex '' , which is kind of misleading because it 's more of a love song , `` I Decided '' , the 1st single `` I Wish '' , `` Just Like That '' , and `` I Do n't Mean It '' . My favorite song is `` A Woman 's Threat '' , which has R Kelly reminding men about the excuses they try to use to not treat their women right . This song will remind people of Joe 's `` Treat Her Like A Lady '' . R Kelly has really impressed me with this release . The writing and production are as good as any of his previous releases . Some people will say that this is the same material that everyone is covering right now , but nobody can do it like Mr. Kelly .
 I am sure there were more people at the music store yesterday than there were at the polls . The world of music seems to stop when r. Kelly drops . It is the hottest R&B Cd this year since Carl Thomas . R.K. comes off with music that you can make love to - Ghetto Style . When you add this one to the Kelly collection , get ready to go half on a baby . This is a must buy .
 I would like to start this off by saying I have read some of these so-called reviews and was very disappointed to read what some of these people -LRB- haters -RRB- had to say . TP2.COM is Kelly 's best work to date . People said the album had too much of this and not enough of that , I 'm like come on if any of you had the opportunity to do what this man is doing you would n't be complaining . This is a real R&B album-after hearing Joe 's and Carl Thomas 's albums I was happy to have R.Kelly grace us with the birth of TP2.COM . now , for the people who have n't copped this cd let me tell you about some of the show stoppers.Of course 1 . I Wish-simply beautiful . the most touching song on this album . The lyrics are heart-felt . I know everybody has heard this song so you know what i 'm saying when i call this a masterpiece . 2 . The Greatest Sex . Now some might get the wrong idea or think this song is going to be raunchy by the name . But , actually it 's a romantic song . For fellas who can sit back and think about that special lady who put it on him .3 . Just Like That . An all around feel good song that everybody can vibe to . Relaxing and to the point , he puts it down with some beautiful lyrics `` just like that '' .4 . I Decided . A song in which a man `` decides '' what is more important . All the men out there who want to know the steps to having a better relationship need to listen to this track .5 . My favorite - I Do n't Mean It . Anybody in a relationship will be able to connect with this song . Sometimes in relationships we tend to say or do things that we `` do n't mean '' . Kelly just put everything we have in our heads and hearts that we want to take back . Get ready for some good make up time with your partner if you get into an argument and then play them this song after everything has settled down . Kelly truly out did himself on this one .6 . Feelin On Yo Booty . This gets you to thinkin about when you were at a party dancing with the girl you 've been wanting to get next to . She 's feelin you and you 're feelin her . The song the dj 's playin is perfect -LRB- just think at that moment everything is perfect . -RRB- This song is definately a show stopper . Trust me you 'll love it.If I have n't convinced you to go get this cd then i do n't know what else to say . It 's worth every cent you will pay for it , trust me . TP2.COM belongs in your cd collection trust me it does n't get any better than this on the R&B tip , Kelly has rhythm and blues on lock . Enough of this-Go cop this cd .
 I was never much of an r and b fan till i heard this album . R. Kelly is an amazing artist and this is his best work yet . There are very few album where i can listen to every song from start to finish but this is one of them . If you have any doubts about getting this album BUY IT . you wont regret it .
 If you really want to know about this album , READ THIS
 I dont know what to say except that this album is amazing . I used to listen to mostly hip hop until I bought this album . Since then i 've gotten more and more into r & b because of him . I can listen to this album all the way through from the first track to the last track . This is one my favorite cds that I own . If your not sure about buying this album . Buy it.Its more than worth the 16 dollars
 I am R. Kelly 's # 1 fan . This album is off the hook . I gave him four stars and not five , because 99 % of the songs are about sex , but what can you expect from a title that 's called twelve play 2000 . It 's year 2000 it 's time to get freakier , so I changed my score . All 19 songs are off the hook , there is not one song , that I can say I do n't enjoy . I 'm tired of the haters talking about how one day he talks about God and the next day it 's all about sex . Mr. Kelly said his self that he is not perfect . What indivdual can honestly say they do n't think or talk about sex on a daily basis . Thinking is the same as doing it , in God 's eyes , so we all are sinners . So haters stoping hating and go get TP2.com , -LRB- Platinum status -RRB- , and ask for forgiveness .
 I 'M A BIG FAN OF R. KELLY AND HIS MUSIC . THIS IS PROBABLY HIS BEST ALBUM . THERE ARE A LOT OF HATERS OUT THERE THAT JUST DO N'T KNOW HOW TALENTED THIS MAN REALLY IS . IN MY OPINION HE IS THE TIGHTEST R@B ARTIST IN THE MUSIC WORLD . TO MR. KELLY ... I 'VE WORN THIS CD OUT ALREADY , SO I 'M LOOKING FOWARD TO SEE WHAT YOU WILL COME OUT WITH NEXT . TO ALL OF THE FANS OUT THERE WHO LIKE GOOD , QUALITY , R@B MUSIC , THIS IS DEFINITELY A MUST BUY !!!!!!
 this Album deals with all issues involving Relationships & various struggles . R.kelly puts his Heart & soul on display & brings Soul to the Human Ear . `` I did n't Mean it , The Greatest Sex , I Do n't mean it , feelin on your Booty , I Wish , Fiesta , A Woman 's threat , the storm is over are all Great Songs . the Versatility of this Musical Genius is truly something else . he is truly a Very Gifted & Soulful brother . TP2 is like the Movie `` The Godfather part 2 '' a Classic of Epic depth & Balance.Great Album . thsi album has been the Spring board for all Modern Era R&B Albums.John Legend , Usher , Ginuwine , Anothny Hamilton , etc. . . got alot off this Album .
 This is simply the best R. Kelly . I do n't care what lot of people think of 12 Play but this one beats it with no competiton . Chocolate Factory is hot too , but does not strike it like this one does . My favorite songs are : Feelin ' On Yo BootyA Woman 's ThreatR & B ; ThugStrip For YouThis is a must have !!
 R. kelly has outdone his self once again . If you are a real freak then you will love this cd . The best songs are Greatest Sex , Strip for you and Fiesta but dont rule out I dont mean it , I mean i dont mean it , and Womans Threat . I admit that this albulm is alot like his last couple of albulms with the focus on sex but you know what your gon na get when you buy a r.kelly cd , so if you dont want candy dont go in the candy store . Just as a warning R.kelly had helped fathered alot of babies -LRB- including mine -RRB- so if your gon na listen to this cd with your man used protection !
 I 'm not a huge fan of R. Kelly . So I just have to say when he released this record I was n't the first person in line to buy it . Instead , I waited for singles to come out and see if i liked them . Well , before that happened my cousin recommend it to me . In all honesty i was surprised , this is a wonderful record . I loved every track but just a few . My favorites are
 This CD is on hit . Seldom do I find a CD that I don ; t have to fast forward to another song . I can listen to CD straight through . It has my `` Baby do it again '' songs , my `` Can you handle all this booty-liscious songs , and my `` Yea I remember that '' song . I love the CD . R.Kelly is up there man .
 If someone would ask me who is the best R&B artist of all times , R.Kelly will be my first choice . Not only his voice is smooth & emotional , he even writes , composes & produces all of his -LRB- wonderful -RRB- songs . This album is a great example for R.Kelly 's rare talent . The highlights of this album are `` The Storm Is Over '' , `` I Wish '' & all of the gospel flavored tracks . Through the great `` Fiesta '' , the unique & original `` R&B Thug '' & `` Do n't You Say No '' & the naughty `` Strip For You '' , `` The Greatest Sex '' & `` Feeling On Yo Booty '' it gets pretty obvious - R.Kelly is an unbelievable , talented , wise musical genius . No one will dare to argue about it .
 Two weeks ago I bought his R. album because I heard some of its singles and I thought it 'd be a great album . Finally , my intuition was right and his last album was great , but 30 songs are too many to be different between them . Last week I saw TP-2 . COM in a shelf and I decided to buy it thinking that it 'd be like R.But not , it 's more excellent than his last effort . All the songs have rythm , especially `` Like a freak -LRB- one of my favourites -RRB- , all the songs talked about different views of the love , and the song dedicated to his mom is da bomb . `` I wish '' is his greatest song since `` I believe I can fly '' . I do n't get it 5 stars because the theme of sex is very repetitive in the album . There are tones of themes apart from sex . But I think is the best album R. Kelly has done . Well done ...
 First of all I love this cd it has everything from tight beats to romantic songs . R. Kelly can do it all . With his hit single I Wish poppin off the charts r. kelly added more flava to this cd with great tracks like the greatest sex , and I wish . He has proven that he still has flava and I ca n't wait until he comes out with a new cd .
 Hello Everyone , I have listened to this cd and I wanted to share my opinion . I enjoyed it . Because everything he talks about is really happening . Like , for instance . The song I wish -LRB- to the homies that were lost -RRB- It 's talking about a guy thats was involved in gangs and stuff like that and he ended up dead . There are so many people that die every day because of stuff like that . It 's just nice that that someone finally decided to tell the truth about it . R Kelly did that . Well Thats my opinion . If you do n't like it than thats yours.But to anyone that enjoys Rap and R&B I would recomend this cd .
 I discovered R. Kelly with `` When a Woman 's Fed Up '' which is one of the tightest song I 've ever heard . TP2.com may be not the best from Mr. Kelly but I think it still diserves 5 stars . The music on the album is tigth along with the lyrics . Original concept bring that man to the top . When you listen to `` I do n't mean it '' , `` I wish '' , `` A woman 's treat '' , you can feel his pain . That is what a good artist made of . Only a few artists can do that . When you listen to Wyclef , 2Pac and R. Kelly , you can feel their pain , their joy in the lyrics and in the music . That makes R. Kelly , one of the greatest artists . The album `` R '' was his best and TP2.com is an excellent album .
 all i have to say is its R-kelly . its not gon na be bad
 This is mainly an r and b album like most of you probably have assumed , but their are some tunes that are hip-hoppy , you know what I 'm sayin ? Some great songs to check out
 THIS ALBUM HAS ONE OF THE BEST SINGLES OUT THERE TODAY.I GIVE R.KELLY ALOT OF CREDIT IN THIS ALBUM `` ALOT OF CREDIT . '' BUY THIS ALBUM NOW.YOU WO N'T REGRET IT .
 After the self-indulgent double-disc , R. , was released in 1998 , it became his best-selling album ever . Then , his 5th album , TP-2 . Com was released . This album is probably his best album ever . During this peroid , he changed very much . On the cover , -LSB- ... -RSB- He also has braids , instead of his bald-headed look . Do n't let the album cover fool you . It is still the original R. Kelly , singing bedroom ballads and even slow jams , like TP-1 -LRB- as known as 12 Play -RRB- . Oh yeah , did I mention that this is a sequel to his 1992 classic , 12 Play ? People call it The Play 2 or 12 Play 2000 . The memorial track , `` I Wish '' , is one of my favorite tracks on this album . He talks about the death of a friend and how he wishes he was in the world today . TP-2 . Com has some killer dance jams . `` Fiesta '' is a blazing hot dance jam , which employs many spanish guitars and hip-hop beats mixed together . Although , `` Fiesta '' is not one of my favorite songs on this album , it 's still a hot track . `` The Greatest Sex '' , `` I Do n't Mean It '' , `` Just Like That '' , `` A Woman 's Threat '' , and `` I Decided '' are sensual gems . All 5 of them are my favorites . TP-2 . Com is where R. Kelly is more matured and improved . He has put a lot of truth and soul into this album . `` Feeling On Yo Booty '' is another example of a stroke of genuis . It is also one of my favorites because it is a updated slow jam . It sounds like a remake of his classic , `` Bump and Grind '' . -LSB- ... -RSB- There are so many ballads on this album that I really enjoy . The track , `` Strip For You '' is a slow and sexy tune -LSB- ... -RSB- In my opinion , TP-2 . Com was the best album of 2000 . The double-disc , R. , is my favorite R. Kelly album , but I 'm starting to love TP-2 . Com . TP-2 is way better than 12 Play . This album was longer and more sensual than 12 Play also . Buy this and buy his double-disc opus , R. , which has a wide-range of artistic styles . TP-2 . Com is the best album R. Kelly has produced , arranged , and written ever . A 5-star masterpiece . A +

 R.Kelly is one of the most talented artist of the century . I 'm glad that his album is being released on this day , because today Nov 7 , we make a statement of unity of who we want in office and his album is hitting the scene letting us know who he is as an artist . Keep up the good work R. and keep on giving us something we can relate to and understand coming from a young , black man 's point of view.I can remember seeing you in the Cotton Club on Michigan Ave , but look at you now , you made it to the TOP . Do n't stop sharing the gift that God has given you and keep on doing what makes you happy.Sincerely , L
 The best R. Kelly cd ever . It very well may be my favorite CD of all time . Although I do n't like the cd cover .
 Normally i like to be alot more in depth with my reviews and really break down albums for you guys . But honestly , theres really not a whole lot to be said about this album besides its the best R&B ; album of the last 20 years , from the best R&B ; singer/producer/songwriter of the last 20 years , period . There really isnt words that can express how truly amazing this album is . Its in a league of its own . And the sad thing about it is , this album really gets looked over alot . It doesnt get nearly the credit it deserves . R. Kelly created a masterpiece with this album . This album is what helped make R. Kelly the legend he is today . He is our generations Marvin Gaye , but better . No offense to Marvin , because he is a legend as well , but even Marvin hasnt been able to accomplish half of what Kells has . And this album just shows how bright of a star Kells is . His star is blinding . But i still dont think he gets the credit he deserves . People shouldnt even be considering Usher better than R. Kelly . Ushers not even close . Usher is damn good , i love Usher . But no one comes close to R. Kelly . Say what you want about his private life , and his scandals , but he is untouchable in the music industry , plain and simple . And this album couldnt have been made by any other artist in the industry . TP2 is a front to back classic . Every song is good , so i dont think i can really say much about any songs in particular . I mean , if i had to absolutely pick one song that i like the best , it would be a toss up between the sugary sweet mellow accoustic laced `` All I Really Want '' , The ultimate love song that makes you wan na just fall madly in love `` Just Like That '' , and the really good mid tempo love song `` I Decided '' . And the other 16 tracks are all just as good . Just trust me , if you any sort of respect for the man or the genre , buy this album.Grade : UNTOUCHABLE -LRB- A + + + -RRB-
 Without a doubt R. Kelly is one of the most prolific male r & b ; artists who I agree with another poster is on the level of Marvin Gaye . Early on I noticed the similarities between the two in their music - the ability to sing truly moving songs that touched on spirituality while at the same time writing/producing & singing some of the most sensuous & sexually charged songs.I bought this cd initially for the standout track , I WISH - the song touched my heart and in my opinion is one of R 's greatest hit singles . I gave the disc 4.5 stars because at 19 tracks it is bloated and contains a few filler tracks that should 've been left off but it 's easy enough to skip over those.The songs that stay on repeat for me are
 This is absolutley the best r & b album . You have to admire R 's honesty in his lyrics . Lyrics such as `` when you leave up out my room , you 're gon na be wakin bowlegged '' . This is the best music to f % $ ! to . Love it !!
 R. Kelly 's 12 Play from 1993 was one of his best albums in the catalogue , the second version of it released in 2000 was n't as good as his albums flwless first album but it was good nonetheless . The both album 's main theme is sex and despite some non-sexual songs like `` I Wish '' and `` Storm Is Over '' this song is mostly about that subject . While it is n't as good as 12 Play it 's great compared to T-3 and an album to put on the purchase list.It all starts with `` Strip For You '' , a laid-back sexy song that suits R. Kelly perfect . `` R&B ; Thug '' is slicker and more uptempo , `` The Greatest Sex '' is fullfilling the album concept , but it 's not among the better songs of this album . `` I Do n't Mean It '' and `` Just Like That '' are both slow jams , the first one however is more romantic though . `` Just Like A Freak '' is another sex song , If you had n't understood that ? but this song feautures rap and latin influenced music and it 's unique to this album . `` Fiesta '' is also latin-influenced and on this album version Jay-Z does n't appear . `` Do n't You Say No '' yet another so-so slow jam . `` One Me '' is also a slow jam , I think this is one of the better . `` I Wish '' is defenitely the best , but ironically it 's not about sex at all , but about friends that died . A hit single and a very touching mid tempo song when R. Kelly shows his best side . `` A Woman 's Threat '' is a midtempo , and also single released I think . `` I Decided '' continues the sexy trend . `` I Mean -LRB- I Do n't Mean It -RRB- '' is a midtempo where he perform backround lyrics for himself . `` All I Really Want '' is great soul , but it sounds more like a song made for Tyrese then the usual R. Kelly song . `` Feeling On Ya Booty '' is surprisingly good , but dirty . The last song `` Storm Is Over '' is the second best , only after `` I Wish '' and neither a sex song , it reminds me of `` I Believe I Can Fly '' , a ballad that also feautures gospel choirs.So , what 's the verdict ? . A good album defenitely , You knew the dilemma already before you bouht it , so do n't expect this to be a `` R Kelly '' or `` R '' but surprisingly enough it features a few non sex single and they are actually some of the best on the entire album . It may feature a few too many songs -LRB- 17 if we count the remix of `` I Wish '' and some are not as good as others , but on the other hand the high points lift this album to great votes . Not one of his best , but not too far behind . If You 're New start with the eponymous `` R. Kelly '' or `` R '' .
 R.Kelly have prove to everybody that he is The World Greatest Male Musician , Artist , Singer , Performer , Producer , Songwriter , Arranger and Re-Mixer Of All Time . This Album Kick the A ** of all other R&B ; Albums of other Artists . You ca n`t compare perfection -LRB- R.Kelly -RRB- with imperfection -LRB- Rest of the so call R&B ; singers -RRB- . Every sigle song is sensational , emotional , sensual , heartfelt , soulful , etc. and etc. . Songs like
 How can I describe this Classic Album ? ... JUST SAYING THAT IS THE BEST HONEYMOON , BEDROOM R&B CD EVER MADE ... CAN MAKE TO R.KELLY MORE JUSTICE . On this Masterpiece You could find R.Kelly at his best
 Without question this is the best album that R.Kelly made so far.Like no other artist , he has a great talent and a enormous gift along with his great soulful voice , excellent writting skills and wonderful arranging of his songs.For me this is THE BEST R&B ; AND SOUL ALBUM EVER MAKE UNTIL NOW . I love all the tracks on this CD , EXCUSE ME , ON THIS SOLID GEM CD ! . But because its 19 tracks and almost 78 minutes long , my most heard songs are
 GREAT WORK FROM R.KELLY.IT BRINGS THE BEATS AND THE RYTHEM.THIS CD IS GREAT TO LISTEN TO WITH YOUR FRIENDS.ALSO IF YOUR AT A SCHOOL DANCE THEY SHOULD PLAY SOME OF R.KELLY 'S TRACKS.SOME OF THE BEST TRACKS ARE TP-2 , LIKE A REAL FREAK , FIESTA , I WISH , A WOMAN 'S THREAT , AND FEELIN ' ON YO BOOTY .

 TP-2 . COM IS AN EXCELLENT ALBUM AND HE IS THE MAN OF RNB IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY IN THE NEW MILLINEIUM AND FOREVER BUT THE ALBUM TP.2-COM IS ON ADVANCED AND VERY HIGH LEVEL THAN HIS PREVIOUS ALBUM AT HIS BEST WHILE MY FAVOURITE SONG ON THE ALBUM ARE I WISH , I WISH -LRB- REMIX -RRB- , R&B THUG , JUST LIKE THAT , LIKE A REAL FREAK , FIESTA , ONE ME AND WOMEN THREAT BUT ONE OF MY BEST SONG I LIKE ON THE ALBUM IS STORM IS OVER , THEN AND ANYBODY IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY CA N'T TOUCH HIM AT ALL AND BECAUSE HE IS TOO MUCH
 Simply all the songs that are on the album are flawless , relaxing , fresh and classic . You got to admit that R.Kelly is a genius when you talk about doing music . For me he is one of the best R&B ; Singers ever to live and he prove this on this Classic . From the very first song the Self title song
 This Cd is really good and long and all of the songs were worth puttin on dis album . You haters really got ta listen to him sing man . damn he is a really good lyricst . he knows what he 's sayin . buy and and love it chi love to the fullest
 WHAT CAN I SAY ??? `` TP-2 . COM '' IS THE BEST ALBUM EVER MADE BY A R&B ; SINGER . BUT R.KELLY IS MORE THAN A SINGER ... HE IS A LIVING LEGEND . HE IS WHAT MUSIC IS ABOUT . THE WHOLA ALBUM IS VERY PASSIONATE , BEAUTIFUL , RAW , INSPIRING AND DEEP AS HELL . ALL OF THE SONGS ARE MADD HOTT ... BUT THE BEST JOINTS ON IT ARE -LRB- NOT IN ORDER
 This is the best album that i have ever heard . its his best and the best overall album ever made . ever track is great
 It ` s simple as that . The Best that you can get . R.Kelly is Music Genius and no one should deny that.His voice is probably at his best here
 Really good cd . R.Kelly has done it again with the music and the good tracks . Most of the songs on here are really good , and you know a cd is good when the majority of the songs are tight instead of just 3 or 4 songs on a cd . Though this man is a pervert and nasty , you have to admit that he is talented and makes very good music . He does say some stuff that is rather graphic that I really do n't like , and is not a surprise given his little scandals , but still worth the buy . The best songs on here are `` just like that '' , `` like a real freak '' , `` I wish '' the original and remix is the best , feeling on your booty '' , and I think the other two songs before that . Another thing that I want to say is that you should NEVER pay $ 6 or more for this cd from someone from this site if it is USED ! In that case , you might as well buy it at the regular store for $ l2 from Circuit City if you are silly enough to pay that price for it . This site is all about good bargains , so why be silly enought to buy some USED cd close to regular price for a BRAND NEW one ?!!!!!!!! People think ! -LRB- Never buy from Target or Walmart or any of those wannabe name brand stores that sell stupid things for ridiculous , name brand prices . -RRB- Overrall , good cd .
 I will love you for life if you send me a copy . I do n't care if its a bootleg copy . LUV YATP2.com is in the house , it would be the only way i can sleep at night . Thank YouFallon and I 'm out .
 The seven sonatas for two violins might be the most imaginative and passionate works of the sort since the great Baroque string virtuoso Heinrich Biber , and though they are ` modern ' in affect , they are profoundly traditional in tonality . Like Biber 's stunning Mystery Sonatas , with their radical scordatura effects , these sonatas push the violinists to their technical limits and keep them there , but not merely for display , rather for emotional intensity.Have you ever gone to a performance of the Cirque de Soleil ? There you might see two strong acrobats doing hand-to-hand balancing tricks , and you might at first suppose that the repertoire of such tricks is exhausted , all done , nothing new . But then the acrobats uncork a trick that you ca n't imagine possible , that totally defines Newtonian laws . That 's how these sonatas will touch you.The romances and elegies for violin and piano that complete the CD are surprisingly luscious romanticism , almost as if Pettersson had decided to compose for intimate occasions . The single piece for solo piano is also daringly traditional , almost Ravel-like . Pianist Lennart Wallin plays quite well ; old amazon friends may take note of how my heart swells with Swedish national pride at this performance.I 'm always more a fan of chamber music on CD than of symphonies , and Pettersson is primarily a composer of symphonies , but I think this intimate performance , full of variety and fire , might well be the optimum intoduction to Pettersson 's musical idiom .
 Exceptional album of an experienced band combining powerful rock with prog & psycho , near to `` King Crimson '' , `` Procol Harum '' etc. . Foot-stomping anthems , guitar riffs , organ-driven psychedelic ballads - it 's there . `` Ancient Grease '' are not unknowns - they started their life as a Welsh R&B band `` Eyes of Blue '' which had a couple of successful albums and as vocalist had Gary Pickford - Hopkins -LRB- later `` Wild Turkey '' and THE VOICE on Rick Wakeman 's `` Journey to the Earth '' -RRB- . `` Eyes of Blue '' became `` Strawberry Dust '' and , finally , `` Ancient Grease '' -LRB- when they got signed by Mercury -RRB- . The album did n't get enough support from brainless execs of the label - usual story - although it had a huge potential . The reminders of the band emerged in 77 as `` Racing Cars '' and even made it into British charts , but I am impressed with that one , from 1970 . Re-released by `` Angel Air '' which has a motto `` Where The Artist Has A Voice '' - how very true ! The voice of `` Ancient Grease '' got second breath with this CD
 This is one of the best hard rock albums I 've ever heard . Ancient Grease plays like there is no tomorrow and sounds like Led Zeppelin without inhibitions circa 1970 . The lead guitarist , Graham Williams , sounds like Jimmy Page on overdrive . The lead singer , Graham Mortimer -LRB- Morty -RRB- is excellent and later was the main man in the group Racing Cars . On Freedom Train , Morty at the end of the song , does the best Paul McCartney imitation I ever heard . Buy this .
 Band 's sole album , originally came out in 1970 . This four piece , coming from Welsh , UK may just be another one of those ` better ' 70 's lp 's that you 've never heard ' . Tracks that -LRB- sort of -RRB- threw me for a loop were `` Freedom Train '' , the foot-stomping `` Do n't Wait '' , the semi-Zeppelin like `` Eagle Song '' , the well-played acoustic `` Time To Die '' and the title cut `` Women And Children First '' .

 Chang is an expressive cellist . When her touch is light , the sound becomes lyrical and even dainty , until she must convey drama , and this she can do with a brilliance and delicacy that I have not heard in recent cellists . Then again , when called upon to be intense , she performs with a fluidity so that the cello sounds like an extension of herself . I 'm listening to her Respighi as I write , and not only is the sound on this DVD lovely , but Chang brings the perfect combination of musical exploration , precision , and interpretation . The tunes are a good mix . A few are standards to any cellists repertoire , but these are worth hearing in Chang 's hands . She brings a beautiful sound to them that is mature and ... I do n't know how better to put it than that these sound like `` love '' . Love of music , love of her instrument . I have not heard any other cellist so devoted , and at the same time with such a high quality that what is typical becomes transformed . The Kim/Panufnik is stunning . Rachmaninov 's Vocalise has a restrained passion that is intriguing at the same time that it takes you drifting off into daydreams . And the title piece , Saint-Saens ' The Swan , is majestic . Slatkin conducts the Philharmonia so that the orchestra alternates between the perfect background for display of the cellist and the perfect lead as all the instruments swell . This is a beautiful album , one that you may find yourself listening to repeatedly -LRB- as I have -RRB- to pick up each nuance and feel for yourself each emotion Chang conveys . She is truly a superb cellist .
 How has so much of this incredibly beautiful music escaped my attention for so long ? I knew the Saint-Saens and the Rachmaninov and one of the Faure pieces , but the rest were totally unfamiliar . On this disc , Han-Na Chang brings this rarely heard music out into the light of day , and renders both the unfamiliar and the familiar with superb tone coloring and deeply felt interpretations.This is simply the most beautiful and moving cello playing I have ever heard . It 's going to spend a lot of time in my CD player .
 Like Sarah on violin , Han-na Chang is a young virtuoso on cello . Although they are not related , both are young and bring a passion to their playing that is hard to beat . `` The Swan '' is a beautiful collection of classical pieces -LRB- longest is 13 minutes -RRB- from a smorgasbord of composers . Leonard Slatkin and the Philharmonia Orchestra are superb and provide a wonderful landscape of sound where Han-na glides in and out of with grace and style . This is a wonderful CD .
 I bought this CD a year ago and still listen to it pretty often . Han-na is able to deliver her sensitive interpretation of the pieces because she has the matching skills . The phrasing and the dynamics throughout the performance is really quite impressive and each piece comes off beautifully . Almost half of the pieces are adpated or arranged for solo cello and the orchestra background , and though I usually have a suspicious attitude towards such stuffs , Han-na 's pieces can almost pass . The listeners will almost believe the pieces were actually arranged for such combination -LRB- i.e.she 's good -RRB- . A few flaws
 I have been a fan of Han-Na Chang since her debut disc came out 5 years ago . Since then I have followed her career intently . I have n't been disappointed so far . She is a cellist of great sensitivity , and no less fire ! If her first two discs were previews of things to come , this disc represents full maturity that is evident in Chang 's playing . On first sight , this may look like a well-marketed , but just another encores CD . I also thought at first , ` why devote a whole disc to short encores ? Surely she could have done something more substantial ' . When I listened to it , my doubts vanished completely . Each note she plays , she plays with utter dedication . She really seems to love the music , and instead of just showing off her technique , she finds deep meaning of every piece , even the over-played ` The Swan ' . My favourite pieces on the disc are Sicilienne by Faur&eacute; , Glazunov 's Chant du m&eacute;nestrel , Respighi 's seldom heard Andante con variazioni , and Dvorak 's Klid . But all the pieces here , chosen by Han-Na herself , are wonderful . She plays WITH the orchestra , answering them or making a statement to which then the orchestra gives a response . I have seldom heard the Phlharmonia Orchestra so inspired . No doubt Han-Na had something to do with it . Also , Leonard Slatkin conducts with sensitivity , and the sound is first class EMI sound.Incidentally , this recording , rare for a recital disc of this genre , has been received with great enthusiasm from two of the world 's fussiest classical review magazines
 I fell in love with Chang , Ha-Na 's playing , upon hearing her at a concert in Seoul , a few years back . I was rather lucky to be passing through and stopped at the Opera house to listen to what my friend had told me was the most eloquent and beautiful classical artist hailing from the Republic of Korea . In this album she has not only played the pieces well , but also she has matured her sound to a point that rivals many of her contemporary peers . A worth while buy at any price .
 Very beautiful , moving and soothing . Relaxing and nurturing . I like it b/c she brings humble and quiet serenity rather than trying to boast technical skills -LRB- which is considerable by the way -RRB- .
 If you 're not already a fan of Dave Evans , you will be after listening to this powerful CD . Dave 's writing is excellent , his guitar and banjo work is outstanding , but it 's his gritty , soulful singing that is so outstanding . Whether he 's doing an old Carter Family song like `` Hello Stranger '' , one of the several tunes he wrote for the album like the title tune or the mournful `` C.O. Come And Get Me '' , or his original adaptation of Tom T Hall 's `` Last Public Hanging In West Virginia '' , his powerful singing really puts the song over in a truly unique way . This is a highly recommended album .
 I love all Dave Evans music , but this is the best yet ... Dave has the most unique voice in bluegrass , I wish everyone would give a listen to him , they would be hooked for life like me .
 WHAT A ALBUM EVERYONE SHOULD GO OUT AND GET THIS ONE IF YOUR ALREADY AFAN OR YOU SHOULD BECOME ONE WHAT A VOICE GREAT SOULFUL SINGING & PLAYING HIS VOICE IS SO POWERFUL HE FEELS HIS MUSIC TAKE NOTE BLUEGRASS FANS GET READY FOR FOR A FANTASTIC ALBUM DAVES BEST EFFORT TO DATE SHOULD GET PLENTY OF RADIO AIRPLAY
 This CD is fantastic ! John 's poetry speaks to the human experience . Several phrases really `` struck a chord '' with me . In addition to the thought-provoking poetry , the music is awesome . The intricate rhythms develop and change with each song . John uses several culturally diverse instruments to create a sound that is truly a feast for the ears . `` Drum Poetry '' offers music to dance or do yoga to , or to simply `` chill out '' to . It is definitely a CD worth adding to your music collection .
 I have been using this cd for my yoga classes for five months now and my student 's love it ! Each track offers a unique inspiration and rhthym that keeps the practiced alive . `` Stars '' is my favorite meditation/savasana track ! If you 're looking for a rockin ' drumming cd for yoga ~ look no furher . This is it ! A gift to all yogi 's and yogini 's .
 I 've been driving around with this CD , This Rhythm Is Not Mine , in my car for months now and I listen to it whenever I want to cheer up or just mellow out . I 'm surprised that I never get tired of it - to me this is a sign of how good it is and how diverse . The CD is made up of drumming and poetry for the first half and then instrumental for the second half and it 's all great ! The drumming is amazing and very compelling and I love the poetry . John de Kadt 's poetry is sweet and simple and the more I 've listened , the more depth I find in it . His poetry speaks to life in a cosmic sense and his songs are filled with how ancient , full and fragile our existence is . -LRB- His voice is a great blend with the drums - soft and a little sexy ! -RRB- The whole second half of the CD is instrumental and it 's just fantastic drumming ! There is so much texture to what he does with his instruments and you 're completely pulled into the rhythm . It 's great for dancing , yoga or just to go deeper to any moment .
 John de Kadt 's album `` This rhytm is n't mine '' is an experience that you do n't want to miss ! He took me to a wondeful journey I did not expect - journey through lifetimes and worlds , my heart beating with his drumms , the body and mind awakenning to a new level consciousness . His voice is soothing and electrifying at the same time , his lyrics touching the soul with love and understanding , the rhytm shaking my roots , reminding me to live , breath , be aware ... What a joy ! This will remain my favourite CD for years ! Thanks , John ... Tereza
 Surprisingly addictive music created by this man with only percussion instruments . At first I thought that the spoken accompaniment would ruin the drums . His pacing , his timing , his words , all complement the drumming , and make for a relaxing and soothing album . It catches your attention , lets it go , catches you again .
 This rhythm may not be his nor mine , but this CD is mine . And I 've purchased several other copies for gifts.As beautiful and moving as John 's poetry is , I also appreciate being able to listen to the clean simplicity as well as the interwoven complexity of the rhythms , the sounds , the vibrations of breath and of beating that the instrumental versions provide . With these , there are no words to cover and confuse with their meanings and messages . There is only the music ... and me . Yet there is so much more ... There is a practice , a way of working with sounds ; sacred sounds ; old sounds . The sounds are intoned , over and over again , while feeling the vibrations in the body ; in the chest ; in the heart . Then the voice becomes quiet , while the word-form representing these sounds is breathed , in and out , in and out . Finally , all these forms are let go , and one sits quietly while the impressions of the practice flow through one 's consciousness , as awareness is allowed to more fully open and expand to embrace whatever messages might come to one , riding on the breath and the heartbeat.This album can be very effectively used in a similar manner . Listen to the version of one of these pieces including the lyrics . Listen to the instrumental version of the same piece . Sit in silence and listen with your inner ears , with the ears of your heart . There are Messages beyond the messages ; these Messages are waiting to be heard . In the Tao , it is said that the truth that can be spoken is not the Truth . It has also been taught that the Truth can only be found in the silence between the sounds , between and beyond the words ... if you are open to It.This album can help you find an opening ; perhaps many openings . Do n't be afraid . Buy it . Listen with your outer ears and with your inner ears . Listen with your heart.Thank you , John de Kadt , for allowing yourself to be played as you are by the Player 's Hands .
 While many other frame drummers have been touted as the finest of our time , no one can compare to John de Kadt . His drumming is technically excellent and his style is mesmerising . Add to this the `` beat poetry '' at which John is also a virtuoso and you have a magnificent CD . If you 're not into the poetry thing , he 's done you the favor of including instrumental only -LRB- no poetry -RRB- versions of the poetry pieces.I have also heard de Kadt play and recite in person . I 'm glad to say that he is even more impressive live . He really can play the frame drum AND tell his poetry at the same time . Awesome .
 John de Kadt plays and speaks with great artistry , with a variety of world instruments and with an appreciation of natural rhythms in the world .
 I first heard this CD at the Kripalu Center for Yoga and Wellness . You ca n't help but move your body to this CD . Most of the CD is spoken word , which I 'm not entirely crazy about , but the overall feel is so visceral that I do n't care if the poetry is rather eh . The background drumming and various instruments are all so perfectly interwoven . If you can '' t move your body to this CD you 'd better look into yourself !
 This was Eider 's first -LRB- and to date , only -RRB- solo record after leaving the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy , and it 's hard to imagine a more sly and sophisticated debut . Shuffling through styles , Eider invests every one of these songs with his trademark wry world view . Standout tracks include
 My rating for this 1992 album is 4 stars but to balance the ridicolous review written by the guy before I have to put 5 . If you do n't understand the essence of rock 'n' roll , why do you write a review for a rock 'n' roll album ? R 'n' R is about show , excess , machism , look , being `` larger than life '' , long hair , slim fit dresses , leather , bikes ... If you re a diligent school boy or computer geek you do n't play rock 'n' roll and do n't look like a rockstar . Anyway , my rating for this album is 4 . But let 's begin with a little bit of history . This album is essentially a Steve Stevens album such was Atomic Playboys his first and best solo outcome . In that project the singer involved was Parramore McCarty of Warrior fame -LRB- `` Fighting for the Earth '' -RRB- a very good choice , he was a metal singer in the end . Stevens seemed to search for a new singer to be associated with for this album , maybe because he thought that a famous singer with voice , attitude and image could make the album have a bigger impact on the market -LRB- like his Stevens / Billy Idol collaboration -RRB- . This time he found the partner in Michael Monroe ex Hanoii Rocks . He 's not a metal singer , he 's more a rock singer , a street rock singer and more than anything else he was n't probably totally on the same page with Stevens musically . The albums the two had in mind were probably very different . Monroe was thinking about a street album , Stevens an hair metal , guitar pyrotechnics based one . Luckily in the end the Stevens approach prevailed , mainly because he was the author of the music . Unfortunatly though , a little influence by Monroe is audible so the album fail to be straight and pure hair metal such as Atomic Playboys was -LRB- even with the different influences Stevens put on the table -RRB- . Monroe is not that singer . His vocal extension is very limited , he sings like a sort of bad Jagger copy , without his personality of course . Parramore McCarty for instance could have worked much better . All the album is very adrenalinic , pumped up and full of guitar excesses like any hair metal albums should be and there are some very good songs . `` 100 proof love '' , `` Lethal underground '' , `` Got ta get a hold '' , `` R 'n' R Degeneration '' for istance are very good songs with the right amount of energy , melody and hipness to be hair hits . `` The world is watching '' is the power ballad of the album , there always need to be one in a 90 's metal album . It 's a beautiful song , not romantic and too sweet ... it is an interesting song . Here and there a couple of fillers appear , `` Dead man '' for instance does n't mean that much , the arrangement is too full and there 's not a clear melodic idea to support the song . `` Teenage nervous breakdown '' is a `` traditional blues '' -LRB- I , IV , V chords -RRB- pumped up , but really nothing special , I do n't know if Monroe is responsible for this choice or if Stevens decided to give Monroe something to let him feel more comfortable . A weak tune , even if Stevens guitar work is stellar as always . Having said that the singer is nothing special , that a couple of songs are filler , I have to say that Stevens guitar work is brilliant and the production is great , the album sounds very very good , with the right amalgama between the instruments . And Stevens played extremely well from a guitarist point of view , as rhythmn player and as a soloist . Three or four riffs are strong and powerful . Brilliant ! It was his time , he was playing really great . I like the whole sound of the album very much too . Compared to the Vince Neil album `` Exposed '' played and producted by Stevens too , I prefer this one . I 'd like to end with a comment on the bonus tracks . My edition , which is japanese has only the two `` demos '' of `` R 'n' R degeneration '' and `` Teenage nervous breakdown '' but lacks `` Scum lives on '' . The two demos are absolutely nothing special or particularly interesting . It was a bad choice to release these two as bonuses instead of 2 true new songs . The third song , I checked it on youtube `` Scum lives on '' is another filler one , really nothing particularly appealing , rightly taken out of the final list . In the end an album with lights and shadows . Fantastic guitar work by Stevens , very good production , some good songs , a singer which added nothing but detracted something to the work , some filler songs , forgettable bonuses tracks . You know what happened in those years . Grunge appeared on the scene and some very intelligent music executive thought it was the next big thing and started investing on that garbage let many valuable metal music projects die overnight . To support three chords horrible bands !!! Gosh . Considering that works by Stevens are few , I suggest the purchase of the album to people interested in his playing . But not at the stellar prices requested on the used market -LRB- near 200 dollars now -RRB- . Search for a copy at a right price . Check the music on Youtube anyway , almost the entire album is available there .
 Awesome tunes performed by great musicians Michael Brecker , Peter Erskine , Eddie Gomez , Don Grolnick and Mike Mainieri . A must have CD for any jazz music lover .
 If you 're looking for the definitive West Coast Cool instrumental and vocal sound of the 1950 's , go no further . This is it . The Gene Puerling vocal arrangements , mixed with Marty Paitch 's instrumental arrangements define , while perfectly complementing one another , the idiom you seek . The Hi Lo 's had a reputation for not missing a note of Puerling 's sometimes complex voicings . Listen to this album , and you 'll hear why . They are flawless . Paitch 's choice of musicians , and notes , is a study in correct . They came to the date to create a classic , and that 's what they did.TONY HOROWITZ
 I had this in LP form as a kid , and man , did it swing . What a great , great record . Too bad it 's unavailable , because I 'd love to hear it again . The Hi-Los are backed here by the incomparable Marty Paich Dek-Tette , who provide the perfect accompaniments . If memory serves me , the tunes include some well-known stuff like Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser 's `` Small Fry , '' the Gershwins ' `` Fascinatin ' Rhythm , '' and `` Something 's Comin ' '' from West Side Story , as well as lesser known gems such as `` Love Locked Out , '' `` Then I 'll Be Tired of You '' and `` Moon-Faced , Starry-Eyed , '' a wonderfully catchy tune by Kurt Weill and Langston Hughes from the 1940 's musical , Street Scene . The Hi-Los were unique for their impeccable vocal skills both individually and as an ensemble , and for the interesting way they arranged their music . The modern male harmony group Take Six owes a huge debt to the Hi-Los . I 'm a big fan of Take Six , and my appreciation of them grows straight out of having heard and loved the Hi-Los first . Note to whoever is holding the rights to this album
 You can enjoy this music even if you ca n't dance . It is fabulous .
 This is the perfect recording for anyone who already loves the vocal music of J.S. Bach or for anyone who feels that Bach 's music is too mathematical and non-emotional . Ian Bostridge is , arguably , the most emotional of all `` serious '' singers today . He interprets everything he performs and brings his own insights to his performances , whether , for example , the music be written by Bach or another of the singer 's obvious favorites , Benjamin Britten . The music on this album , usually sung by bass or soprano , sounds very right for tenor , esp . for Bostridge 's light , almost unearthly , sound . He is beautifully accompanied by an ensemble called Europa Galante which also plays three of Bach 's sinfonias for orchestra , without voice . This is a stunning album which I highly recommend .
 This CD is stunning . I am a cellist , and I originally bought it for some of the Bach pieces that featured prominent instrumental parts , but from the start , I was spellbound . The first selection , BWV 82A , is one of the most beautiful works of Bach that I have ever heard . Ian Bostridge 's voice is spellbinding . I am looking forward to hearing much more , especially his lieder CDs .
 There is a very interesting and thoughtful essay accompanying this disc , by Michel Roubinet and quite superbly translated into genuine English by Hugh Graham . In it the author draws attention to some aspects of the pietist tradition of Lutheranism , in particular its strong emphasis on the worshipper as an individual , and even more particularly the recurring theme of death as the gateway to each individual 's final fulfilment . This was the spirit of much of the poetry that Bach set in his cantatas , and it must have been to a great extent the particular strain of belief that underlay the transcendental musical inspiration of Bach himself . Bach knew love and he knew grief and he believed both to be God 's dispensation . He knew his own talent , he believed that to be God 's gift , and he worked to perfect it with an industry that would have been astonishing in someone who had far more perfecting to do . The spirit of his music is introspective , but it seems to me completely untouched by guilt or fear . Bach 's talent , unlike Milton 's , was not death to hide because for him death held no terrors.A review of this recital in a Sunday newspaper was phrased in such extravagant terms of praise that I noted it as something to acquire . I am relieved to calculate that this review can only have been five years ago , so long does it seem that I have been failing to do anything about it , but the name of Ian Bostridge registered firmly with me , and I now own the disc with a good idea , obtained in the intervening period , of why the original reviewer was so impressed . Bostridge is not only highly accomplished , he has an exceptional voice in the first place . It is what I think of as a ` true ' tenor , as opposed to the ` mezzo-tenor ' timbre of Schreier or Padmore . In spite of this Bostridge has a quite remarkable low register , something that he needs frequently in Bach and nowhere more on this disc than in Ich Habe Genug , where he adapts the soprano version and shows his self-assurance by leading off with it . There is more than an hour 's music here , it is all music of much the same type , but between composer and interpreters the experience was over in no time . Bostridge seems to me to hit the right expression in every piece without exception , and he is admirably offset by the Europa Galante group , not just the instrumentalists but also the three singers who perform the final chorale in Ich Armer Mensch.In addition to the arias , recitatives and the one chorus , there are three short instrumental numbers , the disc being rounded off with a sinfonia from the Peasant Cantata , providing an unexpected and pleasant contrast to the unrelieved devoutness of the rest of it . The recorded tone is admirable , and the liner-note is of real value . Apart from anything else , the translation by Hugh Graham puts his fellow practitioners to shame . If you read the note in English without realising it is a translation , as I did , you would never know , or at least I never suspected.I suppose it is slightly unusual for a young artist to introduce himself with an exhibition disc consisting entirely of music that is not only great but deeply serious and even solemn as well . However one of the most extraordinary things about Bach is just how strong his appeal has always been and always looks like being . The technical difficulty of his music that once seemed formidable seems so no longer , and in some ways he is easier to interpret successfully than most composers of similar stature . That does not detract in the slightest from what Bostridge has achieved here , and I would suggest that admirers of both great music and great singing would do well to be less dilatory about obtaining this disc than I was .
 I have cherished this recording for a long time , but never reviewed it , perhaps because the previous reviews are excellent . Yet this is the recording through which I discovered the artistry of Ian Bostridge . Artistry really is the word as it is never just the voice as exquisite as it is ; it is always also , and crucially , his interpretation . I too was spellbound immediately , I too found the music achingly beautiful , and I too heard a longing reminiscent of love songs . Several years and many Bostridge albums later , it is still one of my favourites . There is an inexplicable intimacy as well as universalism to this music . It is an album to which I find myself returning in all seasons , in all moods , finding it always fresh and mesmerizing .
 BOSTRIDGE COMMUNICATES BACH WITH ESPECIAL JOY!In the booklet insert with this disc , Michel Roubinet emphasizes Bach 's theme of death in the cantatas , which is a natural subject for religious and liturgical works , stressing as they do man 's continued struggle with mortal existence and his possible ultimate salvation in the afterlife . But Bach 's music is anything but morbid or depressing . The ten cantatas , excerpts , and arias sung on this disc by Bostridge are filled with hope and reassurance and BOSTRIDGE COMMUNICATES !! Bostridge 's unique sound is perfect for this Bach program , for the timbre is ethereal and conveys a hollow distance that identifies less with the character and more with the spirit of the subject . His singing captures the ` disembodied ' presence . Roubinet clearly expresses this in the liner notes , stating the fact that these cantatas picture the mortal somewhere between resignation to the world and the ultimate union with Christ - the theme that links every selection herein.In contrast to the bass voice , which is frequently associated with flesh-and-blood characters such as Jesus and Peter , the tenor in Bach is often a disembodied prescence . To this supple , even-toned voice are entrusted the arias which may be properly called , poetic and rhetorical illustrations with the purpose of making evident , and so to speak palpable , this or that aspect of faith or of the life of the believer . The tenor voice becomes that of the repentant sinner , and thus of hope.Beginning the recording with the Cantata `` Ich habe genug '' -LRB- It is enough . -RRB- was very clever programming because after hearing it , the listener has to keep listening ; it is so mesmerizing . Ian 's voice combined with the lovely and lush tone of the flute is almost hypnotic . Biondi 's skillful violin playing is exciting as shown in the Aria : `` Enbarme dich!Lass die Tranen '' -LRB- Have mercy on me -RRB- ; and also in the `` SinfoniaBWV212 '' . On this disc there are ten cantatas , excerpts and arias listed in the line-up information.Bostridge is ably accompanied by ` Europa Galante ' led by Fabio Biondi . Although Biondi has been criticized for his excessive zeal and breakneck tempos , but here he provides the kind of Bach with whom we are familiar , set to a mostly relaxed pace yet still enthusiastic.And , moreover , he keeps his instrumental forces well out of the way of the solo singer.This was recorded in a chapel in Parma , Italy , in March of 2000 . The audio has the distinction of sounding big , open , and reverberant in a natural way , with no distortion of vocal or instrumental color . A great addition for the ` Bach-a-holic ' -LRB- that 's me ! -RRB- . Liner notes and full text included .
 This is an impressive DVD , both instrumentally and vocally . I 'm no authority on voices but Bostridge 's seems excellent and well-matched to the material . I note the Amazon reviews were very positive , except for one dour fellow who complained that Bostridge 's voice was n't suited to Baroque music . However , he does n't say why . And who today knows exactly what a Baroque tenor would have sounded like ? Not to mention that some Baroque pieces were for castrati who certainly do n't exist in the modern world . It 's been said that back in the Baroque era 70 percent of all opera singers were castrati . So I guess it could be said that back then everyone was going nuts for the castrati , who no longer had them . : - -RRB- In any case , however , Bostridge sounds just fine to me . I do note that in Ich habe genug the flute is used instead of the oboe , and of course as an oboist I would have preferred the oboe . But no big deal . : - -RRB- As it turned out , the flute player 's period instrument has just about the worst intonation of all the woodwinds in the group , including at least two or three notes that were too bright almost to the point of being out of control . The oboe 's was much better and Baroque oboes ' intonation often left a lot to be desired.Overall , this seems a good selection of Bach cantatas and arias , which , until the advent of various period music groups , such as Europa Galante on this DVD , always seemed to be neglected.These pieces often being very short -LRB- I note a couple of them are called Sinfonia although only a couple of minutes in length -RRB- , that fact has an odd effect on Baroque compositions , including Bach 's , which often filled up pages of material with much formal argumentation in order to preserve symmetry . So with such short pieces the composer could `` let it all hang out '' to some extent and not worry so much about formal structural requirements , resulting in some of their most lyrical pieces , although there is certainly some formal fugue material here . But it 's less rigid and formal than one sees in the big works which are so famous.I always think of Baroque fugues when I walk down the main aisle of a Gothic Church . The super-imposed rhythms of arches for the main aisle , clerestory and gallery -LRB- the second and third stories -RRB- of a Gothic church have much in common with Baroque counterpoint . There 's a reason why music and architecture have been said to be the most similar of all the arts .
 Ca n't get enough of this recording!This combined genius of composer , instrumentalists and singer will grab your heart and soul and not let go until the last note has rung out.I have many Europa Galante CDs and this is my newest favorite one , no doubt.Bach , Biondi and his orchestra are a perfect match.Add Ian Bostridge to the mix and start to weep ... This is so beautifully interpreted and recorded , it stays in your ears and mind forever and you will go back listening to it many times and again.The musicians and sound engineers on this CD truly capture Bach 's unique ways of expressing himself through his amazing musical insights and genius.I grew up in Austria and to be able to understand the words and their meaning together with the music leans heavily on my soul.J.S.Bach 's love and devotion to his lord is truly apparent with these compositions and it wrenches my heart to be made aware yet again that this man once produced such strong emotions through his art , belief and awareness in something bigger than him.There is a video clip of this recording session on Youtube .
 This is the first time I leave a review in Amazon . I got this CD a few days ago and ever since I 've been listening every day and whole day . This CD brought me a great Joy of discovering another Bach , a well never run dry . Ian 's voice is sublime . I thought his voice is a bit soft in the beginning but with time I appreciate the deapth , texture and power in it more and more . I get never bored with this . Great work !
 Bruckner &egrave; sempre stato il compositore che mi affascinava di pi&ugrave; sebbenefino a poco tempo f&agrave; avessi sentito solamente la nona sinfonia all ` interno di una raccolta della Reference Recordings . Ho successivamente comprato la nona appunto -LRB- RR -RRB- e la sesta che ho trovato ad un prezzo stracciato -LRB- Edizioni Telarc diretta da Jesus Lopez-Cobos -RRB- . Se la nona della RR &egrave; veramente superba sia dal punto di vista dell ` esecuzione che dell ` incisione la sesta della Telarc &egrave; sicuramente superiore in quanto dinamica rispetto l'incisione che stiamo analizzando della EMI ma la qualit&agrave; della ripresa e l'esecuzione sono assolutamente sotto tono!Devo riconfermare ci&ograve; che ho letto pi&ugrave; volte su Eugin Jochum e la sua maestria nel riprodurre il messaggio musicale di Bruckner.Sono rimasto veramente stupito dalla qualit&agrave; generale dell ` incisione EMI anche considerando il prezzo a dire poco incredibile , in Italia penso sia impossibile trovare un cofanetto di nove sinfonie di questo valore musicale ed artistico ad un simile prezzo . Assolutamente consigliatissimo !
 The reason that this is the best complete symphony recordings of Bruckner is that conductor Eugene Jochum had a close relationship with Bruckner himself and knew the music like the palm of his hand . despite any negative commentary or the fact the preferred editions are conducted by the eminent Herbert Von Karajan , this box set is by far the best . All the symphonie sound great , polished , romantic , idealized , spiritual , energetic , passionate and mysterious , especially the opening movement of the final 9th , which comes in both versions here . This is a true winner for a recording box set . Your other choice should be Karajan though . But Jochum masters the music with great affinity and brilliant technical musicianship . In this recording , particularly impressive are the 7-9th . The early symphonies are German-Romantic Wagner/Mahler style but entirely Bruckner 's individualized style . It is music that is heavy , and not music for a beginner to hear . It is deep , highly emotional , music to meditate by . It 's slow-moving , dream-like and powerful , horns and brasses sounding fatalistic at times , while the winds and strings evoking either intensity or quietness . Bruckner himself would love this set . He certainly approved of Jochum conducting .
 This set is a wonderful bargain , preserving the second of Jochum 's integral recordings of the Bruckner symphonies . On Lp these performances , recorded in Dresden 's Lukaskirche in the 1970s , sounded a little diffuse when compared with the Bruckner Jochum recorded for DGG in the '50s and '60s . Digital remastering has brought admirable focus to the EMI analog masters and these recordings now sound as good or better than their DGG counterparts . The performances are quite similar , except that the Dresden Staatskapelle plays with a warmth and tonal lustre that is superior to the Berlin and Munich orchestras featured in the DGG set.In all cases , Jochum is the conductor for those people who enjoy the Schubert in Bruckner
 I recently reviewed the EMI `` soft box '' reissue of Jochum 's Dresden recordings of the nine Bruckner symphonies as a first rate bargain , and here 's another ! Tintner was a superb Bruckner conductor , trained -LRB- by Felix Weingartner -RRB- in Vienna in the 1930s . After fleeing the Nazis , Tintner took up various conducting assignments in Australia and New Zealand , opting out of a more glamorous career in the major international music centers . He eventually ended up in Canada where he died in 1999 , well-respected if relatively unknown -LRB- but with a growing reputation as a Bruckner interpreter -RRB- . Naxos had the brilliant idea of commissioning him to record their Bruckner cycle and the results are very impressive.Tintner 's performances are completely idiomatic and convincing , but what really sets this recording apart are his choices about what versions of the symphonies to perform . Bruckner 's symphonies exist in multiple versions made by the composer himself . In addition , these versions appear in different editions prepared by various editors , the most prominent being Robert Haas and Leopold Nowak . The first thing a conductor who performs Bruckner must do is choose among versions and editions . Yes , it 's very complicated ! So , when considering whether to buy this wonderful set , think about these three factors . First , whereas Eugen Jochum , for example , recorded the standard nine symphonies in the Nowak editions , Tintner also gives us the early symphonies -LRB- nos . `` 0 '' and `` 00 '' -RRB- making a total of 11 completely authentic Bruckner symphonies . -LRB- Although clearly early works , symphonies `` 0 '' and `` 00 '' are substantial and enjoyable compositions that should be heard . -RRB- Second , and again unlike Jochum , Tintner regularly performs the Haas editions rather than Nowak.Third , and most important , instead of recording what have become the standard Bruckner versions of symphonies 2 , 3 , and 8 , Tintner went back to Bruckner 's earliest versions -LSB- II/1872 , ed . Carragan ; III/1873 , ed . Nowak ; and VIII/1888 -89 , ed . Nowak -RSB- . These versions are substantially different from the versions most conductors play -LRB- II/1876 ; III/1877 or 1889 ; VIII/1890 -RRB- . My personal opinion ? I ca n't say I prefer Tintner 's choices over other versions , but I do n't need to exclude one or the other . Tintner is a very persuasive advocate for the earlier -LRB- and significantly more expansive -RRB- versions and I would n't want to be without his recordings . Moreover , Naxos provides generally excellent digital engineering for the three orchestras that perform in this fascinating set . -LRB- The lion 's share of performances come from the excellent Royal Scottish National Orchestra . -RRB- All of this thought-provoking excellence is presented in a slim and elegant , white `` soft box '' format which includes a substantial booklet with full notes -LRB- by the conductor -RRB- . To sum up , this set is more a complement than a rival to other versions . But it need fear competition from no other set , and the performances of the more famous Bruckner symphonies -LRB- 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 & 9 , all performed in the standard versions -RRB- are among the best currently available . If you need any other reason to buy this magnificent recording , just look at the price !
 I bought this set mainly out of curiosity . I had become familiar with the first versions of the Third and Eighth Symphonies in the Inbal renditions , but had never heard those of the First and Second . Well , from the very first hearing , I was dumbstruck by this set . Not only do Tintner 's versions of the Third and Eighth surpass Inbal 's in spaciousness and tension , but the other symphonies at the very least equal the very best competing performances ; Tintner 's Ninth is the only modern version that in my estimation equals the classic Furtwaengler recording.I have seen some reviewers disparage the first version of the Eighth Symphony . I do not understand this at all . To me , this very first version of the Symphony is far more dramatic and turbulent than the rather smoothed out revision , even in the Haas score -LRB- the Nowak is a failure , as far as I 'm concerned , in endorsing the cuts in the Adagio and Finale that ruin Bruckner 's superb transitions -RRB- . Bruckner 's origingal thoughts in almost all cases -LRB- except the Fourth -RRB- show him as a far more inventive and bolder composer than do his own revisions.I am also happy that Tintner chose to include the Symphonies `` 0 '' and `` 00 '' . I have long enjoyed `` 0 '' , but I find the `` Schulsymphonie '' rather conventional and uninteresting.At any rate , here is a Bruckner set in superb sound that can stand as the standard recommendation . And at Naxos ' prices , who can resist ?
 I have just finished listening to the complete cycle for the second time . This is the Holy Grail of Bruckner Symphonic recordings . I like it better than the BPO recordings , with him that I used to have . I have put away all of the other ` favorite ' recordings of the symphonies to never to be listened to again , no matter how sumptious , idyosncratic or whatever.After listening and then reading about Maestro Jochum 's growing up with this music and holding it to himself as he would the Bible shows his mastery of these works . My old criteria was to listen to a performance of the 9th as compared to Bruno Walter 's 60 's performance done for Columbia/Sony . Jochum blows him away and the Staatskapelle of Dresden is marvelous . Maybe not as sumptious as the BPO or PHO , but the brass !!! Oh , the brass ! What wonderful a sound . Is it the cathedral or the section itself ? Such power and such a beautiful , dark even mysterious sound . I loved it.If there was a tiny weak spot it had to be the sixth . Maybe I just need to listen to it more . The construction of it seemed to be a little weak . As I say , it might be just me and I am willing to listen to it until it becomes more familiar to me . I had thought the fifth to be the ` quirky ' one before , but Maestro Jochum brings about a different approach to the themes and juxtaposes them either slow or faster , softer or louder or much more expressive than the other recordings I have . The result is the most awesome and powerful performance of the lot.To me , the fifth was his first great symphony and Jochum brings it forth as no other . The seventh , eighth and ninth are also so marvelous to almost be beyond describing.I HAVE JUST ADDED THIS IN !! WHAT PLANET WAS I ON WHEN I LISTENED TO THE 6TH SYMPHONY THE FIRST TIME !!? How magnificent !! This could be the hidden gem in the whole lot ! Bruckner was a monumental mover of blocks of music . That is the only way I can state this . The magnificent way he uses descending scales against ascending scales , and they seem to move upward together . I guess what threw me , the first time , was the melodic construction . The fifth was a curiosity until I heard the awesome , magnificent recording on this set . But , hearing the 6th for the third time now I think this is Bruckner 's homage to Wagner . I thought I heard praises to the ` Ring ' here and the ` Liebestod ' in the adagio . Very beautiful music in this symphony . The finale is the most ecstatic expression , in my mind , of any of the symphonies , yet since I have received this set , these symphonies are the only music I listen to . His music is so holy , to me . A man 's expression of ultimate love of the Creator -LRB- or whatever one calls him/her/energy / spirit-all of the above -RRB- and his effort to make universal music grasped by all lovers of deep , spiritual expression in music . His music is , truly , like no other composers ' and it is worth the listening and re-listening to ingrain the inner movement it creates.One of the reviewers says that if you have heard one Bruckner Symphony you have heard them all . That may be true and what we may be hearing is the composer 's inexorable movement toward perfection and a cyclic expression of it . I seem to have heard threads of earlier symphonies in the later compositions , and it seemed to me to be a complete whole expression of them all . I hope that makes sense . We know that he was constantly revising his work and it works because his music , as idiosyncratic as it is , develops into a surprisingly coherent whole.Bruckner 's music is like no other 's . I think that Sibelius may be the only one to approach the monolithic style of him . I read , one time , Bruckner 's music being compared to other composers and the comment was that other 's were composed to bring joy and whatever . Bruckner 's was to move mountains and this set proves it.I recommend this set the highest of any other that I have on this venue before . An absolute must for any library . Play it when you want to feel close to God or whoever you believe or worship because it will move your heart and soul.Maestro Jochum , thank you for moving this humble man to his very heart and soul
 I have heard these recordings on both Angel and EMI lps , on the first cd boxed set issue , on the more recent `` twofer '' issues -LRB- 3 and 7 , for example -RRB- and on Seraphim cd -LRB- 4 and 9 -RRB- . This new compilation has by far the best sound . This is absolutely beautiful Bruckner , and I do n't know how the riches of these recordings eluded the engineers till now.I just finished listening to symphonies 1 through 3 and the warmth and balance of the sections of the Dresden orchestra remind me of Dutch painting from the 17th century . Everything glows , and seemingly glows from within ! The sheer weight of the sound at the end of the Second Symphony first movement amazed me , and that is just one example.I 'm not sure if these were all originally analog recordings or part analog , part digital as in the von Karajan DG set . Frankly , I do n't care . I 'm just glad they got it right this time !
 This is a great set of Bruckner symphonies by one of the finest conductors of Bruckner , nicely packaged , and at a bargain price . This set includes alternative movements for Symphonies 3 and 4 , the study symphony , and Symphony 00 . Tintner generally prefers Bruckner 's first versions of these tremendous works so if you have either of the Jochum sets pick up this one as well .
 Anton Bruckner has often been accused of writing the same symphony over and over again until he finally got it right toward the end of his life . While this is certainly an overstatement , there is a definate similarity between Bruckner symphonies that is remarkably consistent throughout his output . He always puts the same syle of movement in the same places -LRB- Opening movement , slow movement , scherzo , finale -RRB- , uses the same formal procedures -LRB- rather than the traditional 1st theme/2nd theme/codetta of sonata allegro form , Bruckner masses several themes into a first theme group/second theme group/third theme group -RRB- , an organists approach to orchestration dominated by massive blocks of sound rather than impressionistic effect . These hallmarks of Bruckner 's style span his entire life and output , making him one of the most consistent composers in the repertoire . As a result , if you love one Bruckner symphony , you 'll probably love them all . And visa versa.I fall into the love category . Bruckner 's symphonies are marvelous romantic edifices . At his best , Bruckner can storm heaven and plumb the depths of the psyche in equal measure . They are primarily spiritual testimonies , monuments to Bruckner 's rather simple faith . All of them are worth a listen , and some of them are true masterpieces -LRB- 4th , 7th , 8th , and 9th and maybe the 6th as well . -RRB- I judge my Bruckner symphony cycles by the readings I hear of the 7th and 8th . The 7th is a marvel of symphonic writing . It 's first theme soars out of the orchestra like the Grail theme of Parsifal , but with more power in my opinion . Each iteration of the theme should gather in intensity until the last one leaves you breathless . I have only heard this done supremely twice , once in a recording of a Furtwangler radio broadcast , and once in this reading by Jochum . Both conductors seem to be preternaturally in tune with Bruckner 's aestetic and listening to the 7th is a spiritual experience.The 8th comes from the opposite spiritual realm . The Eighth is initially a tragic symphony . The first movement builds to a grindingly tragic conclusion and the tension developed is n't resolved until the final bars of the piece . It is an overwhelming work . Jochum 's is by far the best reading of this piece I 've ever heard , even trumping the Furtwangler readings I know.Jochum is supreme in all of this repertoire . He made his reputation as a Bruckner specialist , and you can hear his deep love of the composer in every measure . Jochum brings the same level of committment to the `` lesser '' symphonies like the 2nd and 3rd . Under his hand , I find that I like these works much better than I thought I did . I turn to them more than I did before buying this set , though I still spend most of the time with the great works.If you are interested in the complete Bruckner symphonies this is the set to have . It beats the competition hands down . If you just want a sampling of Bruckner , I would still highly recommend Jochum 's accounts . No other conductor , even Gunther Wand who has made such a splash in Bruckner circles , can touch Jochum in his sensitivity and ability to keep a forward line through this challenging repertoire .
 I purchased these symphonies when they were issued individually and have constantly enjoyed Tintner 's insights and the sheer authority of his readings . Although the conductor uses a variety of orchestras , his vision is imparted to whatever band he is conducting and the engineering and acoustics of all the venues are exemplary.It is unfortunate that Georg Tintner committed suicide because of a particularly nasty form of cancer and we are denied his insights into the symphonic cycles of Beethoven , Brahms , Mahler , Haydn , etc.There is being issued in Canada a `` Georg Tintner Commemorative Edition '' and having listened to some of the offerings , his death was a great loss to the world of music and musicology - he wrote his own liner notes to the Bruckner cycle.I highly recommend this set to any Brucknerite as it measures up to and sometimes exceeds the offerings of Jochum - and even von Karajan -LRB- no mean feat , indeed ! -RRB- Timothy Wingate , Ottawa CANADA
 No Brucknerian will want to be without this wonderful cycle.Tintner , a very established Brucknerian of the Gunter Wand mold , handles these symphonies with the skill that only a true veteran can.His vigorous , instinctly authoritative and evocative approach is apparent from the outset.And at budget price , you just can not go wrong .
 Bruckner fans can find other recordings of certain symphonies that might reveal some aspect of the music that this set does not . But I think those recordings are far and few . I know there are Jochum fans -LRB- and I am one -RRB- who find his DG recordings to be superior . Except for the Fourth with the Berlin Philharmonic I have not listened to any of them.So they may be better . But it is a little hard for me to conceive of that being the case because I have found that Jochum has pulled off something nearly miraculous here.I first bought this set back in the very early Nineties when it first was released on CD . I was swept up in the sheer passion , exuburance and religous devotion that is on display . Like other reviewers I think a lot of the credit goes to Staatskapelle Dresden.I find them so involved with Bruckner 's music and the thought world he inhabited that any point of criticism would be nearly useless . `` The petty cavils of petty minds '' , as Samuel Johnson said of some of Shakespeare 's critics.Yes this will be a set I could live with for some time -LRB- I already have ! -RRB- And I would still recomend getting this remastered version because it is superior to the first version and the box takes up far less room . I do n't have the same problem that some people have with the Nowak versions . I do prefer the 1877 version of the 3rd symphony to be superior to Nowak 's . But I find Georg Tintner 's recording on Naxos to be interesting but it is too ungainly and sprawling . So I would prefer the Nowak , though I do n't care for some of the cuts . But even if you have reservations about versions I would still urge you to check out Jochum . I think he will convince you.Enjoy !
 these recordings are revered among bruckner afficandos ; they deserve the approbation - good sound , great and distintive musicianship by the staatskapelle , and jochum 's genius ... without doubt , the best base set of the symphonies .
 I bought this music based on my love of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra 's recordings of Bruckner 's Seventh and Ninth symphonies with Telarc . I thought I might enjoy all of Bruckner 's other symphonies . I was right.The sound quality of these recordings is excellent , and the music is beautiful . I especially like the first movement of the Sixth symphony . It sounds like the music of Heaven here on earth .
 I hesitated before posting a review because I have not listened to the set in its entirety and may revise it in due course . Having played the 00 , 4 , 5 , 7 , and 8 , at this point I can not recommend it in preference to any other full set in modern stereo . It no longer has a price advantage compared to either of the Jochum sets , the Philips Haitink , or the most recent reissue -LRB- at this time -RRB- of the Karajan set as part of his Symphony edition . The latter set can be obtained in the low $ 30 range which makes it unbeatable value . My personal favourite thus far is the first Jochum set . While it is very interesting to listen to the original versions of these works , and I agree with some of the late conductor 's opinions , I think the fairest comparison of this set is against the Eliahu Inbal cycle with the Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra , and personally I prefer the latter in terms of its orchestral playing , recording quality and interpretation . At the moment , the Naxos set offers a price advantage over the Inbal . The Naxos documentation , by the conductor , is very well done . This may seem like a minor detail , but I do not much care for the lilac colored CDs themselves , they actually look rather cheap.The orchestras in the Naxos set do have at least adequate brass sonority for this music , as I found out when playing the 5th . Where I feel there is a lack of weight and richness is in the strings.While I commend Naxos for its desire to release an absolutely complete set of symphonies , I did not find the 00 particularly interesting or memorable and have no intention of hearing it again any time in the near future . The Volksfest alternate finale to the No. 4 was however very good . I would recommend against purchasing this set for the sake of completeness alone , since the performances of the earliest symphonies are available separately - the Nullte No. 0 coupled with the 8th . -LRB- For those who have complained about Tintner 's 8th running into the 90 minute range , the first and third movements have more music in this version than what many are accustomed to hearing . It is not a slow reading . I like this performance . -RRB- This set remains in my view a fairly good purchase for the original versions - and I would encourage every lover of Bruckner to hear them - but do not wish to pay a higher price for the Inbal set .
 These CDs contain performances of the nine Bruckner symphonies.Of these 3,4,7,8,9 are remarkable , with 4 , 8 and 9 beingmasterpieces . The performances by Eugen Jocum and the DresdenStaatskapelle orchsetra are well-designed , and played at tempithat seem to represent the composer 's intentions . The recordingquality is good , except for dynamics
 Finding that no other complete series of Bruckner 's symphonies is recommended more highly than this , in each comparative review I have read , I was happy to procure this compact little box of 9 CDs and to climb the nine mountains , as it were , of Bruckner 's creation.Although I have heard most of the symphonies in performance fairly recently , I ca n't claim to be an authority on them , their various editors or particular points of interpretation . A few discussion ideas might prompt other reviewers to respond , however.A comment offered by someone at a concert recently , where one of the symphonies was about to be performed , went like this
 First off , I say that at -LSB- this price -RSB- , you are getting the Bruckner symphonies for -LSB- very little -RSB- per disc . Now if they were just ok performances , they would be a pretty good deal . But these performances are all nothing less than excellent . Eugen Jochum was truly one of the great Bruckner conductors , and this , his EMI cycle , is his greatest work in Bruckner . He is aided by the spectacular Dresden Staatskapelle . I 'd describe this orchestra as having a very warm , big , well-blended sound . First off , the brass section , while not the most refined you 'll hear , is surely one of the biggest and most full-blooded you 'll hear , always vibrant and energetic throughout every performance . The strings have a very rich , organic quality to them , particularly in the 7th and 9th Adagio 's . Full-blooded and vibrant are again words that come to mind . The somewhat subordinate winds -LRB- Bruckner orchestral writing was proportionately light on winds -RRB- are always very fine . And last , but most definately not least , the timpani makes his due presence known throughout , particularly in the 2nd , 6th , and 9th . Now on to the individual performances.No . 1
 It 's just wonderful , I agree with everybody here , although I thinkBerlin and Vienna are even more superior in sound than Dresden.No doubt about it , Jochum Karajan Haitink , Mehta , Klemperer was great in 4 and 6 . Solti as well , Chicago recording is amazing ! Mehta conducted my first Bruckner 8th with the New York Philharmonic . 1980 . At the Kennedy Center . I 've only heard 4,8,9 on this set . And they give constant enjoyment . Thank God for Anton Bruckner , and Eugen Jochum . I agree . Just wonderful . Conducting students , study hard , I urge you . This how it 's done .
 The other complete set of Eugen Jochum conducting Bruckner 's symphonies , of course , is the series he recorded for DG in stereo between 1958 and 1967 with the Bavarian RSO or -LRB- in Symphonies 1 , 4 , and 7-9 -RRB- the Berlin Philharmonic , following a number of recordings of individual symphonies he made in the pre-LP days . Although Jochum 's basic conceptions remained consistent over the years , that earlier set finds Jochum more consistently alert and a shade more vibrant than in this valedictory go-round with the canonical Bruckner symphonies , taped in the late 1970s . By comparison , the overall impression here is of slightly lower voltage , although the flip side is that this cycle is also just that much more serene , and aptly so -LRB- Bruckner 's music has been described as `` blazing calm '' -RRB- . Even so , this boxed set has a lot to recommend it , whether or not in preference to the DG cycle . There is the burnished and responsive delivery of the great Dresden orchestra , perhaps the oldest in Europe . There is EMI 's warm and atmospheric sound , which in this remastering is considerably better focused and more detailed than in the first CD incarnation of this cycle . This cycle 's Seventh and Ninth Symphonies arguably make a deeper impression than their counterparts in the DG series -- even if the DG cycle compensates with more successful readings of the Fourth and Eighth . Above all , there is Jochum 's lifelong identification with Bruckner 's music -LRB- but NOT , as another reviewer suggested , due to a personal relationship between the conductor and the composer , who had died six years before Jochum was born ! -RRB- . Personal preference will dictate whether you go for the DG or EMI cycle ; either way , you will hear Bruckner via one of the last exponents of a more flexible , less `` monumental '' -LRB- and also less stolid -RRB- approach to this composer 's music .
 Eugen Jochum is regarded by many critics as the foremost interpreter of Bruckner 's music . This splendid Bruckner symphony cycle with the Dresden Staatskapelle is far better than any I 've heard from other conductors , including some contemporary accounts . Jochum leads the Dresdeners in swift performances that are emotionally stirring , replete with ample warmth and brilliance . Although Jochum 's tempi are fast , you do n't miss the vast emotional palette covered in Bruckner 's scores ; he succeeds in illuminating the rich musical textures present in each of Bruckner 's symphonies due to exceptional performances from the Dresden Staatskapelle 's wind , string and brass sections . I doubt I have heard a brass section play Bruckner 's music with such enthusiasm and clarity . The sound quality is fine for these late 1970 's / early 1980 's analogue recordings , though I wish EMI had taken the time to have them remastered using the latest digital image bit technology . Others may prefer Jochum 's earlier Deutsche Grammophon cycle with the Berlin Philharmonic and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra , but frankly , I think this has to be regarded as the definitive Bruckner symphony cycle .
 I have heard Jochum 's and Karajan 's recordings of Bruckner and Tintner grasp of this material equals theirs . The Irish and Scotish orchestras he uses are fully up to the task and the Naxos engineers did a great job getting this on disk just before Tinter 's death . Even if you have other sets this one is worth having because of the rarely performed editions he uses of the second , third and eighth symphonies . Tinter 's commentary in the accompanying booklet is informative and entertaining . The inclusion of the 0 and 00 symphonies is a great bonus .
 Tintner 's is a glorious cycle.There 's a warm glow to these readings which is ultimately awe inspiring.The early symphonies are a particular triumph partly on account of the editions he opts for but also some spectacularly successful slow tempos -LRB- 3rd symphony , ist movement -RRB- Ca n't understand the reviewer below -LRB- Jeffrey Lipscomb -RRB- who describes the performances as sincere but pedestrian.This is most definitely NOT the case !
 This box set is obviously one of the best you can find -LRB- besides the Deutsche Grammophon version -RRB- , conducted by the best Bruckner conductor , Eugen Jochum.He has strength , character , originality , sensitivity , passion , deeply expressed in his conducting
 To win conducting Bruckner demands from a director several issues . You must have a first order orchestra ; second your rapport with the orchestra ; third Bruckner symphonies are a real challenge they are real difficult works because you have to maintain the sound all along the work ; fourth
 Eugen Jochum 's Bruckner set with the Dresden Staatskapelle was issued back in the late 1980s/early '90s on EMI to very high acclaim . FANFARE praised it and the reviewer declared the performances finer in some respects than the performances available on Deutsche Grammophon . The nine symphonies here included were recorded all with the same ensemble , whereas the cycle on Deutsche Grammophon features two orchestras . This re-issue of the nine -LRB- major -RRB- symphonies should be greatly welcomed by aficionados of late 19th century orchestral and symphonic music . Jochum had a unique understanding of Bruckner and his music . Both came from rural and Catholic backgrounds , and both were very familiar with the organ . Jochum 's performances here are warm and human ; textures are clear and very cleanly drawn . Unlike von Karajan 's finely polished presentations , these Dresden performances -- while certainly not neglecting the massive structural lines -- offer us a spiritual Bruckner . Jochum is , IMHO , particularly successful in the 4th , 5th , 7th , and 9th symphonies , perhaps a little less so in the 8th . But , all in all , none of the performances is less than very fine . I must add that Jochum had a special understanding of Bruckner 's 5th , which I think to be one of the most difficult of the symphonies to `` bring off . '' A recent release on Tahra CDs of a Bruckner 5th , performed right before Jochum 's death , makes a wonderful comparison with the Dresden performance . In any case , if you love great symphonic music , you should n't hesitate to acquire this set -LRB- that is , if you do n't already have it ! -RRB- . Sound acoustic and remastering are fine .
 I purchased this box set after having heard only the 7th ,4 th , and 9th symphonies , and each performed by different conductors . Therefore I was very new to Bruckner and hardly understood his symphonies , however I knew there was something special about his music . So I decided to get a Box set since I was resolved on hearing all of Bruckner 's symphonies . I decided on this one largely from the good reviews and the fact that it contained 11 symphonies . Now that I consider myself a Brucknerite and have heard other conductors versions of many of these symphonies in NO way do I regret buying this box set . Although it is not perfect , the 9th ,5 th ,7 th , and 4th being in mind ; the other symphonies are superb . But even this is not the main reason one should hear this set . I value these performances because they represent in mnay cases Bruckner 's original versions . I am thinking mostly about the 3rd and 8th when I say I am very glad I heard these symphonies first before any other versions . It is quite evident that Tintner really loved Bruckner 's music and wished to convey that sentiment to the world . Although this set can not be considered the definitive Bruckner recordings -LRB- the 3rd and 8th come awfully close -RRB- I would warmly recommend it to anyone new to Bruckner , or anyone wishing to hear the Master 's original ideas .
 I bought both Jochum cycles -LRB- DG and EMI -RRB- of the Bruckner Symphonies well over a year ago and listened to them both over and over for several months . I finally reached what I thought was the saturation point and , being afraid I had over-done it , put them away for awhile . I recently decided to listen to them both straight through again , starting with the earlier DG set ; finished that one and moved on to the EMI set -LRB- I 'm on the 6th right now -RRB- and had to come and write a review here at Amazon . My assessment is that the later EMI set surpasses the DG set , but only slightly . They are different enough from each other to justify owning both cycles , and here is where the main difference lies
 I own full or part Bruckner cycles by Karajan , Furtwangler , Celbidache , Giulini , Tintner , Skrowaczewski , Haitink , Wand , and Chailly ... and this Jochum EMI set trumps them all.Enough words have been spoken by others here of Jochum 's imaginitive expertise with Bruckner . I can only add that , if the 5th Symphony 's 2nd movement 6/8 climax before the coda does n't make you feel touched by an angel , then you are ready to join Ted Williams in freeze-dried Heaven . No one else catches Bruckner 's penduluum swing of summer breeze beneath a shimmering sun here like Jochum -LRB- though Karajan and Celibidache come the closest , they are still miles away from Jochum 's aural rapture -RRB- .
 This box set a must-have . Actually , Eugen Jochum recorded all Bruckner twice . First one with Berliner Philharmoniker for Deutsche Grammophon at 60 's , the second is that one with Staatskapelle Dresden for EMI , 70 's . Well , it 's a little complicated to choose one , because both of them have different qualities . But , I suppose , that Dresden version is more transparent , dramatic and intensive than Berliner version.Eugen Jochum is a master on the music of Bruckner . His reading way is totally opposite of Celibidache . Celibidache has the majesty , the sustaining of time in the manner of Zen On the other hand , Jochum has spontaneity , dramatic intensity . You will not bore in any little moment when you 're listening Jochum 's Bruckner . The Staatskapelle Dresden sound is so precise , clear in every minimal detail , you can hear all the counterpointal subjects and parts , very deep and satisfying bass sound , touching strings -LRB- just check the Adagio of 9th -RRB- and glorious brass section -LRB- check the complete 7th -RRB- . The most interesting points that I shall say are
 I consider myself an expert on Bruckner , having at least three performances of each symphony on disk and in some cases -LRB- the 8th and 9th -RRB- considerably more than that . I 've heard all of the `` versions '' -LRB- editions -RRB- of the symphonies , more than once , and have pretty strong opinions . For instance , I think the Haas versions of the 2nd and 8th are greatly to be preferred to earlier or later editions , although -LRB- except in the case of the 4th and 8th symphonies -RRB- first editions -LRB- even including that of the problematic 3rd -RRB- are to be preferred.Having said that , I 've listened to Tintner a lot , and find that all of his recordings are completely committed , and far more convincing that most others on the market -LRB- see
 Both of Jochum 's `` complete Bruckner symphonies '' have long satisfied collectors of every stripe . They 're performed by one of Bruckner 's greatest interpreters and in the EMI set he is at the helm of a unique sounding group of players , the Dresden Staatskapelle Orchestra . It stands up well under `` desert island '' scrutiny . The difference between the DGG and EMI versions has more to do with the orchestras themselves than the interpretations . The EMI is recorded between '79 and ' 82 . DGG derives from the late ` 50s through the late ` 60s with the Berlin Philharmonic and Jochum 's old friend , the Bayerischen Rundfunks . I find the Dresden players give every ounce of energy they have to reach Jochum 's great climaxes . The performances occasionally have an edge to them that the earlier ones do n't contain . Jochum makes huge demands on Dresden in their large church acoustic . On the other hand both the Bayerischen and Berlin orchestras on DGG seem always to have something in reserve . Of course there 's nothing wrong with either approach . At the moment , I like the Dresden the best.Yet most ardent Bruckner fans will not be satisfied with a single conductor for each of these symphonies . In any given box set there is sure to be one with its `` betters '' sitting on a shelf somewhere.In accordance with the last statement , I 'm posting two lists of opinions regarding individual recordings by various conductors , including Jochum , that you might wish to consider as adjuncts to any box set you might buy . You might want to think of looking in some `` used '' sections.The first group is from a friend whose knowledge of Bruckner 's place in the symphonic firmament is all encompassing . The second is my limited opinion because it only covers the 4th to the 9th . That 's because I agree with my friend 's choices on the first three symphonies . It should be noted that both of us have based our choices on years of collecting and listening to all of Bruckner 's grand epics.Let 's start with my friend 's first : `` 1 -RRB- I still think Jochum 's DGG version is the best of the Linz Version - Gunter Wand or Chailly for the Vienna version -LRB- even if Wand never liked to perform it -RRB- 2 -RRB- I like Carragan 's 1873 EDITION best - The best performance is Blomstedt 's with Toronto - next would be Chaiilly in Leipzig -LRB- both are broadcasts -RRB- .3 -RRB- EDITIONS in order of preference
 The words of praise I have about this set are innumerable . It was my first Bruckner cycle ... I grew up with it . It accompanied me in all my times ... and it changed my life.Jochum completely understands Bruckner , and his love for him shines out of every Symphony in this incredible set.Here 's a few things of why I think Jochum 's 2nd set surpasses all others :1 -RRB- His answering to Bruckner 's many spiritual questions .2 -RRB- His searching and quest like feeling he brings to the music .3 -RRB- The meaning , weight and believablility he gives to Bruckner 's vision .4 -RRB- The consistency of dedication throughout all of the symphonies .5 -RRB- The recorded sound is warm , clear and sumptuous .6 -RRB- The orchestral playing shines splendorously throughout .7 -RRB- It seems from the magic aura these recordings have , that it was n't just Jochum who loved Bruckner but also the players , the engineers and even the producers who all worked on this production.I set this bar above Karajan 's recording , Celibidache 's , Haitink 's , Masur 's , Chailly 's , Wand 's , Eichhorn 's , Skrowaczewski 's , Furtwangler 's , Knappertsbush 's , and also Jochum 's first set.A MUST in all households !
 I have listened to Bruckner for more years than I 'd care to admit , but these recordings by Eugen Jochum are like hearing him for the first time . It is startling how good these recordings are , and what freshness Jochum brings to the more familiar Bruckner offerings ... the 3rd , 4th , 7th , 8th and 9th . Electrifying is not too strong a word to describe them . In addition , these EMI recordings are an astonishing value . Buy and listen for yourself . I dare you not to be transfigured by the music-making .
 Not so much a review , but a recommendation
 Eugen Jochum , on EMI , gives the complete Bruckner Symphonies a grandeur and ruggedness other performances lack . Beautifully played as well , and , to boot , well priced .
 This has a very similar track listing to Take A Dip . There are about 5 different tracks on here to Take A Dip . This is a slightly superior album . Producers include Babyface , Daryl Simmons , Tony Rich and Chris `` Tricky '' Stewart amongst others . This may be generic R&B in a similar vein to Boyz II Men , Az Yet and Bobby Brown . But with the quality of songs and their amazing vocal talents it rises above the pack . This album was a commercial flop , so bewildered by this LaFace records got Dallas Austin in to produce a few tracks , dropped some tracks from this album and retitled the album Take A Dip and re-released it . Take A Dip also flopped and they lost their recording contract never to be seen from again . With their immense talents I ca n't understand why none of them got a solo recording contract . Although Demail did pop up on The Braxtons -LRB- Toni 's sister 's -RRB- `` So Many Ways '' album .
 Just to update ... Tone from the group -LRB- my fav -RRB- , he has a channel on YouTube called ToneantonioAFGM ... and is singing solo , and has some singles ... lookin ' great ! Suppoet him
 This CD has an awesome sound . The best songs are , `` Dance '' , `` Did I Hurt You ? '' , and `` Rico '' . If you liked this one , you will love their self-titled new CD . Great bunch of guys with a great message through their songs . You guys rock !
 The Guinea Pig EP is a great intro CD by a great band . I would actually buy their other album , Angry Salad , first , because it will give you a better impression of their music . Listen to Angry Salad and then buy The Guinew Pig EP and listen to `` Did I Hurt You ? '' and `` I Want You Back '' especially . Then go see them in concert because they are absolutely AMAZING live .
 Everything about this cd is great , I first was interested in it because there were guinea pigs on the cover which happens to me my favorite animal . I was actually looking for a cd that has guinea pig noises on it but could n't find anything and this popped up . The music is fantastic . I want more from these guys . You can listen to the clips and see for yourself that they know how to sing and write music . A great buy .

 Sometimes the only way to keep from going insane during a brutal Chicago winter is to take a deep breath , close your eyes and imagine that , rather than waiting in sub-zero temperatures on a windswept , desolate street for a bus that 's never going to come , you 're lying on a beach somewhere , sipping a pi & ntilde ; a colada , your only concern in the world getting the perfect tan . Legendary radio personality Steve Dahl has banked his musical career on the theory that , if your ears are filled with songs about surfing , cocktails and gentle Hawaiian afternoons , this self-delusion will be made all that much easier . Dahl , whose M.O. was proven right in 1992 when Tropic Tides produced the hits `` Margarita '' and `` Aloha Friday , '' tried again five years later with Mai-Tai Roa Ae ' , an album which is every bit as easy-going and fun as its predecessor , but at the same time strikes the listener as distinctly more thoughtful and sentimental.Although he anchors the record with standard Jimmy Buffet-esque tropical-themed pop rock -LRB- `` Mai-Tai Roa Ae ' , '' `` Janet Do n't Go To Jamaica , '' -RRB- , he also tosses in quite a bit of melancholy and wistful reflection , such as on `` Neon Road , '' a reminiscence about old-time road tripping , `` Baseball Summers , '' a rather touching generations-united-by-the-game ballad that evokes Field Of Dreams , and , most notably , `` Coconut Suzie , '' an obviously self-referential tune about an alcoholic whose life is held together , and torn apart , by his addiction.There 's also comedic ditties , such as `` Net Surfin ' U.S.A. , '' a commentary on the then-new phenomenon of the Internet , and `` Flying Over The Ocean , '' which humorously recalls an incident wherein a drunk and high Steve was reprimanded by a flight attendant for disorderly behavior on a plane whose engines failed over the middle of the Pacific . But it 's those deeper songs , the songs of loss and love and fond memory , that make this album worthwhile and hold it together . Whether he intended to or not , Dahl created more than just another disposable collection of upbeat , fluffy vacationtime tunes . Mai-Tai Roa Ae '' s songs are all different from one another , yet combine to make a record that is beautifully coherent ; their varied themes and emotions blend like rum and lime in a well-made daiquiri . Ultimately you 're left with a satisfied smile on your face and a nice warm feeling that makes even a bleak January day in Chicago seem not so bad after all .
 This live recording covers 6 instrumental pieces across the pop/jazz spectrum , brought to life by Benson and his ensemble . The album showcases each player -LRB- unfortunately no details provided on the cd -RRB- going through their paces , from the smoking jazz/blues of Miles Davis ' `` All Blues '' to the lush cool jazz of `` Li'l Darlin '' . With each number running at least 10 minutes in playing time , the ensemble has time to explore the subtleties of each melody and evoke moods not apparent under standard arrrangements .
 Mike sent me a demo of this years ago & I have to admit that it threw me for a loop . I was used to hearing Mike 's previous outfit The Old Joe Clarks & they were almost untouchable in my books as `` Alt-country '' went . Those days were the begining of the end of the Uncle Tupelo era and many of the artists from these bands had started to branch out . Me ? I was still stuck in this scene as I got there late . Luckily I caught up and no matter which side of Mike you listen to , you 'll get a superior songwriter with an ear for melody . Yes , he 's low-key , but I do n't believe he 's lo-fi as other artists tend to be . As with his old group , his laid-back approach is his strenght as opposed to his schtick . Most of these artists do n't last in my ears but Mike 's music is timelss and strong . His latest is great also .
 This music is for us who like Mike . We already know he 's going to give us something lovely and creative . And here it is . He 's not out to grab us and suck us in , evidenced by the first unusually short almost all-instrumental track that just sort of trickles into our ears like rain off a tin roof . We wish he lived on the east coast so we could see him perform and hang out with him .
 Do n't buy the Chess copy of Ca n't Get No Grindin ' instead buy this one it 's a better recording . This also has the album Unk In Funk on it , another fine cd you ca n't go wrong with this one . Great song selection & playing by Muddy and the band , I have the Chess copy of Ca n't Get No Grindin ' not near the quality of this one . In my opinion both albums are excellent , this is great stuff .
 Along comes Liberty City Fla , a group of extremely talented young men who know how to select quality tracks for an album . No these guys do n't do alot of songwriting , but they do everything else right on this self-titled debut.What 's dazzling about Liberty City is their charming melodies & luscious young soulish harmonies mixed smoothly over tightly-packed tracks . Though this set proves to be thin in live instrumentation - it puts much of today 's sythesizer driven music to shame.As for material , the fast-paced , guitar filled `` Dirty Shame '' hits off as the opening track . The album stays solid as it glides over `` What 's a Man To Do '' and `` I Met Her In Miami , '' but does n't reach it 's climax till `` Even Good Girls Go Bad , '' a doo-woppy jam that sends tingles through any musical spine . Recently overused Steve Huff 's joint `` Who 's She Lovin ' Now '' and Devante 's `` Come on Back '' continue a medium paced flow but do n't reach beyond mediocrity.The set really hits a high point again in `` More Than I , '' penned by a wonderful Dennis Ross III -LRB- Uncle Sam , etc. -RRB- that keeps melody lovers happy . `` Cheatin ' '' is a very average track , and a long shot from the work Larry Campbell and Timmy Allen have done on other projects . A spanish guitar leads the way on `` Get Away , '' one of the better songs on this album . `` Out the Door '' starts the winding down process in an incredible fashion , featuring creative harmonies . `` Thank You '' finally caps this great album off with a thanks to the man up above.This set is consistant , and it 's sweet all around . Though it hits a speed bump on `` Everybody C'Mon , '' and does n't vary much from it 's medium pace , it 's a must buy and should n't be overlooked .
 After I heard Cheatin ' from the Shaft soundtrack , I could n't wait for Liberty City album to drop . This group has talent ! The song line-up on this album is very good and the way their voices harmoniously flow togehter makes for a smooth and easy sound .
 Only through a friend who knows my wide taste in music did i find this CD and i was stunned.Incredible harmony along the lines of classic Boys 2 Men with a very distinct flavor of salsa and Cuban influences makes this a very unique sounds worth listening to even if you are n't a R&B ; fan.Wish there was more by this group .
 This album some nice phat joints that any one will enjoy , but because of the commercializing ; the songs on this album get no air time . I know if they did then people would go bannanas ! Great songs like `` who she lovin ' now '' and `` cheatin ' '' are some of the highlights . A + + + + !!
 Hi , I 'm Emilie from London . I thought this album was really refreshing.I can listen to the album without skipping any of the tracks.Devante 's `` Come on Back '' reminded me that He is one of the best RnB producer.This album is one of my favourite album . I have to listen to it at least once a week . But there is something that I really want to know ... Who is Steve Huff ?? The way he writes the songs reminds me of ... R.Kelly !! Could someone give me any information about him ? It will be very much appreciated ... I ca n't wait to hear their next album
 I find it hard to believe that this CD is not getting more publicity than it is . I thought each song was better than the last . Liberty City mixes old school with new school better than any other group . I have n't heard any of these songs on the radio and I just ca n't understand why they are n't all playing . This is one CD you will never put away !! All I have to say is do n't give up guys and thank you !
 Focusing mainly on Overtures this CD is full of delightful music . Personally I have not graduated to becoming an afficanado of operas so I enjoy these type of CDs a great deal . The performance are all quite good though there are better versions out there for certain pieces . If you are a casual classical music listener , or just not a fan of an entire opera this CD is wonderful . If you are a true devotee of Rossini you probably would prefer to collect these pieces in their full context .
 I will not usually recommend a mono CD unless there is no other version of the work in question or the performance is superlative . Well , there are many recent CDs filled with `` the antique music , '' but none bear up so well as the Amadeus reissue of the 1961 < Instrumental Music of 1600 > -LRB- AMD 7007 -RRB- as performed by the Concentus Musicus Wien under Nikolaus Harnoncourt , the man who was one of the pioneers of `` period instruments '' in recordings . Here we have 23 cuts of music from France -LRB- du Tertre , du Caurroy -RRB- , England -LRB- Holborne , Morley , Tomkins , Cooper , Bevin -RRB- , Germany -LRB- Sommer , Posch , Scheidt -RRB- , and Italy -LRB- Cabrielli , Gumai , Massaino -RRB- , all of which is available elsewhere and perhaps some of which is played as well and in better sound . I will deduct a rating-point , however , for its short running time of 46 minutes . But all in all , this is gorgeous music gorgeously played .
 This is an outstanding album , well worth your time . . It is cheaper at Yahoo , however .
 This was Webb 's first album -LRB- actually , `` One Taste of the Bait '' appeared earlier on the WRVU compilation album `` City Without a Subway '' -RRB- and in some ways it shows
 Webb Wilder is one of those artists who ought to be sitting poolside while lesser lights in the music industry serve his drinks . One listen to the tight , addictive rockabilly on this and other Webb CD 's will hook you . Webb is very funny - a seriously good film maker and humorist - and writes songs that stick in your brain and have you tapping your toes all day . Wonderful stuff . Webb Wilder now lives on XM Radio -LRB- channel 12 -RRB- where he spins more wonderful music , and tours with his stompin ' band . Get this CD - it 's rare and valuable and will increase your status among the few full grown men out there . If I remember the name of the tour that supported this album was Economy with Dignity , which tells you a lot about the sense of humor at work here . Plus the music just kicks , plain and simple .
 This is one of the very first cds that I pull out to start the summer off with . `` Poolside '' is one of my favs , as is , `` How Long Can She Last ! Webb even pays homage to the late , great Broderick Crawford !! This set is a real party hearty kinda groove . Buy it !!!
 This CD , being his first release , finds him experimenting a little trying to find his signature sound , which , for a long time Webb fan , is a welcome suprise . The CD is 100 % Webb , but there are hints of other things here as well , and there is even a noticable Elvis influence in some places . It is in no way an attempt to copy Elvis , though . It is very subtile . Like they were influenced by the same music growing up . That 's what I heard , at least.This remastered compilation also sounds great . Some of the best sounding recordings I have heard in a long time . The drums are noticably clear and great sounding.This CD completes my collection . I now own the complete works of Webb Wilder . This CD does not disappoint . It is excellent , and I have never heard a bad Webb Wilder CD . I think that I enjoy it more because it was the last one that I bought , and I can really appreciate the variation on this CD more than if I would have bought it first.He is also great live .
 The 1998 Studio Cast recording of Lerner and Loewe 's `` BRIGADOON '' was superb ! The voices were terrific , but then again - no one can sound exactly like Gene Kelly . Troika International did a tour of `` BRIGADOON '' last year and I went to see it in Missouri . The show was great , so I went out and bought a recording . I wanted the newest recording . To compare with original cast and the MGM cast -LRB- I loved the movie -RRB- , I listened to other recordings . I think I like the 1998 Studio Cast best . If the singers are as good of actors as they are singers , they would be very successful with `` BRIGADOON '' on Broadway .
 This 1998 studio cast album of BRIGADOON features the talented Janis Kelly , and is on the whole a very pleasing and delightful depiction of the Lerner-Loewe score . This album is distributed via JAY 's budget ` Showtime ! ' label.Janis Kelly -LRB- who also appears on the JAY/Showtime albums of SHOW BOAT and A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC -RRB- is a luminous Fiona . As another reviewer has noted , her rendition of `` Waitin ' for My Dearie '' is worth buying the disc for alone , though the fantastic supporting cast includes Ethan Freeman , Megan Kelly and Maurice Clarke.Highly recommended .
 This is one of the best musicals of our day . I do have to admit that Gene Kelly 's voice by far overpowers all other Tommys that I 've heard . However , I believe this guy truly comes in a close 2nd . The voices are truly delightful and make you feel as if you 're right there . I do have to admit i 'd just buy this cd for this rendision of `` Waiting for my dearie ''
 I bought this tape to get the Juice Newton video `` Ca n't Wait All Night . '' Back in the 80s , country videos were scarce , only a handful of songs got the distinction to have an accompanying music video , as it was a relatively new medium . This VHS has 7 classic videos from RCA recording artists . You hardly see these anymore on TV . Alabama 's `` There 's No Way '' is one of their all-time classics , as is Ronnie Milsap 's `` Lost in the 50s Tonight . '' The aforementioned Juice Newton song `` Ca n't Wait All Night '' is awesome , I first saw it on -LSB- ... -RSB- . We also get the Judds ' `` Love Is Alive , '' Waylon Jennings ' `` America , '' Kenny Rogers ' `` morning Desire , '' and Earl Thomas Conley 's `` Crowd Around the Corner . '' 7 great videos from 7 great country superstars ! Let 's hope this sees its release on DVD someday -- soon !
 Radioactive is one of my all time favorite CD 's . Weekend Excursion is an up and coming band who are most defiantly the next big thing on the music scene . This CD is full of energy and music that speaks to the heart . A must have for any music collection !!!
 As expected , Weekend Excursion has a great album with Radioactive . They are an awesome band with a unique sound and great lyrics . Check out their first two cd 's , Weekend Excursion and Five from Six on their website weekendexcursion.com , which in my opinion are a little more down to earth . No matter which of the three cds you listen to though , you 'll be listening to some quality music !
 Keep an eye on this band . They definitely have the potential to go far .
 this cd absolutly rocks , this band out of greensboro n.c is the absolute bomb . buy this cd now !
 This has to be my favourite WE album . Sam has a great voice & the music is poppy , yet keeps things rocking . These guys are as awesome in concert as in your CD player . Get up & dance !
 I took a chance when i bought this CD , I 'd only heard one of the songs , but I 'm glad that I did because I ca n't stop listening to it . They combine great songwriting ability with their incredible musicianship to produce one of the best CDs I 've had the pleasure to listen to in a long time . If you do n't buy this CD you 're missing out on a lot of great music .
 What I found amazing about this boxset is the opportunity to enjoy Bach in complete form . From my point of view Passacaglia performed by Werner Jacob is a five star performance . Also BWV 593 and BWV 596 push up and show up no limits for the listener . This 16 CDs aggregate the perfect union between the artist , instrument , listener and Bach . And at the end of the day I can say that organ works can still be ... trendy . Enjoy !
 121 organ tracks or works on 16 CDs has to be spaced out in about six days . The music is so restful I found myself dowsing . The price for a new set through Amazon was right . Bach organ hymns made Luther .
 I am a big fan of opera and know Alagna 's drawbacks as most do , but this is wonderful.The best christmas album i have ever heard.classical styling for o holy night and adeste fideles.a lighter sound for `` for the love of a child '' and white christmas.nice renditions of first noel and o tannebaum.Glorious Silent night in french english and german.A sensationally emotional Ave Maria not over burdened by forcing the voice.Gaurdian angels up there with Lanza 's version.Best of all french classic Petit Papa Noel , stunning !!!
 If you want to hear a great Christmas Album this is it !!!! Popular Christmas ... not sacred songs !! I like it A lot !! It 's sound to easy to hear !!! And he 's great !!!

 Jeff Hamilton 's CD It 's Hamilton Time -LRB- Yes it just came out after MC Hammer 's wave of fame -RRB- showcases a jazz trio playing tight , intelligent tracks . This is one of my favorite jazz CDs ! Though JH has played for many other famous players , I do n't think he 's as well known as he SHOULD be . I found out about him only because he happens to be from my home town of Richmond , Indiana . But , he could have easily come from some hip place on the west coast , the way this CD rocks .
 If you 're a fan of Cuban music , this set is for you . What excellent music !
 This is a classic album by Cleo Laine and John Williams recorded in 1976 . All the carefully chosen tracks are expertly sung and played . You will find a more gentle but still passionate Cleo on this cd . A great late night album , totally different to her jazz recordings . Worth the price alone for `` He Was Beautiful '' . Other stand out tracks include `` Eleanor Rigby '' , `` Wave '' and `` Killing Me Softly .
 This is the essential album to have in your collection . Anyone who has ever loved , lost , dreamed and experienced the emotional realms of living - then this album will fill in all the gaps of feelings and emotions that can not be put into words.Whether or not you are a Cleo Laine fan , this album is a must have . If you are not touched by Cleo 's rendition of any or all of the songs , then you have no heart and must surely be dead .
 This video collection from Rush showcases some of the most brilliant work in their history . One of the best aspects of this collection is that most of the songs recieved little if , any airplay . So it is a great opportunity to see and hear some truly creative work from one of the world 's best , -LRB- AND MOST UNDERRATED -RRB- rock bands . Highpoints of the collection include The Body Electric and The Enemy Within from the Grace Under Pressure album and Vital Signs from the Moving Pictures album.But the finest work in this collection is Countdown from the Signals album . The band wrote the song in honor of the space shuttle Columbia 's first liftoff and the video has excellent scenes from the launch .
 A valuable piece to my Rush collection of vhs , tape was not brand new but that 's ok
 How this slipped into the cracks of music history , I have no clue . Family Fodder is easily one of the best bands ever , combining the catchy/quirky new wave of Blondie , The B-52s and Devo with the rampant experimentalism of The Residents and This Heat . Stereolab are obvious fans -LRB- listen to `` Der Leiermann '' if you do n't believe me . -RRB- `` Debbie Harry '' and `` Silence '' are THE TWO GREATEST `` NEW WAVE '' SONGS EVER . I promise . `` Savoir Faire '' is n't far behind , and is extra special because it features two members of This Heat.Family Fodder is really too good to be called a new wave band . It 's an insult to put them in the same category as The Knack . They transcended new wave -- their music might as well have been put out yesterday . It honestly has n't dated a day.I wish I could buy everyone in the world a copy of this music . The world would be a better place .
 This is a masterpiece without a bad track on the disk . Although he is known as a New Age musician , his roots as a progresive rock musician are obvious . The melodies are gently like most New Age music , but the layers of instruments blend to create an amazing tapestry of sound . There is a wonderful blend of electric and acoustic music creating a sound that can one can get lost in . Well worth a listen !
 I bought the vinyl album before CDs came out . I wore out 2 albums because silence is the answer is one of the best recordings of all time to go into a deep meditative trance . Each time I experience this with headphones especially after breathing it transports one to another reality . If your into meditation , breathwork , light/sound machines , or just enjoy being in altered states of conscieneness , , this is perfect
 This is the best music Deuter has ever made , especially the first CD -LRB- there are two -RRB- . I can not understand how this CD is not much more famous.Just lay on the bed , close you eyes and listen to the music.The meditation will follow naturally.Highly recommended !
 Un bon album , pour ceux et celles qui veulent s ` impr&eacute;gner dun flux musical m&eacute;langeant la transe , l' &eacute;veil sensitif et la relaxation . Du silence aux m&eacute;lodies , l'album &eacute;merveillera les auditeurs friands du nouvel ge , terme que le remplacerais volontiers par ambiant . &Agrave; conseiller fortement !
 Bonnie Tyler had hits with Lost In France and It 's A Heartache before she teamed up with Jim Steinman and created the album Faster Than The Speed Of Night which was a sort of female version of Meat Loaf 's Bat Out Of Hell . The album was a megahit on both sides of the Atlantic and gave her top 5 hits in the form of Total Eclipse Of The Heart and the title track . Her husky voice is backed by powerful rock instrumentation , rolling , pounding drums , shimmering keyboards and blistering guitar riffs . This comprehensive Best Of collection includes her other great hit Holding Out For A Hero plus a stunning version of Have You Ever Seen The Rain and a duet with Shakin ' Stevens . The tracks from Faster Than The Speed Of Night are exuberant and theatrical , but her sensitive side is also displayed here on songs like the aforementioned Lost In France . If you love hook-filled big rock sound of artists like Pat Benatar , Joan Jett , Meat Loaf , Ellen Foley , Tina Turner or Jim Steinman , you 'll love this album .
 Have you ever seen the rain
 This is a video collection of music videos from Starship 's Knee Deep In the Hoopla album , which catapulted the veteran group to pop superstardom in 1985/1986 . The group 's success , no doubt , was partly attributed to the MTV-ready music videos . This collection includes `` We Built This City '' , `` Sara '' , and `` Tomorrow Does n't Matter Tonight . '' Look for Grace Slick and the other members of the band playing cameos in the Mickey Thomas led `` Sara . '' Grace plays a woman that is protecting the young Mickey during a tornado .
 You have to get this CD Lisa Daggs is GREAT ... have to hear it to believe it
 Lisa Daggs-Charette is my favorite singer . Love Is The Bottom Line gave Lisa more # 1 radio singles than any of her other five albums . My favorite songs include `` Be Like Noah '' , `` Hands On The Plow '' , `` Savin ' For A Rainy Day '' and `` The Gift '' although the whole album is awesome . It is a defent country album . I am not a country fan but Lisa has changed that for me . Through her music , Lisa , shares her failures and victories in her life as well as her former drug and alcohol addiction . She has a powerful voice and has a lot of energy . She currently has six albums and 14 # 1 radio singles . She has won numerous awards over the years for her voice and albums . She still performs numerous concert dates around the country each year . She has also been featured on a few of the Bill Gaither and Friends Homecoming Videos and dose a number of concert dates with them each year . Over all she is an awesome artist and I highly recommend this album and all her other albums to you ! Check out her site at www.lisadaggs-charette.com .
 This is great music . A nice smooth country sound and tempo . I purchased it for myself , but my twelve year old daughter has nearly taken over . She really likes `` Be Like Noah '' . My favorite is `` Hands on the Plow '' Anyways , I would thank Lisa for utilizing her talent to create such great music .
 Each time I hear this music I love it more . I listen to it on my way to work and it puts me in a wonderful frame of mind for the whole day . Her voice is so clear and beautiful , her timing is excellent , and her message is `` right on '' .
 Lovely music that fills the heart . It 's great to listen to country music and hear positive endings to the lyrics . Lisa has done a great project and we sure enjoy her voice !
 this is a must have recording . Excellent performances led by the conductor most associated with the composer . You all know the `` Thomas Tallis '' and the `` Greensleves '' , but RVW was so much more . Listen to the Third Symphony ... a quiet elegy for the generation lost to WWI . Good stuff .
 This composer 's music has fascinated me since playing some of it in high school -LRB- 1966 -RRB- . I had never found as complete a selection , recorded so well .
 This is a `` bargain , '' sort of . But Ralph Vaughan Williams is not Beethoven ; unless one is VW `` completist '' one does n't really need the unifying vision of a great conductor in a recorded cycle of all nine symphonies with the same orchestra . So it 's worthwhile & fun to assemble a VW cycle from a variety of sources . I recommend unreservedly the ethereal Boult # 3 & # 5 -LRB- the former with lovely Brit soprano Margaret Price -RRB- , & his Job Masque & # 9 on Everest -LRB- the latter recorded the day after VW died -RRB- . Actually , any of the recordings in this set are fine . But there are others equally accomplished or even better
 The British are admirable loyalists when it comes to their own composers . Symphonies by Bax , Arnold , Rubbra , Simpson , and others that are nevre played in the U.S. are daily fare to music lovers in the UK , which heated discussion about the best versions . By comparison , how much do American music lovers argue over the symphonies of William Schuman , Roy Harris , Roger Sessions , Leonard Bernstein , John Harbison , or champion of them all , with symphonies by the dozen , Alan Hovhaness?Of the British crop , the only works that cross the Atlantic with any frequency are Elgar Sym . # 1 , Walton Sym . # 1 , and a handful of the Vaughan Williams nine . Boult 's second set of the VW symphonies , in stereo for EMI as opposed to mono for Decca , is all anybody really needs . Some of the performances have been bettered individually -- one thinks of Handley 's VW First , Bernstein 's Fourth , Barbirolli 's Second , Stokowski 's historical Fourth and Sixth . Boult has a fine orchestra in the London Phil . and good analog sound from EMI ; his readings are dramatic and interesting , if not always deep.If this were a Beethoven cycle , I 'd want three or four alternative sets . Here it 's not necessary . You can own all of VW 's symphonic output and be assured that each reading is good enough to do justice to the music . Of course , this wo n't be enough for real enthusiasts , yet for Americans time might be better spent uncovering the shamefully neglected symphonic past -- and present -- of our native composers .
 My first exposure to V W 's symphonies happened back in the 1970 's courtesy of Boult 's earlier recordings -LRB- # 1-8 on London and Decca LPs , and # 9 on an Everest LP -RRB- . Later I acquired all of Boult 's stereo recordings on Angel LPs . Here we have the latter recordings in their best-ever transfers . Despite strong competition from Handley -LRB- EMI -RRB- and Previn -LRB- RCA -RRB- , I feel that over-all this Boult set -LRB- Boult II -RRB- remains THE one to own in good stereo sound . However , Boult 's earlier set -LRB- Boult I - now available on Decca CDs in top-notch transfers -RRB- features even better performances of Symphonies 4 , 6 and 9 . I own them both , along with a few individual symphony readings by other conductors . Here 's a brief summary of the performances : # 1 . I wo n't mince words here
 `` You got the score right into you and through you into the orchestra . `` So wrote Vaughan Williams to the thirty year old conductor Adrian Boult in 1918 after a performance of A London Symphony . Subsequently Boult conducted and championed Vaughan Williams ' works constantly . Many times he recorded and premiered them . This slim-line box , containing all the symphonies and many other items , all recorded in stereo and mostly in the warm Kingsway Hall acoustic between 1967 and 1975 , ought therefore to be self-recommending . It must be said that Vaughan Williams as a composer has tended to polarize listeners . Detractors say that he had neither the architectural vision nor the construction skills necessary for a symphonist . They point to the fact that he himself hesitated to name and number many of his works as symphonies , and that one of them is merely a re-cycled film score . They contain , moreover , many awkward and ungainly rhythmic figures that tend to cheapen them . Champions argue that the music is wonderfully evocative of its time , that many beauties are to be found therein , and that at least three of the works deserve to remain in the international repertoire forever.Internet browsers , wondering which Vaughan Williams purchases to make , need to balance several factors before selecting this box . The octogenarian conductor , Sir Adrian Boult , directs with authority and knowledge , but nevertheless does not always elicit the very best performances -LRB- as in No 7 -RRB- available or the very best performances of his own recorded versions -LRB- as in No 2 and No 6 -RRB- . Against this must be balanced the benefits of relatively modern recording and reprocessing , together with the benefits of low cost and compactness.Perhaps there are no other internet browsers who , like me , heard Vaughan Williams conduct . At an orchestral concert in London in the early 1950s , devoted to his works , he conducted his own Fourth Symphony . As a young audience member I reckoned that he obviously was not the world 's best conductor . A tall , big-framed figure , he kept his eye on his own score and beat time with the baton . Nowadays , I am happy to recommend and own this box of his works , while ensuring however that other versions of them are in my collection .
 THIS nice looking blue box is also a nice sounding set of CDs , introducing some perennial works by Vaughan Williams . My only reproach goes to the rather `` clumsy '' sleeves -LRB- each disc is packed individually though -RRB-
 What is a definitive recording ? Is such a thing even desirable ? If so , these may be the closest we will get to an understanding of how Vaughan Williams intended his symphonies to be performed . These recordings , however , go so much further than simply being an encyclopedic collection . Boult and Vaughan Williams enjoyed a mutually beneficial collegiality and warm friendship . Boult gave the premier performances of many of these works . Most , if not all , of these recordings were made under the attentive supervision of the composer . The wonderful biography of the composer , which was written by his second wife , chronicles many of these events in a most humanly interesting way . On the other hand , Michael Kennedy 's monumental book analyzing the complete works of the composer adds some technical details about these recordings , which are of interest to anyone devoted strongly enough to RVW to want to have his complete symphonic output on cd.All of the recordings are better than very good . The technical work of remastering has been done to perfection . The performances are full blooded , expressive and exciting . Everyone will have his own favorite among these discs , but to this listener the ` Tallis Fantasia ' and ` Sinfonia Antarctica ' stand out over other recordings of the same works . The `` Fantasia on a Theme of Thomas Tallis '' was originally composed for and performed in a cavernous cathedral space at a Three Choirs Festival . This performance communicates the mysticism of the work in a way in which I have never heard anyone else succeed . Likewise , `` The Sinfonia Antarctica '' or `` Symphony No. 7 '' is here performed with the poems and excerpts from Scott 's journal read by a young Sir John Gielgud before each movement . This does very much to enhance the total effect . Remembering that this was initially film music , later adapted into a symphony , only heightens one 's estimation of the composer . Vaughan Williams was a bold and progressive artist , firmly rooted in the great mainstream tradition . As he labeled Holst and himself
 For both the serious or casual listener of Vaughan Williams music , I consider these recordings a must ! Only a scant few conductors -LRB- John Barberolli , Thomas Beecham , and Adrian Boult -RRB- , could do justice to his compositions . One slight -LRB- very slight -RRB- flaw is that the second piece of his English Folk Song Suite -LRB- My Bonny Boy -RRB- , is a wee bit quick in tempo . Other than that , this collection is truly outstanding . Let me also state that since this review is being written on Thanksgiving , there is n`t a `` Turkey '' in the lot ! Sorry for the pun .
 I agree with Roger Lakins , who first reviewed this set -LRB- q.v. -RRB- on every point of judgement - these are great performances which you can absolutely trust as true to the spirit of the music . However , they were not made under the personal supervision of RVW , who died in 1958 . That was true of Boult 's earlier set . made originally for Decca in the 50s , a set of 1-8 , not 9 , which was not recorded at the time . This older set is available on a cheap British label called Belart , and many critics would rate it even more highly than the EMI set under review here . But no-one should hesitate about this set - it 's still first-rate .
 The VW symphonies have done remarkably well on disc . Complete cycles by Previn , Haitink and Tod Handley all make substantial claims . Individual symphonies from Richard Hickox , Andrew Davis , Vaughan Williams himself and , of course , ` Glorious John ' Barbirolli -LRB- as VW christened him -RRB- also demand attention . But , if you 're looking for a complete overview of the Vaughan Williams symphonic canon -LRB- plus quite a lot of substantial extras -RRB- then this Boult set is probably still the best all-round recommendation.Even he has a substantial rival in his earlier self on Decca , conducted under the gaze of the composer who delivers a touching speech of thanks to the players at the end of the pianissimo finale of the Sixth Symphony . This earlier Decca version probably has the edge for urgency and thrust in the quicker movements , but the sound on these later discs benefits enormously from the full warm stereo production typical of EMI in the 70 's and also benefits from Sir Adrian 's lifetime experience of these works.In many ways , it is the earlier symphonies that come off best in this series . A wonderfully full-blooded Sea Symphony with a finely disciplined chorus , excellent soloists in John Carol Case and Sheila Armstrong -LRB- though she ca n't eclipse the magical Isobel Baillie in the older Boult set -RRB- , and a rich Kingsway Hall acoustic get the set off to a fine start . The London Symphony was always special with Boult
 Done more than 30 years ago , these recordings are still the best available of Ralph Vaughan Williams ' orchestral music . The sound is here and there a little dated , but usually strongly competitive with present digital recordings . And the musicianship -- the wisdom of Adrian Boult and the high level of playing and singing -- really carry the day . Teaching a Lifelong Learning Institute on 20th Century Romantic composers this winter , I not only recommended but urged the participants to buy this set.Vaughan Williams is one of the finest symphonists ever -- a thorough-going craftsman -- whose music connects the English countryside of a hundred years ago to the agonies of war and uproar of the century just past . People will be listening to this music long after the academics have come and gone ; and this recording will still be the benchmark .
 Of all the sets available , this is the one to get . Each symphony is treated well , particularly the 3rd and 5th , which for me are two of the very greatest symphonies of the 20th century . EMI gathers all of the great recordings of Boult , who was probably the all-around best Vaughn Williams conductor , and issues them in a very nice looking package . -LRB- I admit I am a sucker for collections issued or re-issed in small , more easily handled box-sets . EMI leads the way in this respect . -RRB-
 Vaughan Williams seems to be a composer that not many people talk about as oppose to say someone like Stravinsky or Sibelius , but I 'm here to tell you that you can put aside any thoughts you have had about him , because chances are you have n't heard Sir Adrian Boult 's readings of this astonishing composer . Boult actually knew Vaughan Willams and premiered some of his works to the general public . Perhaps it is Boult 's interpretations that I find to be the most rewarding . Since he had connections with the composer himself there is something very personal about these performances . No question about it . This is an essential box set for any Vaughan Willams fan.On this release , Boult conducts the London Philharmonic , London Symphony , and the New Philharmonia Orchestra . Obviously these are top orchestras and they all turn in fantastic performances.This 8-disc box set collects all of Vaughan Williams ' symphonies and almost all of his orchestral works . What I find interesting is the omission of such great pieces as `` Oboe Concerto '' and `` Variants of Dives and Lazarus . '' It 's no big deal though , because there is enough music here for you to absorb and listen to for a while.I would definitely say this box set is worth it 's weight in gold . Pickup one as soon as you can , I 'm not sure how long this particular set with be made available . In these times , it 's hard to say . Enjoy the music !

 While this disc was originally marketed in the ' 70 's , it is timeless ... truly evergreen . And with Hansi 's treatment of his `` non-stop '' approach , the disc is a winner . For the uninitiated , the `` non-stop '' approach is recorded live with audience participation that proved so successful beginning with his `` non-stop dancing '' series back in the mid ' 60 's . The James Last touch is applied to recognizable standards that you like to sing-along with and even dance to . This disc is an excellent choice for your easy listening collection .
 I love everything this man and his orchestra does . You simply ca n't go wrong with James Last or Richard Clayderman !!
 This concert tape showed Laura at her height . It reminded me how good she was . She should n't have died so young .
 This concert is a little of a roller coaster ride . Bothe the audio sound quality of her voice and the musical quality oscillate between outstanding and mediocre . The high points are the electric version of `` Gloria '' at the end and a spectacular version of her own written masterpiece `` I wish we could be alone '' '' `` Ti Amo is also good . The opening `` Lucky One '' and `` Satisfaction '' are dissapoionting I have to make this evalution as a die hard Laura an in the 80 's and 90 's . I do n't know why the audio quality of her voice reproduction varies from excellent to lousy from song to song but it does . This tape is also a moving story of her personality which Branigan fans will appreciate much I do
 This is a great VHS ! Watching and hearing Laura sing and dance non-stop is great fun . So sad to have her out of our lives -- thank heavens for CDs and tapes .
 This concert is a must have for every laura branigan fan , although only '' Self Control '' is a video clip as an extended version , the rest of the songs are live performances , 10 videos total and they are as follow :1 . The lucky one -LRB- live -RRB- 2 . All night with me -LRB- live -RRB- 3 . Satisfaction -LRB- live -RRB- 4 . Ti Amo -LRB- live -RRB- 5 . Wish we could be alone -LRB- live -RRB- 6 .

 At once upon a time i was so lucky to have owned this tape all though I remember the good 80 's in my life and do remember owning this at 1 time . Thanks mom . Okay I read somewhere recently that laura released a spanish album/cd . i am searching for corect information and the title and a site to purchase . Sincerly a true laura Branigan fan always . 1 day Laura I will see you .
 Great selection of some classic tunes meticulously produced and compiled by Jim Ladd and the late , great , John Hearne . Various artists perform songs that depict a cross section from blues to rock , from Clarksdale to Cleveland .
 If you are new to blues or an avid blues fan , you will love this compilation . It weaves together a variety of both classic blues gems and more modern blues renditions . Seriously , from blues queen Koko Taylor to the Doors ! It 's great for a commute or party . Big thumbs up .
 This is a GREAT CD ! The first surprising turn of this awesome collection is a fantastic mixing and mastering job that makes these songs come alive with the passion and greatness of each track and artist on this CD . Then if you read the liner notes as you listen , you discover the undercurrents of the concept and people that brought these songs to you for your listening pleasure , and why it is such a great listening experience . If that 's not enough for you , it may shock you to learn that from your entry into the `` Roadhouse '' , until your `` Blues Hangover '' , the songs are mixed together by carefully sliding each track into the next like a bottle neck sliding up and down the neck of a classic road tested guitar . Or you can just road test the CD in your favorite set of wheels , where just listening to these blues can make a conscienciously chosen economical hybrid seem like a fine-tuned hunk of late 60 's muscle . If that 's not enough for you , I doubt that there is anything more I can say to help you decide on this classic collection.John A Whalen
 Chitose Okashiro does a fantastic job playing my favorite Ryuichi Sakamoto piano pieces . The CD was water damaged and it still sounded perfect -LRB- purchased used with the warning that it was damaged , but played fine -RRB- . For pianists , most of Ryuichi Sakamoto 's sheet music is available on his web site with the unfortunate exception of ' A Flower Is Not A Flower ' .
 I 've been waiting with bated breath for a new song/CD from the brilliant Prodigy ! These guys EAT Fat Boy Slim and Moby for breakfast ! Liam 's genius shines through once again , and the boys complete the circle by sticking to their hardness . BUY THIS SINGLE ! It 's FANTASTIC ! And if you have a chance to see these lads live -- GO ! Their shows are amazing and exhausting at the same time !
 I dont know why everyone disowns this track , Babys got a temper is soo heavi filled wid an excelllent indurstial beat , sick guitar riffs and headthrashing lyrics from a punked out keith flint .
 This is Prodigy 's first release of new music since 1997 's Fat of the Land -LRB- they released a DJ mix album , Dirtchamber Sessions Volume 1 , in 1999 , which is good . -RRB- Baby 's Got a Temper has a slow , drugged-out kind of beat . Not slow in a dragging or boring way , just drugged-out . The whole song sounds pretty trippy.The track has lots of little sounds and quirky noises , which sound pretty cool . Keith is doing the vocal delivery , and does pretty well . There 's a little electronic loop that sounds like a scary nursery rhyme.This song mainly just lacks the force and driving energy that a lot of Prodigy songs are known for . However , that is not to say it 's bad . It 's just different.It 's not really one of my favorite Prodigy songs , but I was really happy it came out , and I look forward to their new album , currently titled Always Outnumbered , Never Outgunned.p.s . - Liam Howlett , the main man of the Prodigy , has himself stated that Baby 's Got a Temper sounds more like something off of the Fat of the Land album . This song is not necessarily attempting to break new ground . He also admitted , more recently , that the release of the single was due to the record company . That 's not necessarily a bad thing , though.I 've heard some of the material from the new album , and it sounds pretty good . Also , Liam has stated that Baby 's Got a Temper may not even be on the new album . And , according to Liam , at least another single is planned to be released before the album is .
 Before I say anything about the music , I have to credit Prodigy for having the balls to have their newest release in 5 years be a single with non-stop drug references and an a capella mix so we can clearly hear every word.Ok , on to the music . Baby 's Got A Temper is a VERY easy to digest track ; down tempo , distorted guitar tracks , cathcy hook , etc. . Personally I was looking forward to a much more uptempo track but I have a feeling this is not going to be the best of Always Outnumbered Never Outgunned . At the same time , I think BGAT has the right stuff to re-introduce the band into the current music scene and even win new fans.The Dub Mix was kind of dissappointing really , not different or -LRB- bassy -RRB- enough in my opinion . It 's not a bad track , but it does n't live up to the standard of older Prodigy dub mixes.I do GREATLY appreciate the inclusion of the instumental version of the track . I always enjoy being able to really listen to every nuance of the song minus vocals.The A Capella mix is interesting in the way that you can really hear all of the production of the vocals that get lost in the complete track.Overall , if you 're a fan , you probably already have it so there 's not much more to say . If you 're new to the group , do n't hesitate to pick this disc up and discover some great new music .
 Although I reckon this is a pretty similar track to Firestarter I like it none the less . It 's creepy lyrics and violent threatening tempo are pretty good , and I guess when it 's on the dancefloor , pretty ironic.Check out the video with the cattle milling around ; you do n't have to hear the Ropyhnol lyrics to understand this one . Although somehow it 's never been contraversial in the sense that the slightly mis-aligned smack my Bitch up was.It get 's the party going so you can forget it all and enjoy the rest ... ; -RRB-
 Prodigy 's first single in 5 years is certainly nothing ground-breaking , but it 's still good and certainly indicates some growth in the group 's sound , as opposed to some people who say it sounds like a half-baked Fat of the Land song.True , it does have plenty of familiar FOTL-style ingredients
 Liam and Company are back and just in time . This single from `` Always Outnumbered , Never Outgunned '' is an explosive calling card . Fans of the last records hits will not be disappointed . Starting off with somewhat demented carnival-esque keyboard loop the song launches into a full on assault o of Keith Flint 's trademark English snarl , Howlett 's beatsand very cool Girls Against Boys style distorted guitar.This is the only eletronic band that can rock just as hardas any rock band out there , any witness to The Prodigy livewill tell you that . Welcom back boys , just in time .
 If you 're a fan of the prodigy already you 'll definitely like this single . I do n't know why people are putting it down so much though I do agree just as with Firestarter Kieths vocals do get annoying which is why the instrumental version is a must . My only criticism is that htis single is exaclty just what you 'd expect and nothing different . . hopefully we 'll hear a new sound from the prodigy with the release of their upcoming album .
 The Prodigy are back ! `` Baby 's Got A Temper '' is a fantastic record - just whatwe need right now in an age where all the music industryhas to offer is endless , dire amounts of pop-garbage . The only bad thing I have to say about this great CD isthat the other mixes do n't vary too much from the originaltrack , being a dub and instrumental -LRB- respectively -RRB- . I wouldhave preferred a couple of new tracks.That said , `` Baby 's Got A Temper '' is such a great , catchy song , that I still enjoy the other versions and Ijust ca n't get enough of the tune itself anyway ! :-RRB- Great video too !! Absolutely recommended !
 Great song for electronic rock music lovers and fans of Prodigy . Since the band has disavowed the song ; this was the only way to get a digital copy of the track . Ca n't even find this one on music download sites because I think they have even removed it from their official music catalog . Wish there was more tracks on the EP though .
 Everyone seems to hate this single but I really like it and I have gotten my roommate into liking prodigy just because of this single . I would agree that it is a bit lacking but I would n't guess that they 've been trying to make a cd for 6 years , guys . They have to have gone vacation or just a break in general after the Dirtchamber sessions came out . So I would say that 's a bit unfair to make that claim . Anyways I 'm a diehard prodigy fan and own almost every single song they 've put out -LRB- except the What Evil Lurks E.P -RRB- and I would suggest anyone who is like me to pick up this single .
 So im sitting here , naked , right ? and im thinking to myself , Oh yeah ! i was doing a review for this album . Well , a few main points on this album : - Overall , a very impressive , very heavily made , politically messaging album-obviously very deserving of the 5 stars i gave it-impressive , addicting riffsI am thinking , though , that this album is not as good as their first , self titled album . It seems that , with the album STEAL THIS ALBUM ! that they are degenerating quickly . This album depicts the start of the fall of this band . All of the songs are impressive , but contemplating what has been going on in the first album , it is not as impressive . System of a Down has come up short , starting out acceptably but then to go down to their next album.I would n't like to stray away from what i am saying , but this band progressively lost touch to their original style . If and when they release a fourth album , i would probably stay away from it .
 The First Review of this album I read critisized it for being another Nu-Metal band whining about life . What on earth are you talking about ? Maybe it has Nu-Metal riffs , but the lyrics in songs like Prison Song , Chop Suey , Science , and Psycho are fiercly political ... not whining at all . Unless you are a ultra-conservative maniac who considers people conserned about teh state of the world under the riegn of Dubya ... Another person complaines that science -LRB- the song -RRB- is bad is because it says that science is bad and faith is good . Idiot ! Do you not see that they are making fun of religious fundamentalists and other organized religious groups ? Another complains that this is dumb corporate rock that is bland nu-metal . This is incredible creative and new . And there is no ugly rapping like Rage Against the Machine - yes , it sucked - so there - and I like soundgarden too ... Anyway , it seems to me that it isnt System of A Down that is complaining ... it 's all these whiny amazon.com reviewers ... Anyways , the review . This is a fabulous creative funky fun energetic political masterpiece . Blender -LRB- a review magazine -RRB- wrote it as one of the best 500 albums made ever.The Prison Song
 Toxicity Has many good songs , System of a down has hit it big with this Cd , i think that it is way better than there first Cd , you should really get this one if you like Rock .
 I listen to all types of music , and this is why I think the album `` Toxicity '' by the divinely wrathful System Of A Down can be the best album released in the last hundred years , or seems that long ... so here are my highly unbiased opinions , hope they are of some assistance . . Prison Song - Sounds like Ozzy beginning `` Crazy Train '' , but a lot faster , more tension , and of course , better voice . Prison Song makes moot points , but regardless of that , it 's a great intro that punches in the face right off the bat . The chorus gets a little annoying after a whle , and Daron 's lines are sort of dubm , but of course you can turn a deaf ear once in a while . Sort of like the Beatles ' Revolution , but standing stronger . 7/10Needles - ... this song is explosive ! Great lyrics , great voice , great tempo . I ca n't help but think they 're implying that the gov ' t implants some sort of device in us that tells us our daily routine , like a control chip . Not a smart plot , but the messages are there , I 'm sure of that . Reminds me of Nirvana 's `` Lithium '' , very egoistic , but gives no reason about anything . 8/10Deer Dance - Thundering intro , makes you wan na destroy whatever room you 're in . This song 's lyrics contain more intelligence than than those of the Hives ` and the Vines ` lyrics , of their whole CD 's !! Listen and judge for yourself . It kinda -LSB- is bad -RSB- when it slows down , but hey , the fact that this song actually requires a brain for it to be heard , makes it better . Very political , somewhat controversial , but yeah , cool song . 6/10Jet Pilot - `` Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot , one that smiled when he flew over the bay . '' Do n't know , I 'm wondering what the ... they mean too . But cool tempo song , goes really fast , with those lyrics , then slows down to more incomprehensible poetry , then increasingly fast again . Lyrics should remind you of RHCP 's `` Scar Tissue '' , same topic , if under any classification at all , but Serj 's lyrics are too advanced . 7/10X - This song is System Of A Down 's attempt to tell us that we are overpopulated . In my opinion , they 're wrong . Still very thought-provoking , but , gives no reasons to anything . Very short , and , yes , still more entertaining than the White Stripes . Serj contradicts himself , saying `` we do n't need to multiply '' , then later , `` we do n't need to nullify '' , but , asking the people to stop reproducing is nullifying . Unless he thinks more people means more killing , but , you know , this confusion can be avoided if they post something on their web site at least . Above average song in the end . But remember , above average in the best CD of the last hundred years is still better than any other song from any other artist . ... 6/10Chop Suey ! - Needs no description . Best song in the CD . Come on , admit it , when compared to John Lennon 's `` Imagine '' , of course we can argue about their opinions , but , come on , content , and tempo , and lyrical play , and everything , this song is uncomparable !!! 10/10Bounce - Funny song , sounds like some 15 year old kid wrote this , but still explosive and catchy , and will surely make you bang your head into your stereo . 6/10Forest - Confusing song . Track number 8 , also , H is the 8 letter of the alphabet . H for Hitler , and , by way of God , this may be telling someone that he is Hitler 's reincarnation , to look around , and see the results . Listen , you 'll hear the message too . `` Why ca n't you see that you are , my , child . '' Because , I 'm pretty sure Serj is n't talking to a long lost baby he had with some -LSB- woman -RSB- . Guitars are dope in this song . 8/10ATWA - Supposedly about Charles Manson ... hmmm , I do n't see , but , maybe the message is embedded in the seemingly , love-like lyrics . Not too catchy , still with more melody and better lyrically and energetically than mostof what Smashing Pumpkins made . 6/10Science - Mediocre song . Great intro , but the chorus just gets annoying . Plus , their arguments here are unfounded . Still has some wisdom , something that Puff Daddy ca n't claim to have , and sometimes the lyrics get stuck in your head . 6/10Shimmy - Raw song , very very dope . Intro is very cool . They must be talking about the public school system . I think they complain too much , if they dislike this country so much , why do n't they leave . `` Oh our economy exploits world resources ... ok got ta go , drive around in my Ferrari and watch my big screen TV , made in Japan . And to answer your question , I will NOT try to change U.S. foreign policy the only possible way , through legislative parties , I 'll just continue to -LSB- complain -RSB- about it here while plucking strings . '' But , overall , faster than anything Led Zeppelin ever made . 7/10Toxicity - Starts slow , with a the same kind of string picking that we hear in Chop Suey . Lyrics are great , and beat is excellent . They claim to `` shine light upon our hearts '' , umm , if so , I think it 's only musically . If otherwise , they have n't proven it . But , they play it on the radio for a reason , it 's a -LSB- good -RSB- song . 9/10Psycho - Starts off too , Satanically , for lack of a better word . And lyrics are boring and lack cohesion . They fail to have a catchy phrase , anywhere in this song , but their guitars kinda make up for it . If this track were to be in the Beatles 1 , it would n't be anywhere near the worst . So it 's good song , probably the best song on this CD to fall asleep to , the guitar near the end makes you sleepy . See for yourself . Just for being a hard rock song that you can still meditate too , it 's a 7/10Aerials - Very philosophical song . Gives hints of Socialism . Jean-Jacque Rousseau would agree with them here . Some lyrics do n't make sense , as what we would normally do sometimes in certain situations is viewed wrong in the lyrics of this song . They should have Psycho as the ending track , not this one . Still , great guitar riffs , and , little playing around with flutes and other stuff at the end is imitating what the Beatles did after `` Strawberry Fields Forever '' . Great song , video is stupid though . Sorry Shavo . 8/10Remember , just because I think some tracks are not perfect tens , that does n't mean it should effect the overall rating for the whole CD of 5 out of 5 . You 'll , see , get the CD , it 's a gift from God . ... Overall , the best CD out there right now . ... System Of A Down ROCKS !!!!!!!!

 SOD is definately one of the weirdest bands I have a CD to . If I may , I would like to do a breif summary of the songs .1 . Prison song 8/10 Not my favorite , but a good song . I do n't like the intro that much .2 . Needles 9/10 One of my favorites . Love the melody -LRB- especially during chorus -RRB- 3 . Deer Dance 8/10 What a weird song . LOL . Provides a good listen with unique singing .4 . 5/10 One of my least favorite songs I have ever heard . I think terrible .5 . X 10/10 LOL ! One of my favorite songs . What does it mean ?? Who cares ?? Just awsome .6 . Chop Suey 9/10 I do n't know why everyone loves this song . It 's ok , but not great .7 . Bounce 7/10 What the HECK is this song about . A pogo stick ? o. ... k. 8 . Forest 9/10 I like this song . The chorus is shuddering .9 . ATWA 10/10 At first I did n't like this song , but it grew on me . A nice slow break .10 . Science 8/10 I love this song , but dislike the message . Science has * NOT * failed this world is what it should be .11 . Shimmy 10/10 LOL . Short , funny , insane .12 . Toxicity 9/10 Another slow one , stupid lyrics .13 . Psycho 8/10 Psycho , groupie , cocaine , crazy . Pretty much sums up this song .14 . Aerials 11/10 Definately the best song . Slow , harrowing , awsome !! Overall , this cd is a good buy . I hate the lyrics which is why i give them 4/5 stars . Still , it 's definately not a waste of money : - -RRB-
 THIS CD IS PURE MEDAL GENIOUS THE WAY THEY USE THIER VOICES AND SO ON . THE SONG DEER DANCE IS THE BEST SONG ON THE ABLM TOXICITYTHIS SONG DIDNT TURN ME ON TILL THE 09/11/01 HAPPEND IT WAS THE PERFICT SONG FOR A MACRAMEDIA VIDEO THAT I DID IT REALLY SPONSERD THE EMOTION THAT WAS FELT WHILE THE ATTACKS WERE HAPPENING . THIS IS THE BEST CD AND SO IS THE FIRST . BEST OF THE BEST
 You have to give credit to system on this . They have taken the best of the last album , touched it up and thrown in a couple new twists . I recommend this album if you are looking for something different and original.Chravez , masta reviewer
 This , Mudvayne 's LD 50 , and Nirvana 's In Utero are my top fave albums.Before I start reviewing , I have something I need to get off my chest . I 'm sick of people bashing on Numetal . I mean , sure bands like Limp Bizkit and Drowning Pool bite , but most people who hate great bands like Deftones and Mudvayne and System of a Down are pretty close minded . They ca n't accept that these guys are getting more airplay than their death metal bands -LRB- Not to say that I hate Death and Black metal . In fact , I 'm a big fan of Dimmu Borgir and Cannibal Corpse -RRB- . Grudges aside , this album is superb . All the songs are great . Highlights are `` Aerials '' -LRB- My favorite track -RRB- , `` Forest '' , `` Chop Suey ! '' , `` Atwa '' , and `` Prison Song '' . All the songs are excellent though . Pick up a copy of this . You wo n't be dissapointed .
 It 's just System Of A Down . And that says more then enough .
 I have n't been a SOAD fan for very long , and I hated `` Sugar '' the first time I 've heard it . But NOW , I like every song on Toxicity and it can be memorable , though not as original as what they were known for . I love how Serj screams . And usually I do n't say that about many artists . I 'd pick this over Drowning Pool any day . This album still , however is packed with melodic songs . For instance we 've got my personal favorite , `` Deer Dance '' , and others like the title track and , well , you 'll see . This album is not like most metal , and pretty enjoyable . never heard the limited edition version , so I reviewed this . SOAD are pretty creative , one thing I 've learned . Though it may be annoying to you , `` Bounce '' is still very enjoyable.Also , the song `` X '' is a very good song that says it all about Sept. 11 . This is too good for words , and is the most enjoyable album of 2000 . No whining included in here . Probably what makes it enjoyable .
 After owning SOAD album for the last year-two , I was excited about this new relaese , I did not really know what to expect , and I have to say I was pleasently surprised . With a one or two minor letdowns.Toxicity has the regular SOAD sound , meaning
 This album is just amazing . System of a Down are definately a band we are going to hear a lot about in the not so distant future . Toxicity is quite different to their self titled debut , the music and vocals are much better , this is definately a band whom has musically matured.This is a very strong album , Serj Tankians lyrics are good but it is his vocal style which captures my attention . These songs are suprisingly catchy and Serj 's range shines out , the guitar and drum work are commendable as well.This album is definately worth picking up . The strongest tracks are `` Prison Song '' , `` Forest '' and `` Chop Suey '' . The only weak track is `` Jet Pilot '' which really is why i did not give this album 5 stars.System of a Down are definately on an up .
 This is such a good CD ! It is WAY better than their old stuff , but it 's not for everyone . If you are n't a fan of their old stuff , this CD is obviously not going to change your perspective on them . But that 's not to say that it is n't different , because it is . All the hard riffs are harder than the first album , and the mellow , complicated `` Daron-ized '' riffs are even better as well . A great example of this is `` Deer Dance , '' possibly the heaviest on the album . It is has brutal , crunching riffs that show no mercy at the beginning , but then it goes into a more groove oriented bass sliding lick , with light noting by Daron . In the middle of the song , however , it has a sweet little solo , similar to the riff from `` Sugar '' in that it is one note patterns , but it is much tastier . Here is a layout : Prison Song
 Unbelievable , magnificent , superb , the best . No matter how many words you use to describe this album no review can do it justice .1 . Prison Song 5/5 Great start to a metallic masterpiece2 . Needles 5/5 About a junkie who is addicted to herion and how it is controlling him . `` Pull the tapeworm out of your @ $ $ '' refers to the guy trying to stop his addiction .3 . Deer Dance 5/5 Beautifully heavy song .4 . Jet Piolt . 5/5 My Favourite song on the album fast and furious and brilliant , about a horse looking up to the skies and watching a jet piolt fly overhead . Might not seem like much of a good idea for a song but SOAD pull it off .5 . X 5/5 Death metal song thats too short but too fast not to be noticed .6 . Chop Suey . 5/5 About youth suicide . Great song .7 . Bounce 5/5 Wierd song , not sure but I think it may be about sex . The pogo stick is not what it seems .8 . Forest 5/5 Another great song9.ATWA . 5/5 Not sure what that stands for but this song says exactly what I think sometimes .10 . Science 5/5 Yeah hell yes ! I dont believe in science either thanks SOAD11 . Shimmy . 5/5 Another fast heavy song .12 . Toxicity . 5/5 Great song , just listen to it no words can fully capture its bliss13.Pyscho .5 / 5 GROUPIE ! COCAINE ! CRAZY ! That right there describes the song .14 . Aierials . 5/5 Awesome song , Daron says its about nothing though . So um yeh ok good song tho!Buy it Steal it Play it Love it Treasure it , SOAD dont get better than this although hypnotize came close to the brilliance of this one .
 Okay , anyone who says that this album is for whiny ten year old 's ... you 're an idiot . Look , I like 80 's and 90 's hard rock and metal as well . For 80 's heavy metal , I listen to Guns N ' Roses , Metallica , AC/DC , and Iron Maiden . I also enjoy Alice in Chains , Nirvana , Stone Temple Pilots , and any grunge band that is n't poser . -LRB- like Creed -RRB- But , it 's time to move on . No matter how great an album is , listening to the same eight to twelve songs WILL get tiring , eventually . So , shut up about how great some band twenty years ago is , and accept the fact that no band will gain that type of status in your head again . At least open yourself to other music , as you tell thirteen year olds to do . Why do n't you return the favor ? System of a Down is the greatest band that has arrived on the scene in the last decade , IMO . They are the most creative original band on the `` nu-metal '' scene . -LRB- it 's a disgrace to call them nu metal , as many people have said before me -RRB- So if you do n't like them , fine . Go listen to the Beatles or whatever . Just shut up and quit dissing bands because they formed in the past decade .
 k first of all , this aint a kids review , im 15 and i listen to soad like crazy . I 'm just too lazy to get an account . Anyways , to the people who constantly bash this cd and all soad cd 's , here some advice
 Yes , you read that right . Out of all of 2001 's albums , including Slipknot 's `` Iowa '' and Staind 's `` Break The Cycle '' -LRB- both great -RRB- , this one gets the honor of that year 's best album . Why , you ask ? Because it 's amazing . Really.The CD kicks off with `` Prison Song '' . It 's a great song with a funny stop-start intro , and the part where Serj mocks Fred Durst is hilarious . `` Needles '' is funny , catchy , and hard all at once . At one point the guitars are actually reminiscent of early Metallica . -LRB- you heard me -RRB- `` Deer Dance '' is superb , the lyrics are sweet and a great shout-along chorus . `` Jet Pilot '' is a fast , hard song that 's over before you even know what hit you . `` X '' was awesome at first , but gets old kind of fast . Next we have `` Chop Suey ! '' . Unless you were living under a rock from August 2001 to early 2002 , I probably do n't need to explain this one . Still , choice song . `` Bounce '' is probably the only mediocre song on here . `` Forest '' is just one excellent song , in the vein of `` Spiders '' from SOAD 's first LP . `` ATWA '' has kind of soft verses , then the chorus hits you and the ending leaves you wanting more . `` Science '' is quality SOAD with their famous political views . `` Shimmy '' is just a short but good song , like `` X '' . `` Toxicity '' , another single , is just a fantastic song with a great chorus . `` Psycho '' opens up with a disco-ish beat , then proceeds with singable lyrics . Very nice . Finally , there 's `` Aerials '' , which is a brilliant song.All in all , this album is most certainly an essential , and I recommend it to anyone with a CD player .
 This album is an example of creativity in modern rock music . Originality and fresh ideas are the case here . The album features the Armenian-origin quartet at their finest and is filled with energy and emotion . Go get this album now !
 The first song I heard on this album was `` Bounce , '' and to be quite honest , I was n't impressed . But I saw the CD at Best Buy , and thought , `` Why not . '' I must say it has not been something I 've regretted . This is nu-metal years ahead of any other band you will find out there , with insightful underlying political protest all the way through . But if you want an album to just rock out to ... well this is actually an amazing choice anyway . There is some amazing stuff here . Like `` Chop Suey ! '' a deeply touching/disturbing song about the unpleasant topic of suicide and `` Toxicity '' a song about the terrible disorder in the world . With the split of Rage Against the Machine , there is little possible competition for System on their way to the nu-metal top .
 All the world Ive seen before me passing by . wow . May i take a moment to say thanks for these words you sing . Today was my first time to have the pleasure of hearing song # 9 . I havent stopped since . Is it bad to listen to the same song over and over . i dont care . i could just get lost in my rage and pain thinking of all we lose each and every day . we may all be helpless in what happens in this world so accept it and let go of everything holding you back . peace
 i love system of a down and i think this cd by far out-weighs all of their other ones .
 If you hav n't heard Da system at their max , this Cd is the way to go . This CD is where Da System became famous . The highlights include `` Toxicity '' -LRB- this song rocks !!! -RRB- `` Chop Suey '' -LRB- This song will shape you into a headbanger !! -RRB- and `` Aerials '' -LRB- this song may be slower but it ends the cd with your jaws dropped and wanting the other System CD 's -RRB- You will always charish this album nomatter how old ya get . I 've had the cd for 2 years and It still is my favorite cd including my favorite songs and ARTIST !!! I love this CD and I think you will too !
 this is the heaviest cd ever I listened to it and the first words out of my mouth were this is the ... best cd ever best song is shimmy next chop suey next forest and last needles if you have every other cd you should buy this one or you 'll regret it
 After hearing Toxicity on the radio a dozen or so times , and hearing praise from my friends , I just had to pick this one up . I was n't actually expecting a whole lot , because usually what 's big amongst teens is just a fad and generally not of very high quality . System of a Down really surprised me by showing that they 're different from other bands I 've heard , and can produce some truly enjoyable music . It took about five listens , but I ended up really enjoying this album.The standouts are : Prison Song - A Rage-Against-The-Machine / Punk-Rock sounding opening tune which really gets you pumped up for the album . Sounds a bit corny at first , but you 'll get into it in no time.Needles - This is another one which , if you 're expecting all the songs to have the same sound as Toxicity , will most likely disappoint at first . However , with a few listens , you 're bound to get stuck on the catchy vocals and very nice middle-section . Deer Dance - This , along with Toxicity is one of my favorite tracks on the album . The vocals are incredibly powerful , as are the guitar riffs . I particularly like the calm , chilled middle section where the lead singer shows off his melodic voice.Chop Suey ! - As the first single for the album , played on radios everywhere , you 'll probably have heard this . It 's not all that great of a song , and it gets old after a while , but it 's very unique and catchy , with some really nice tricks that System of a Down use to make their music more enjoyable . The stop-start scheme , the heavy-then-soft feel , and the powered , melodic chorus will have you singing along in no time.Toxicity - A truly original and amazing track . The whole song-pattern here is incredibly unconventional , and takes some getting used to . The vocals will get harsh , loud and blunt at unexpected times , causing untrained listeners to feel annoyed . Honestly , when I first heard this one , I hated it . I thought that the singing was really terrible sounding , and the whole song was too hard to listen to . After a while , I came to love the song for its uniqueness . I have never heard anything like it , and if you give it a chance , you 'll love it too.Aerials - This is the most different to any other song on the album . The harsh , metal sound of the other songs is gone , along with the loud , at times obnoxious vocals . As the closing song , it really fades away nicely and lets you calm down a bit . However , it 's still very powerful , and sounds a tad like something from the Deftones or Tool.There are a number of other good songs on the album ; S.C.I.E.N.C.E. , ATWA , Forest and Jet Pilot , and then there are a few which lack the overall appeal of the rest of the album ; X , Psycho , Shimmy and Bounce -- but still are n't bad.All in all , this is better than I expected . I bought the cd with an open mind , expecting something new , but not necessarily great . What I got is a cd that is in rotation along with Radiohead
 Many bands today have ferocity and anger . American Head Charge , Slipknot , Mudvayne , Mushroomhead , Manson , etc. are among the most popular and most angry . But there are few bands that can also incorporate originality into their rage . System of a Down does this without a catch , and without selling out . As a vocalist , Serj is just ... different . It 's just a treat to listen to him because , well , the guy ca n't sing . But he does n't try . He 's simply trying to get points out about things he hates about our country . A lot of them I disagree with , as I am about as right winged conservative as you can get , and most of this band 's lyrics seem to deal with liberal garbage . However , I respect the band 's views , and I respect them as a whole , because of the fact that they are different , but they are n't trying to make an image for themselves . OOO , I 'm # 8 from Slipknot , I have rage . My mask represents my rage ! Get it ? My mask = me ? Please . And then there 's the copying Mushroomhead . OOO ... we all have the same masks , but not really cuz one guy does n't wear one and one guy wears M. Bison 's hat . Mudvayne and Manson are the same , they just do it with makeup . System of a Down is just angry , but they write great music , and do n't have to rely on make up and screaming to get a point across . The best tracks are ` Aerials ' ` Forest ' ` Toxicity ' ` Needles ' and ` Prison Song ' Get this disc . These guys are for real .
 This is my first time I 've heard SOAD . I heard `` Chop Suey '' on the radio and even had seen the video and decided to give it a try . I must say `` Toxicity '' is one of the most aggressive albums I 've heard this year -LRB- not the heaviest , Slipknot 's `` Iowa '' is heavier but worse -RRB- . This album is a very good album to work out to and to get you feeling aggressive yourself . My only complaints would be that some of the lyrics are too repetitive but that annoyance goes away after a few listens . Some of the song lyrics you just want to laugh at the way they are pulled off . Such as `` Bounce '' which talks about a Pogo stick , to make a song about a pogo stick so cool is an accomplishment in itself . `` Forest '' is another great song . `` ATWA '' is very solid , I love how the lead singer trills his R 's in the chorus . This album concludes with `` Aerials , '' a song that was put together very well and concludes with soothing mid-eastern music . I see a lot of potential with SOAD which is why I recommend this album because I think the next album will be very good , but this one is pretty close to perfect .
 This is a CLASSIC album !!! SAOD have released the joint best album of the year . Having just read some of the other 1 star `` reviews '' i have to say , you guys are fricken idiots . 1 star !!!!!!!!! Are you lot deaf , do you not appreciate good music . Well , fine.But what 's even more surprising is that you actually managed to write the review in the first place , or read any of the other reviews . This is due to your brain shrinking from listening to to much crap like creed , nickelback & N-Sync . oh ' and Limp Cookie . So due to your intelligence -LRB- or lack of -RRB- i would ` nt expect you to understand any of SOAD lyrics or any lyrics . so if you guys do write any more reviews , I will look forward to having another good laugh !!! P.S. . In case you were wondering , the other album of the year is Lateralus by Tool & Bizkit -LRB- or Biscuit -RRB- means cookie in merry old england . just in case you were confused !!!!
 After their first release it felt like we finally have the band who can deliver loud , aggressive and intelligent music . After Toxicity , it 's already a fact that no one can get these guys down from the very top . System of a Down is heavy , aggressive , theatrically sarcastic and - as something we have n't seen so far - very deep . Both their lyrics and music use their rich Armenian heritage as a creative source ... which is especially vivid in Science and Arto . If you like hard and speedy music , being at the same time sick and tired of all the commercial pretty dolls around , then you have the found the right band . This Armenian band is the truly the best in today 's rock music .
 This is how i usualy shop for cds i hear or see the video then if i like i buy the cd When i saw the video for the song chop suey i was impressed . S O A D has a metal / harmoney / guitar thing goin on and i was really feelin it . we all know how some artist have that one good song and the rest is trash . thsi is not the case here . The rest of the cd shockingly good but chop suey is still the best . The bottom line is this
 Excellent album - highly recommended . Was well worth the wait .
 As much as I enjoyed System of A down 's first effort , it took me a long time to get into this one . But I guess i 'm like that with every new cd a band comes out with . Anyway . I think that on this cd Serj shows more of his vocal ability to go really high than down to a near death metal scream in prison song , but I was disapointed that the drummer , did not do any crazy drum solos as he did on the band 's self-titled debut . All in all i really enjoyed this cd and I would highly recommend for anyone who is starting to get into metal or into System of a down . The single `` Chop Suey ! '' is definitely one of the songs where the bands demonstrates the most musical talent in my opininon . Although the sound of the song is a bit more radio-friendly than the rest of the cd , it is still a great song . Another song with great talent is the song `` Toxicity '' which has proven to become my favorite on this multi-faceted album .
 System of a Down 's s/t debut was an album that totally blew me away . It is among my top 10 fav . albums of all time . That was the year 1998 , and it has been 3 years since SOAD has blessed us with their musical goodness , and now 3 years later SOAD has dropped Toxicity . Toxicity has picked up right where s/t left off . The same unexpected time changes and death-metal-like intensity is what SOAD is all about . Serj is sounding better than ever with his distinct hardcore growls , and Daron Malakian returns as one of the industry 's most talented guitarists . Toxicity is the album of the year ... plain and simple ... nothing will top this album.Tracks of note -- Prison Song , Needles , Deer Dance , Chop Suey ! ATWA , Science , Toxicity , Psycho and Ariels
 If you 're one of the seemingly few who liked System of a Down 's self-titled debut album , you 're in luck , because they 're back . And even if you did n't really like them then , give them another chance . Their music style has shifted somewhat . They 've aged , and they 've refined their old style by adding more harmony . And yet they seem to have done this while maintaining their down and dirty , hard feel . They have definitely evolved , and are certainly deserving of recognition . Look for them to be a sleeper hit .
 this is the best album of 2001 ... amazing album a true classic
 flat out , these guys are the mesiah 's of metal . i will bleed for them ... or maybe i 'm just hittin the bong a little too often . i 'll be ok in the morning . -LSB- burp -RSB-
 This album is very good . . This one is more heavier than the first album but still manages to keep rythym going ... definitely worth ... bucks . . I ca n't wait to hear PRISON SONG Live !!!! stand out tracksprison songneedles bounceforestx
 I have had the first soad album sense it came out and i got this the day it came out . toxicity is defently different from the self title album it faster more hard core and less of darons awsome solos , and the chop suey song is the only song like that pretty much -LRB- which is a good thing cuase that is way to acoustic for soad0 the rest of the stuff is pretty good . system of a down is the future of music .
 ... buy this cd ! I found anger I never knew I had , and got it out . I was hesitant to buy this cd because I basically dispise its musical brethren , like SlipCrotch , MudLame , and the like -LRB- for their lack of variation -RRB- , yet S.o.a.D. proved to be aurally addictive after I warmed up to the machine-gun vocals . The songs , for the most part , are hard and fast , but what keeps me listening are the melodic hooks . After listening to the cd I could n't figure out -LRB- and still ca n't -RRB- why Chop Suey is on the charts , when it 's only average compared to the other tracks . SO - if you have twenty bucks to blow , you are a fan of rock , you have much pent up aggression , you have n't gone `` wigger '' like the rest , you like sbarro pizza , you want to freak your mom out , and you love the United States of America , get this cd .
 In the past 6 months I hav n't bought a better CD than this . Toxicity has it all ! From hard hitting riffs to slow and soulful melodic sounds . One of the only CD 's I can listen to back-to-back non-stop for hours ... From the decieving Prison Song intro , to the wierd but wonderful lyrical content on Psycho , this album has it all . I urge everyone to grab a copy from your nearest record store and play it loud , I assure you all , you wo n't be dissapointed !!
 Im a big RAGE fan because zack always sounded so angry but since they broke up i have to find my new favorite band and i think i found them . System of a down knows how to rock hard and he sometimes sounds angry to and i think their music has meaning just like rage . This cd is so good i would give every song 5 stars so uhh . . go buy it !!!
 these boys are on serious prozac , ritalin , or whatevernew drugs are out these days , still if you like heavy metal with crazy guys saying crazy lyrics bout god , sex , and drugs , this is for yoiu .
 I am normally not into this type of music and was attracted to this CD because of the song CHOP SUEY ! . I was very surprised to find one of the best albums I 've ever heard ! Chop Suey ! is my favorite song and I also like ATWA but the whole CD is great . From Prison Song to Toxicity this a great album . Daron and Serj 's voices combine to make a very catchy sound and although this is a metal album they have great harmonie . The bass playing and drums are incredible and the best I 've heard in a long time . I also like the message in the music . These guys rock . Do n't compare them to Slipknot , System is the better of the two bands !!!!!!
 I was very skeptical about buying Toxicity . I loved SOAD 's first alblum a lot , but I know that the second alblum is the hardest to make . Especially if you run out of ideas . I 've also came across a lot of songs by SOAD on ... -LRB- mostly lives ones -RRB- , that made me curious about what direction SOAD was taking . There 's a song with SOAD and Puff Daddy or P. Diddy , so it made me very skeptical . But I had to get Toxicity , the idea kept eating at my brain . After all SOAD is my favorite band . After listening to the alblum once it did n't leave me disappointed at all , but rather shocked . I was happy they included one of their famous songs Multiply or X in Toxicity . They play it a lot at shows . Overall there was n't one bad song on Toxicity . I loved them all and I love SOAD even more . My favorite songs would have to be Chop Suey ! , Deer Dance , Science , Atwa , Aerials , Forest and Needles . That 's almost all of the songs on Toxicity . They 're all pretty damn good . I 'm glad Daron and Shavo had more of a role in backup vocals . Anyways enough of me blabbing on and on , if you liked System Of A Down then get this alblum . You wo n't be disappointed .
 ca n't stop listening to this cd . it is great !
 I 'm 29 yrs old , i really do n't like too much of the music that comes out now calling itself metal , but these guys are the one band now that RATM has called it quits that actually give metal a good name ! The Riffs come fast and furious and the lead singers odd eclectic voice fits great ! I think this band actually has a good chance to make some huge marks in the history of rock n roll/metal in the coming releases . This is a very , very good CD , the only thing that i 'm saying is that you can definetely get the feeling that they have alot more to give to people . I love thrash , good thrash as much as anybody else , but these guys have talent that is beyond thrash . Get in on them while they are still kinda still coming up because i think their will be a day when this is the band that everybody is talking about and being played on the local stations . What the hell are you waiting for , if you like the biting guitar style that slayer is famous for then get out and buy this thing , you 'll love it . Thank you SOAD ! I thought metal was dead , and then this band proved me wrong
 One of the best cd 's ever !!!!! serj 's voice sometimes annoys me so much -LRB- when he screams -RRB- , but not to worry cuz its still a wicked cd!science is a boring trackif i were yall id take a listen to forest , ATWA , aerials , chop suey , prison song , deer dance , you wont know what its like if u dont listen to the whole cd!if u were a true soad fan u would LOVE this cd , and if u werent then listen to the cd , give it a try , who knows wat could happen after !!!!! ATWA ROCKS !!!!!!!
 I had a lot of fun listening to this cd . I thought that each song was very demanding , musical , and sometimes brutal ! Serj is the best vocalist I have ever heard , I love his accent , and Daron does a great job too . I was so psyched about getting this album , but in the process , downloaded the cd off of KaZaA already ! Overall , I hope that Toxicity or Aerials is made into a music video and hits TRL .
 I must correct myself from the last review I wrote of this item , sorry to the masses for the mistake I made . I obviously learned my lesson to research my ideas before letting them loose on the population . well , everything I said still stands , but I now know that Daron Malakian is the guitarist , and has been ever since Soil , I apologize for my remarks on how bad he is , but I still think that he is trying too hard to be noticed , I noticed his name as an interruption rather than a member of the band . sorry everyone , I will not make that mistake again . good album , I 'm liking it even more .
 System of a Down does n't happen to be very talented , but they 're very unique . They combine metal , cult , indie , asian tunes , and acoustic backups to form their band . If you like any of those kinds of music , you should try this out . I myself am more of an alternative , punkrock person , but this does it for me . Pretty much clean , except for drug abuse -LRB- Psycho -RRB- and refrences to sex -LRB- Bounce . -RRB- This may not be your cup of tea , but if you 're a rocker , you should try this one out .
 This is probably the most original recording I have heard in the past year since their self-titled debut , which might I add should not be forgotten because in it is System of a Down 's original hard rock sound . blah blah blah , do n't want to bore you guys , this CD is for those of you who are tired of buying those rock cds that all sound alike , this one is a lot more than can be summarized in the genre of rock . blah blah blah go buy it , or pirate it , whatever your thing is . and get their first cd afterwards
 Toxicity is easily one of the best releases of the year , in any genre . System of a down has taken heavy metal and interlaced it with melody and arabic influences to create an entirely new and different sound . It is heavy metal , so the faint hearted may find it a little hard to get past the sheer heaviness of the album . Daron and Serj 's lyrics are at times very direct -LRB- `` Prison Song , '' `` Deer Dance , '' and definetly `` Bounce '' -RRB- and at other times quite mysterious -LRB- `` Toxicity , '' `` Chop Suey '' -RRB- . Overall , a great album . They showed heaps of promise and their excellent but occasionally poor debut , and delivered on every sliver of it . Very highly recomended . High points on the album include `` Chop Suey ! '' , `` Prison Song , '' `` Aerials '' , and `` Shimmy . ''
 system of a down can be described as a political band - much like rage against the machine . but this album , written by a band whos known to be a little crazy , writes about everything from the U.S. prison system to pogo sticks . great melodies , especially `` Chop Suey ! '' , theyre first single from this cd . u like ANY rock ? you 'll like this
 This album is mind blowing and beyond increadable ! The album is captavating and seeing them in concert is more intense than imaginable !
 This is NOT nu metal . I repeat , this is not nu metal . This is not to be categorized with commercial creampuffs such as Limp Bizkit , Papa Roach , and Disturbed . I can not stand those bands . I almost did n't buy this CD because I feared it would sound like Godsmack . This is not nu metal . This is good intelligent brainy metal . This is heavy and brutal , yet sophisticated in the same sense . It 's a cross of Black Sabbath , The Dead Kennedy 's , Faith No More 's Angel Dust and Tool . NOT Linkin Park . Best songs are The Prison Song , Chop Suey , and Deer Dance . If you ca n't stand commercialized junk/rap metal like Crazy Town , and are in need of something real , buy this CD .
 I saw them on Pledge of a Legence Tour with Lincin Park Slipknot and Static X they were great it was head banging thrshing and also very loud I brought this album after the show and liked it but was dissapointed .
 Awsome cd ... almost evry song is worth listening to ... prison song , pogo , and chop suey are all realy good .
 What an awesome Cd ! SOAD definitly have something going for them ! And this CD really proves it . This is the best political CD I have -LRB- with RATM 's Battle for LA comin in second -RRB- . SOAD blend screaming , singing , and rapping together nicely and all the tracks are pretty good but the best would have to be track 6-Chop Suey ! , wich is slow and then gets fast , you probably have heard it playing on the radio . Anyway I highly reccomend this excellent CD to any rock fan .
 I 'm not much into speed metal , nu-metal or death metal . I like music that plays great and lyrics that make sense . After hearing Chop Suey and Toxicity , I knew I had to have this CD . Upon listening to the entire CD and comparing the lyrics and sheet music , I rated this as one of the best CD 's to come along since Rush 's Moving Pictures . As for it being catagorized as nu-metal , Amazon should replace who ever does that job . This is far from being nu-metal . It 's more of a fusion of modern metal and progressive rock , leaning more toward the later . My suggestion is to add this to your collection . You wo n't be sorry .
 I would recomend this to any system of a down fan or any rock fans , it has great songs , my 3 favorites on it are Toxicity , Chop Suey , and Prison Song .
 I love SOAD , they flippen rock!Prison song
 There 's no denying it , this album is pure 100 % beautiful !!! No , maybe not Pink Floyd `` The Wall '' beautiful , but it 's indeed an SOAD masterpiece ! This album is definately a great one , every song is awesome and well done ! Though i 'm surprised `` Forest '' was n't a hit from this album , they had it from the first song on this album.Song Reviews -LRB- to the parents , i 'll give you a small rundown on the songs to see if they 're appropriate for your kids or not -RRB- : Prison Song 5/5
 First off , I think Serj has one of the most powerful and distinctive voices in metal today , and Daron is one of the guys responsible for bringing TONE back to modern metal guitar.A few of the standout qualities here are the ULTRA catchy songwriting , the ethnic melodies , the smart lyrics , and the sense of humor that is a breath of fresh air from many other bands , metal or not.I 'm a very proud to say that this is the most FUN metal CD my collection . `` Shimmy '' your way to getting a copy .
 While System of a Down 's debut album was a decent effort , this pretty much blows it away . `` Toxicity '' is a terrific follow-up , one of the best albums of the 21st century . These guys are definitely different than most bands out there today , and they 're also one of the best . There is a lot of great stuff on offer here , such as `` Chop Suey ! '' , `` Needles '' , and my personal favorite , `` Aerials '' . There are not too many low-points , `` Jet-Pilot '' is pretty annoying but that 's about it . SOAD are one of the best numetal bands out there right now , trying their best to keep the genre alive . If you 're gon na get one System of a Down CD , make it this one . They 've yet to match this awesome album and they probably never will .
 I like all of System of a Down 's albums -LRB- except Hypnotize ; that was a mess -RRB- and this is my favorite . If you are new to SOAD , start with this because if you hate this one , you hate all SOAD .1 . Prison Song
 From the opening blast of guitar to the hushed vocals you know this is not your average nu-metal wannabe crap this is serious Serj spits lyric of over crowded prisons and general rhetoric at a speed of a jet plane and Daron squeals about smacking bitches , on paper it sounds insane . Just to prove that they can turn gibberish into a song they put on Bounce this song makes hardly any sense but it can make you smile and it 's as heavy as a blow to the head . The vocal style ranges from shout , speaking , singing and crooning Daron sings a lot more but not as much as new releases some say this good thing but Serj is the main focus which is a very good thing . My favoutite song obviously would be chop suey if it was not played so much but ATWA this song seems mellow then goes crazy like Serj is experience a fit then mellow again . I do n't really particularly care about the motives behing the songs the lyrics to me are not important its the distinctive way that they are delivered . This is intelligent music for everyone the little goth kid will like it the car salesman from woking will like it as long as he is not into dance music . A must for all collections . oh yeah the only thing I do n't like is the reference to pulling a tape worm out of your ass this is quite disturbing you know your intrigued now .
 To me their self titled album was a raw , metal masterpiece and their follow up was a great in its own right . This album is way more than the radio or MTV hits -LRB- although those songs are still great , kind of overplayed though -RRB- . The musicianship is still cutting edge , every instrument played to its expectation and Serj delivering a great vocal performance . Every song is politically charged , wacky or bizarre . Well this is my list.Prison Song - A strong opener , deals with how money is spent incarcirating drug abusers and the negative effects of fighting a pointless drug war.Needles - A strange look into the mind insanity of an addict.Deer Dance - A look into police brutallity , inspired by the G8 summit in Seatle in 1999FillerfillerChop Suey - well this song was maybe the biggest hit of their career and one of the hardest to decifer , is it about suicide and martyrdom , fear of god or an abused girl.ATWA - A ballad about Charlie Manson , so romantic yet insane.Science-A belief that science is only in for the money and offer no spiritual solution for the unexplained.Toxicity-A look into people who who sit around while the rest of the world collapses arund them.Psycho - Female fans who will do anything to get with a celebrity.Aerials-In my opinion , a song about abusing nature and not giving anything back to nature.Well there you have it a great album and a classic .
 Good album ! I liked this album alot . Good and pretty heavy to my tastes . My favorites are in the top 5 . There sinlges like `` Chop Suey '' - This song was decent , good guitars in it . And the other `` Toxicity '' , that song was just straight off the hook , drums and guitars were bangin . This whole cd is bangin , I like there whole sound on this album , System Of A Down knows how to make good tracks . Check this album out !!! My Top 5 Songs1.Prison Song2.Shimmy3.Toxicity4.Psycho5.Needles
 This is a great album by SOAD . I 've had this cd for awhile now and its great to listen to when your mad . They blend a lot of great stuff in this album . Serj 's voice is amazing . He can have a raging voice full of angst one minute , and the next have a soft , beautiful voice . This is more polished than their 1st album and the lyrics have matured and gotten better . Musicly though I 'm still convinced that their self-titled album was better . It was a lot heavier and explosive . Not to say that this album is n't . They bring out all the stuff on here . They mix raging metal with Serj 's powerful voice , to soft , lyricly amazing songs . You ca n't go wrong on this cd . The best songs are Deer Dance , Chop Suey , Science , Toxicity , Prison Song , and Forest . If you liked their 1st album you 'll like this one . Now get out there and buy this CD !!!
 I 'm going to make this short and sweet
 A cult audience gradually built for the band over the three years after their debut , and the second album exploded to # 1 , ironically enough , on 9/11 - rpecisely the kind of catastrophic event envisaged by the band - look at the liner text on the back of the first album.Some people have slammed these guys as being anti-American , but I find that really unfair . As migrants form a country which is arguably a worse place to live , they 've seen the American Dream , but also the American Reality of excessive imprisonment used merely to keept he streets safe for the elite , rather than tackling social issues -LRB- Prison Song -RRB- , pollution -LRB- Toxicity -RRB- , occasionally brutal policing -LRB- Deer Dance -RRB- and more . And of course they want ot tell the tale.Lumping this CD with nu-metal or rap-metal really irritates me . Tehse guys ar eout on their own , creating thoroughly unique music . The rhythm section is strongly influenced by Eastern and Arabic sounds , and Serj Tanaken ' voice is unusual , going from a roar to a quiver in an instant , and conveying masses of emotion.As many have said , the second half of the CD is the best . Psycho has the best slow/fast variation on the album , Science packs a real punch , Forest is the kind of thing that could give arena rock a good name , and Aerials is an astounding single . By the way , teh music on the end comes form Armenian church services - a nod to the band 's roots as Christians -LRB- though not especially believing ones -RRB- in a predominantly Muslim country -RRB- . A lot of people have bagged Jet Pilot and X , but I really found myself liking them , for a bit of a throwaway yell and roar . They do n't demonstrate how unique the band is so much , but hoe many other bands would do a tempo change like Jet Pilot 's ? Only trouble is , the first album was a better affair , with mroe solos , more innovation , more surprises and perhaps slightly better lyrics . Great though this is , it might be worth giving that one a go first .
 All 14 Tracks are good . Strange but good . Their not your normal Rock band .
 This record ca n't please everyone , that 's for sure.First , I think the musical style is really original.My favorite is `` Forest '' . There 's such a load of emotion in that song , it 's so spontaneous and desperate , I love it . `` Bounce '' is really confusing , it creates a style of its own , mixing weird harmonies with a very rhythmic flow for all instruments . `` Chop Suey '' is a more commercial song , more directed to the public , but it 's still really beautiful tough.I 'll give it 5 stars , because their lyrics are to the point . I think any society -LRB- especially that of US -RRB- is influenced by -LRB- positive as well as negative -RRB- propaganda , and sometimes it 's difficult to believe some things . These guys dare to say what they want and it 's so respectable.On the one hand , I would understand there can be some neo-nazi americans who 'd pretend that the guys deserve to go back to where they came from if they do n't like the USA . The funny bit about it is that Serj and his buddies are part of the USA too.On the other hand -LRB- and that 's pretty much my point of view -RRB- , these guys have lived and probably endured things that mid - to upper class americans wo n't ever know about.Taking into account that the latter account only for about 30 % of the population of the US , I think anyone should at least listen to what those guys have to say.I love this record . Buy it now !
 as a conservative I really liekd this cd the songs where really cool and yes they did express a liberal view of America but you ca n't just look at one side of an issue and System of A Down brought up some good points I loved Areals and the Prison Song
 Their first was good , but this is better . SOAD really improved from their debut album . Some of my favorites are Prison Song , Needles , Deer Dance , and Science . Although slow Aerials and Atwa are also some of my favorites . This cd stole my ear drums from Prison Song all the way to Aerials . Great melodies . Still as heavy as their first ... but better .
 Talented band , but people focus too much on what kind of music it is , or what other bands it sounds like . when you look at the songs , they are insightful , extreme , emotional , and tight . This band knows what they 're doing , which could be a result of massive amounts of touring , and rick rubin 's help . -LRB- but not too much -RRB- Yes this album does have `` hip-hop '' influences , but it also has some excellent guitarwork , and their extra touches of armenian music , especially at the end after aerials -LRB- what ? what is that anyway ? -RRB- anywho , the best tracks or at least the ones you should look for are forest , chop suey , and X. goojahb .
 HAHA thisis a cool cd . Its not allthat deep , but who cares . it doesnt get old , and its fun to listen to . It doesnt sound all that good unless you blast it so loud your floors shake , but when you do , ahh . . you just have to try it . Toxic City , Chop Suey , Needles , And Prision sone are probally my favroite songs on the album . I gave it a 4 cuz im an overy christan person , and dont think ` angels deserve to die ' but thats just me . You can hate me for that but i dont really care . Otherwise , this cd is awesome , i liked it more than Steel This Album .
 SOAD are so skilled and crafted in originality that they make hybrid metal and punk with a poiniant attack on politics have a new and resounding vessal.Unattainably superb the sounds this band makes are all their own . Try your best you will never begin to mistake them for another band.The title of my review only states that while being unlike thier first album this album still rocks so greatly . I myself also liked thier first album more but the highlights of this album even up and make me scream thier words in my car as I drive.I 'd love to thank Serj and the boys for making such awesome and innovative music . Bless you guys !
 For those who know System of a Down from their self titled debut this album is an all love and respects due follw-up . System offer a rich , thick and unique blend of raw talent and fast paced passion . Taking an original spin on a metal-punk -LRB- even dare I say `` carnival '' -RRB- fusion , System encourage thier listener to cast aside commercialism and purely enjoy what diffrences free-thinking can promote.System of A Down push the envelope of originality and remain a powerhouse for the future of rock music .
 Definitely artistic . Definitely inspiring . Definitely political . Although sometimes System of a Down gets a little too hardcore for me , this is an album with a vision , and political statements abound . Take `` Prison Song '' , for example , declaring that mandatory sentences -LRB- for drug offenders -RRB- be abolished and instead utilize drug treatment . Then there 's `` Toxicity '' -LRB- my personal favorite -RRB- about the condition of our cities , and how no-one can really control the world ... because the world is disorder.Now , I 'm a personal fan of melody ... and System of a Down 's songs are about an even split of melody and random screaming . I enjoy the random screaming ... as long as there 's a melody somewhere in the song . Some of the songs miss out on this and therefore ... I do n't really like them -LRB- like `` Bounce '' , for instance -RRB- . But the intelligence and artistic vision that comes with this album is definitely worth the monetary exchange .
 This album is FUNNY ! Do n't ask why just listen to it and if you have any sense of humor , you 'll be on the floor . Best song is Needles .
 I love this cd . Deerdance and chop suey has to be my favorie songs on here . I dont see how anybody dosent like this band ... I have all of their CDs including Steal This Album and i love them all but some people say that Steal this album -LSB- is bad -RSB- ... it dosent . If you like any kind of music you should like this so get it !!! I gave this album 5 stars because it is just a great band .
 This is a very good album it will go good with all of youe other rock album that u have .
 This CD introduced me to what is my 3rd Favorite band today , and it 's their best . Out of the NuMetal scene , these guys are above everyone else lyrically and musically.I say you buy this CD if you like any `` NuMetal '' band and prepare to be blown away .
 The album is good , good editing , good instrments , good everything , but I do n't like politcal lyrics . I just do n't like them . Conservative or Liberal , i just do n't think music is the proper place to air out politcal views .
 The first song i ever heard by System of a Down was Chop Suey , and at first i thought it was weird and i never took the time to listen to it , from beginning to end.Then my friend told me to listen to it , and i did , and i looked up the lyrics and i thought it was an awesome impressive song , especially to sing along . So i decided to listen to some other songs , then i heard Toxicity , and i also didnt really like it , at first , but then again i listened to it.So the weird thing is about System of a Down , is that , i never listened to this genre before , and this band is has its own genre.So after i listened to every song on the toxicity album , I became addicted to this band , I LOVED EVERY SONG ... i like all of songs , and they are ALL catchy , i would n't skip tracks on this album . Unlike other bands that only have one or two good songs.The first time i heard ATWA , i loved the chorus , and i also noticed how they can go from a sweet melodic sequence , to fast screaming , and back to melodic , which i loved . Just like in ATWA and Chop Suey . What 's really remarkable , is how the Toxicity record does seem to be more melodic then their self-titled debut , which makes it different from other artists , which mostly have rhythmic guitar . System of a Down songs are melodic , but at the same time they are n't big on guitar solos , so that is remarkable.Anyone who never liked Rock/Metal genre , has to try to actually take time to listen to some songs , they are truly remarkable.As you are listening to System of a Down , you can REALLY enjoy the guitar , and definatly the drum sequences , and just relax , and try to listen to every aspect of the song , they are very enjoyable.Every single song on this record , is excellent , but some are better , and each song , has its own mood , so this cd is good for any mood.In the same year , I got lucky enough to attend a System of a Down live concert , In Montreal on July 31 . I thought that they gave a really impressive performance , because their songs on stage sound a lot like their studio records . Which is rare , because unlike other genres , IE
 I fell in love with soad 's first album , in fact i got kinda obsses over it . The first album had awsome songs like like `` war '' , `` soil '' , suit-pee '' , `` suger '' that made their first debut an original and amazing album ... in the other hand this second realese sounds very difirent from the first . I didnt realy enjoyed it as much but then i told my self this is an awsome and actullie original nu-metal act not some cop off ... stuff like limp bizkit , linkin park , slipknot etc. . . System of a down is actullie a original band that can realy play . I gave it four starts cuz it wasnt as near as good as the first one but this still passes . Buy it !
 This is easily the best CD of 2001 . I listen to this CD 100x more than any other CD I own . My favorite song is Forest , with Deer Dance , ATWA , X , Science , and Prison Song all tied for second . Every song on this CD is excellent , not a mediocre one in the bunch ! If you do n't have this CD , buy it now !!!!!!!
 Talk about non stop energy . System Of A Down 's sophmore release , `` Toxicity '' has people talking , and talking loud . Hailed as `` one of the best albums , EVER '' by many critics , SOAD shuts down the skeptics and the critics who thought they could not top their debut album.Not only does it top the album , it blows it out of the water . Serj and he boys have really done their job here , and offer a unique brand of metal that stands out from most of the nu-metal/rapcore sludge out there.A must-have for all rock fans , `` Toxicity '' will have you pumped up for a long time .
 Although I did not hear their first album , I still can tell a good album when I hear one . I first heard Chop Suey from a friend , as he was humming it . I liked it , and then heard toxicity on the radio . Then , I knew I needed this . Toxicity has a really great guitar part , accompanied with great sounding drums . And , to show their musical ability , Toxicity is written in 12/8 Time Signature .
 This CD is bound to be a classic . The last albums I 've been able to listen to nonstop like this one are Mer de Noms by A Perfect Circle and Make Yourself by Incubus . It 's so nice to finally pick up a CD that is good music front to back with no filler.Any one of the songs on Toxicity could be hits as easily as Chop Suey ! , although that track was probably the obvious choice for Single Number One.I am a real skeptic when it comes to music -LRB- I have a band and a degree in Music , so yeah , I 'm a snob -RRB- and Toxicity truly blew me away . Not only is the recording killer , it 's just raw enough to let the performances shine through and give the entire album a sense of intimacy.BUY IT NOW !!! I have spoken ...

 There is no doubt that this album will have heads banging all over the world . If you listen to this second cd of this band -LRB- Toxicity -RRB- , you will truly understand where this generation of rock bands is going . I do n`t quite know what category this band -LRB- System Of A Down -RRB- fits into , maybe it 's Nu-metal . For me , this album is simply the best albun of 2002 . Serj Tankian with his naive and socially conscious lyrics and hypnotic weird vocal style is destined to become the Bono -LRB- U2 vocal -RRB- of Nu-metal . This Armenian album will make you hear a style of music that you will not find anywhere else . There are parts in some of the songs that are slower and then when you least expect they change into a heavy , head-banging style . I wish to see this Armenian band playing live here in So Paulo but it will take a long time , because the album has just been released . I suggest you give this cd a try , and when you find out that you love it , spread the sickness to your friends .
 I AM A FREAK ABOUT MUSIC BUT NOTHING CAN COMPARE TO THIS GREAT CD . Serj Terkians lyrics just have so much to them . the guitar riffs and . . well JUST EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS CD.I would so much recommend this cd to any of you hard rock fans out there and thats why i give it a five .
 I ca n't even put into words how much I love this album . I got it the first day it came out , in eager anticipation ... and i was amazed at how good it was . It is one of the few cds I can listen to all the way through ... and by getting the bonus cd-rom , you get an even further in-depth look at the musical talents of System of a Down . Just ... buy the album . It 's astounding .
 System of a Down 's second album Toxicity adds an entire new dimension to thrash metal popularized by bands like Slipknot , although here the Armenian-Americans blend intricate and sometimes even delicate melody with manic , unsettling heavy metal . Serj Tankian 's voice serves more of a tool to help the music rather than just an accompliment ; Tankian can change from screaming , raging vocals to whispery sing-song parts in the same way that the music changes in emotion . Toxicity could well be the Nevermind of doom thrash in the way it so masterfully adds harmonic touches to the crazed rage that their 1998 self-titled debut first demonstrated . Toxicity is truly an album to lose oneself in and be carried away with the feel of the music . Every now and then it does seem to be going on for a bit too long in places but then saves itself with another flash of brilliance , like when the hysterical chorus of X kicks in or when the psychedelic breakdown of Science suddenly kicks in . I 'm pretty sure this was the best album of 2001 , beating other works of innovation like the Strokes ' debut Is This It and even REM 's return Reveal . Almost everyone should have a copy of this , although it is is n't for the faint-hearted . If you can stand it though , be sure to turn up Toxicity very loud on the stereo .
 Ok ... this is what I think of the album : Prison Song
 This album is awesome ! I love this CD ! It 's one of my fav CDs of all-time ! Here 's my track ratings : Prison Song
 The second album SOAD is a definite sucess . It has really depicted rock , and shapen a new generation of todays music . They really are a different style , sorta like opera rock . They stand their own ground , and are sometimes very serious in some of their lyrics . Anyway , Toxicity definitely has some highs and lows , but it succeeds in all ways . Song by song review below : Prison Song 9/10 . `` Trying to build a prison , '' is kind of the main idea in this song . Typical SOAD song with tons of head bobbing rock to listen to . Solid and strict opener , great drumming , heavy guitar , and probably has the most clear sense of meaning on the CD , unless you listen to Bounce . The verses are quick , and I love at the end of them , Serj is explaining what is going on with the prison system.Needles 9/10 . The follow up does n't sound like a real SOAD song , as some people have pointed out . The lyrics are kind of confusing , but its enjoyable . I 've gave it a few more listens , and now I enjoy it a little more . Love the verses cause it is something you feel that takes no skill on the drums , but then it explodes , so no worries.Deer Dance 9/10 . Now that I listened to it a little more i like it a lot more . It took a while to get into . Really heavy and bouncy . Still gives me the same feeling about Needles . Intro is very heavy , and screaming chorus about children and applying them with guns . I love the melodic veses because it sounds really calm in a way , compared to the chorus , and the guitar riffs are awesome.Jet Pilot 6/10 . NOTHING but noise and screaming . It sounds like a total tripped out song . The lyrics make no sense , and its just a filler . Its obviously got some symbolism , because it replaces a person with a horse , which is beyond my belief , so just hit the skip button on this track . This is where the album heads downhill . The chorus sticks in your head if you listen to it a lot , which I doubt you will.X 7/10 . What do you know another filler . And guess what , it sounds exactly like Jet Pilot . Still I like it a lot more than Jet Pilot , because it is n't filled with screaming , actually I take that back , because it is probably the same . The repitiion in this song is , `` We do n't need to mulitply , '' or `` We do n't need to nullify , '' so its your choice here , skip it or not.Chop Suey ! 10/10 . Thank god . A healer . The uprise of the album . This makes up for Jet Pilot and X . It really is beautifully made . It has good lyrics , and a strong meaning . People are usually familiar with this song , but the title is really random!Fast verses which stop , then explode into craziness , then it shifts into a different tone , which is a little more calm , but then it shifts again , so you 're a little out of luck.Bounce 10/10 . I love this song . Its short and very catchy . Simple chorus too . Its kinda got a sexual meaning , which makes it funny as hell . Not a usual SOAD song , but they succeeded with a short little filler . This is a lot more enjoyable than X and Jet Pilot , because it is unlike them to make this kind of song . Two thumbs up guys!Forest 9/10 . Alright I gave it some time , and it actually turned out to be a great song . I usually need to listen to the song a couple more times to like a song I 've never heard before . It could be shortened a little bit , but other than that , you 're looking at a great song.ATWA 9/10 . Again , just like Forest , I gave this song a chance , and what do you know , its one of my favorites . The title stands for Air , Trees , Water , Animals , and it has to with Charles Manson 's activist thing . Something like that he did , and if you look in the liner notes , they give thanks to him because he was truthful about something . It is a slow song , and the verses kind of drag on , but the chorus is really good , reminds me of Forest , but a lot quicker.Science 9/10 . You know the story . Great song , although I kinda disagree with the meaning , but who cares its a cool and short song . It is heavy , but it gives me feeling that it feels like it is isolate from every other song.Shimmy 10/10 . Short little song , but it is a little too short . It flows well though , and I 'm guessing its about not enough education in some places in the world , but who knows . Verses are a flashback of Forest , just because he sings a little short part , then it goes into just a beat . In the chorus , how come when he says `` YEAH ! '' really loud it sounds like the singer from Metallica?Toxicity 10/10 . Probably one of the most stand out tracks on the album . A big hit . Thats all there is to say.Pyscho 9/10 . Would give it a 10 , but I 've heard it to much . The , `` Pyscho , Groupie , Cocaine , Crazy , '' got too annoying . Great song.Aerials 10/10 and 4/5 . Amazing closer . Not like any other song on the album . It is song you would expect to be a closer.Arto 4/5 . Sorta like an Indian , sorry I mean Native American tribal song . Its a hidden track that is in Aerials . Its a whatever song , and its not needed.Toxicity is a good album , but if the fillers were gone in would 've been better .
 This is System Of A Down 's second album and this is probably their most sucessful album to date . The reason why it was such a great album is that because the songs are well written and even if your not a nu-metal fan some of the songs any music fan can enjoy . Toxicity had some big hits like `` Chop Suey , '' `` Toxicity , '' and `` Aerials . '' Some other favorites was `` Prison Song '' and `` Needles . '' Their first album , System of a Down , was a good album but the songs on there were n't as well written or organized as this album or any other System of a Down album that follows . So all together this album rocks and System of a Down is one of the best metal bands on the market . Buy this album if you do n't have it -LRB- and buy any other album that they have ... now ! -RRB- 1 . Prison Song - 10/10 My personal favorite2 . Needles - 10/103 . Deer Dance - 8/104 . Jet Pilot - 7/105 . X - 9/106 . Chop Suey - 10/107 . Bounce - 7/108 . Forest - 8/109 . ATWA - 8/1010 . Science - 9/1011 . Shimmy - 10/1012 . Toxicity - 10/1013 . Psycho - 9/10 Psycho , groupie , cocaine , crazy14 . Aerials - 10/1015 . Arto - 7/10
 This album is just great the songs are usually very short but i can get past that cuz they are awesome . Even though he does n't have any crazy insane guitar solos Daron Malakian is still a genius guitar player that makes killer riffs . If you 've never heard SOAD before i warn you now that they are extremely wierd but extremely good .
 This album for me gives me hope that more bands like these guys pop up . As for the review that says this album is in `` some bratty ten year old 's room '' dude get a life . Maybe if you pay attention to what the songs really say you may get it . It takes an open mind to get what Serj is saying in the songs .1 . Prison Song - A great song about the prison system , corrupt police , and what the government really does with drug money . 10/102 . Needles-A song about addiction . Takes a few listens to get what it means and then you are still a bit confused .8 / 103 . Deer Dance - A classic SOAD song , with a lot of aggression and a slightly political message . They should have put this on the first album though . 7/104 . Jet Pilot - This song confused me until i found out that its about a horse longing to fly . They must have been smoking something and then wrote this song . Definitly should have been on the first album .5 / 105 . X - one of the shortest songs besides deer dance and jet pilot.this song really seemed to have no point . 3/106 . Chop Suey - One of the best SOAD songs . Its also one of the singles of this album . 10/107 . Bounce - A happy little ditty about an orgy . Gosh what were they smoking when writing some of these songs ? 8/108 . Forest - This is a good song . It means a lot of things to different people.You have to listen to it and draw your own conclusion . Love it though . 10/109 . ATWA - Sounds like a song about a breakup . Serj 's voice sounds so sorrowful and Daron 's backing vocals make the song perfect .10 / 1010 . Science - a song about science missing the most potent element of human existence . Which is Faith . love it . 10/1011 . Shimmy - Has a great message . Do n't be late for school again ! 8/1012 . Toxicity - The title track off this album . Its about the city life poisoning its inhabitants , which i take to mean is their home town of LA. . One of the best singles off the album . 10/1013 . Psycho - The only thing memorable about this song is Serj shouting `` Pyscho!Groupie!Cocaine!Crazy ! '' . 3/1014 . Aerials - The best melodiac/hard rock song out there . No other band can make a song that will even come close to it .100000 / 10All in all this album is way worth buying at any price . I do reccomen picking a copy up . get mezmerize with it because you ca n't have one without the other .
 In a decade where Metal evolved into it 's lesser form , `` Nu-Metal '' , it has been hard to find artists that break the mold of the conventional . Most rock today is either excessively hard or excessively bland , and most of the time the lyrics concern how much life sucks , how much so and so hates the world , or how the band is rebellious and hates everything . Out of this seething mass of `` Nu-Metal '' , comes System of a Down , completely their own and not afraid to have lyrics with meaning . After their self titled release , many were anxious to see how it could be topped . Lead singer Serj Tankian 's crazy vocals and the fact that their songs did n't follow the traditional mold were what made SOAD special.But on Toxicity , better production quality and even better songs topped the original by far . Every song on this album is good . That is not said lightly , or cliched . Literally every song on here is it 's own monster , from the wildly popular -LRB- `` Chop Suey '' -RRB- to the downright political -LRB- `` Prison Song '' -RRB- . Each is hard rock without being a screamfest , with crunching guitars and crazy vocals by Serj Tankian and singer/guitarist Daron Malakian , both of which are completely unique in music today . Both are truly voices that are similar to none other , and SOAD 's style is immediately recognizable . A blend of thrash and heavy metal , Armenian influences are felt throughout , by use of foreign instruments and even a chant at the very end to the beat of drums marks it as invariably unique and special.The best songs , out of the many good ones are `` Prison Song '' , `` Deer Dance '' , `` Forest '' , `` Science '' , `` Toxicity '' , and `` Aerials '' , with `` Science '' being my personal favorite . It does echo left wing sentiments , especially on `` Prison Song '' and `` Deer Dance '' , but it does not let itself become a political album by any means . The fact that they do not sing about themselves , a plague of modern music today , and focus on issues and events make the lyrics of this album very good and provocative . When coupled with the heavy guitars and amazing vocals , the meaning is really not the only thing carrying the album , and does not become too overbearing . Overall , this is one of the best albums this decade so far , and will probably be five years from now too .
 My first mistake was prejudgeing S > O > A > D . When I first heard the song Chic n st -LRB- Steal this album -RRB- I thought that they were a mess . Then , I decided to give them one more chance . I discovered my new favorite album . Toxicity was like nothing I had ever heard . My Dad even liked it ! Here are the songs :1 . Prison Song - Haedcore , crazy , funny , political , what you expect from these guys 8/102 . Needles - Possibly one of the weirdest songs I have ever heard . Some of those hot European beats and heavy to the core . 7/103 . Deer Dance - The heaviest song on the album . More noise than I like . 6/104 . Jet Piolet - Oh my god . Too much to take in . 4/105 . X - The most nderated song on the album . 8/106 . Chop Suey - Usually , I do n't like singles , but damn this one is good . 10/107 . Bounce - Something to jump around too . Fun and exciting .8 . Forest - My second favorite on the album . 10/109 . Atwa - Do n't have a clue what it 's about , but I like it . 7/1010 Science - Nice opening , butthe whole spirit takes away from the whole point of the song . 7/1o11 . Toxicity - The king of the album . Also my favorite . 20/1012 . Psyhco - Amazing . Simply amazing . 9/1013 . Aerials - O.K , mabye this is my second favorite . 11/10So in the end , this is a GREAT album . Keep on going System .
 Before I actually listened to System of a Down , the only modern rock groups I liked were Green Day and Rage Against the Machine . My best friend listens to SoaD like it 's the only thing that matters , which is how I am about 2Pac . I figured since he loves them , I 'd try it out . Holy crap , I love this band so much , I ca n't believe what I 've been missing out on . I did n't even have to listen to it a couple times to appreciate it -LRB- Like Rage 's Battle of L.A. -RRB- , it was immediately great . In the month that I started listening to it -LRB- late May 2005 -RRB- my whole life changed dramatically from other stuff , and every song on this album made more sense or was there to comfort me .1 . Prison Song -- 4/5 very political , like Rage is , so I liked that about it . The guitars and drums are great here , but they are in every song on this CD , so I 'll leave that part out of the rest of my reviews . The only reason this song got 4/5 is cuz some of the songs are FAR better .2 . Needles -- 5/5 I just started to appreciate this song about heroin , but the vocals and the way the lead singer throws his voice between hard grunts and soft emotion is amazing .3 . Deer Dance -- 5/5 starts off with funny delivery , but its message is relevant .4 . Jet Pilot -- 3/5 this is one of two songs I do n't quite get . I never skip over it , I just do n't enjoy it as much as the rest of the CD .5 . X -- 3/5 READ ABOVE6 . Chop Suey ! -- 5/5 I never heard this on the radio , but I 'll never forget the first time I heard this song and how hard it hit me because of very very close people to me .7 . Bounce -- 4/5 not significant in any way , and I usually skip over this song , but it 's fun . I enjoy it with my friends , but never alone .8 . Forest -- 5/5 this song is very poetic and it 's one of the more significant and better songs on the CD musically . Great song .9 . Atwa -- 6/5 I 'd give it more than six , but that would seem like a lame thing to do . This is one of the most amazing songs I 've ever heard , but it did n't do anything for me the first time . It was after a couple nights of crazy ups and downs that I was driving home and the song made me cry because of its significance to me .10 . Science -- 5/5 I love this song just because it 's rare to hear someone diss science blatantly . The message is so strong and so true , and the song just takes over if you listen to it loud enough .11 . Shimmy -- 4/5 another one of those kind of goofy/kind of relevant songs that I only listen to with my friends . But I love the way he says `` break of dawn , yeah ! '' The `` yeah '' sounds like the South Park creators making fun of hard rockers . Haha .12 . Toxicity -- 5/5 this is the only song I remember hearing on the radio and hearing all throughout the years to come after they stopped playing this . I could n't appreciate this song until I understood Rage , but I love the sounds of this song .13 . Psycho -- 5/5 THERE 'S A SONG ABOUT MY EX-GIRLFRIEND ! 14 . Aerials -- 5/5 this is one of the more spiritual and might I venture to say religious songs on the album . There 's no hard core rock here , just deep meaning.After it 's all said and done , and I listened to this album about three or four times , I realized how strange it was that the combination of its central themes -LRB- i.e. drugs and spirituality -RRB- works together . Alz i can say iz cop dis album , son .
 This album is a great proof of that thing that System of a down is one of the leading bands in nu-metal . The lyrics are very aggressive and rebellious . They music is also very aggressive and you can actually feel the wrath against the government . It is true that it 's very hard to listen to System of a Down more than one hour at one time because the lyrics and music are so aggressive . I like Serj Tankian 's voice in this album but also Daron Malakian can sing very well . I think these lyrics in this album are better than for example Slipknot 's because System of a Down is n't just one the groups that have come to say `` I hate everybody '' . The are a political band ... but not just political ... they have messages about all the things that happen in society . This album is much better than their debut and you can hear that their playing skills have become much better . There 's great lyrics in this album , for example Needles
 I ca n't say enough about this album . Truly a classic . Extremely ` fun ' to listen to . Yes , fun is exactly what I mean.For the other parents out there ... this album is explicit , though only a few songs on this one are ` profane ' .
 I expected to receive the album booklet/art with it , but received it in a generic case without the slightest bit of art . This was not mentioned online though the receipt with the item listed it to not have the art . Just a little disappointed that I 'll need to hunt down the booklet and back art is all . however the album itself was in great condition , and read just fine .
 System of a Down may not be as different as the Deftones are , but their second and most popular album , Toxicity , is still a fantastic album nonetheless . The lead singer and the whole band are more energetic than any other band in the world , but that 's not to praise it thoroughly . And what else , some of the songs run for under 2 minutes , and the lyrics are creative -LRB- as well as Serj 's ode to the American Prison -RRB- which definitely indicates that they are different . So , overall , Toxicity is something you 'd expect from System of a Down.Rating
 Short and sweet since everything has already been said . One of the best rock releases the past 25 years . What an album
 Much better than `` Hypnotize , '' maybe not with sales but quality , `` Toxicity '' was definitely worth the listen . A fierce rollercoaster can describe the experience with this album.The reason that I gave System of a Down 's second effort 4 stars , which is still good , is because of parts of `` Chop Suey '' and `` ATWA . '' It 's indisputable truth is that lyrics about `` self-righteous suicide '' and lyrics that speak of a religious matter that is n't correctly grasped -LRB- Chop Suey -RRB- has a negative connotation , and I do n't like to think that anything like that track was overrated ; I 'm not sure why an aspect of `` ATWA '' seemed like a dead man walking -LRB- I do n't feel/eat anymore -RRB- . Most of the rhythms on this album were exquisitely done and are fun to listen to like `` Bounce , '' `` Psycho '' and `` Deer Dance . '' Of course , weird lyrics are presented . Most of the album is fast paced , but at times , rhythms slow down.Overall , `` Toxicity '' is an intriguing masterpiece .
 Truly the best album from this amazing band . In fact , Toxicity is among my top 5 favorites because I am able to listen to the entire cd without skipping a song . If the question was whether or not to purchase this cd , I would definitely suggest to buy this particular album .
 This is for sure the best album this band has ever made and quite possibly the best ever . It 's been 8 long years since this album came out and I have n't heard anything that sounds even somewhat like it . This album combines humor and nonsense with serious political ideas and views . It is amazing because it is so radically different from anything made before then . It not only has the hits Toxicity and Chop Suey , but also the melodic Ariels , and crazy quick songs like X , Jet Pilot , and Shimmy . I JUST CA N'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS ALBUM !!!!
 THIS IS THE BETTER EXAMPLE OF HOW A BAND MAKE PROGRESS AND EVOLVE . IF YOU 'RE NEW , YOU SHOULD GIVE IT A TRY , MAYBE IT WILL TAKE YOU SOME TIME TO UNDERSTAND IT , BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT AT THE END YOU 'LL LOVE THIS ALBUM .
 If you 're into nu-metal/rock music , you should know a couple other bands like Slipknot , Sevendust , Deftones , etc. . System of A Down is just right there with those well known bands . Many listeners do n't feel like after listening to their tracks . They complain about the strange sounding verses . Once in a while there 's the freaked out verses and bridges too . At first I could n't take it , it sounded silly to me . Later after listening to their albums thoroughly , I noticed it 's not odd at all . It 's actually quite entertaining . Lyrics are all bounded by the titles of the tracks . If you do n't know , their tracks are political . Their choruses are super catchy , an average 5 year old can sing the choruses of each sound for you.I like the goofiness they give in the songs . It 's a pleasure to listen to their music.There 're a few songs I particularly like , those are radio hits too . Aerial and Chop Suey ! Great intros on both songs .
 I got System of a Down 's self-titled debut about a month ago and I LOVED IT ! At the time , it was my favorite CD of all time . I think it still is , but Toxicity comes close to beating it.Toxicity is much more commercial than their debut . If you listen to a metal or hard rock radio station , you are likely to hear Toxicity , Aerials or Chop Suey ! . That does n't make this album bad , it just kind of wares out those songs . But , the radio ca n't ruin System of a Down . My favorite band releases another winner with Toxicity.I 'll rate each song one by one on a scale of 1 to 10.1 = horrible song , deserves to be burned10 = AWESOME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1 . Prison Song - Toxicity is a lot more melodic than `` System of a Down . '' But this song is n't . Listening to this song makes you think this album is going to be like their first CD , but it 's not . This is the hardest song on the CD . And it 's the best . Although the lyrics are n't the best -LRB- They 're trying to build a prison , they 're trying to build a prison , they 're trying to build a prison , for you and me , another prison system , another prison system , another prison system , for you and me . -RRB- , the music is great and Serj Tankian -LRB- vocals for SOAD -RRB- sings fast and great . Necessity.Rating
 AND BUY THIS CD !! It 's one of those moments in time that everyone refers to , a time when everything stands still for something great to happen . This CD is perfection . It 's a revolution . Every song is excellent . Every song is a new adventure . The political awareness and straight up ferocity it brings with a very tight production quality make it an absolute standout . Oh , it 's not for the uptight , or those sensative to loud noises.Maybe no one else should buy it ? That way they wo n't get complacent like some other bands and release meaningless carp for the masses . Yeah , DO N'T buy this CD . I 'd rather keep this band all to myself . I hear Britney has released a greatest hits CD , you definately should give that a look . Now . Go ! Search for it !
 I really think people ought to broaden their minds , for this is possibly the best SOAD album yet . Every single song was awesome on music , and the lyrics as well , Serj did an exremely awesome job on the vocals , Daron is an awesome guitarist , who was either thrashing on full volume , or making a melody , John 's drumming skills are very awesome indeed , and Shavo was superb on the bass , escpescially on `` Science '' . Sure the lyrics may sound fast and riff-raffy , but they do have a point . For instance , `` Prison Song '' is very true , our government keeps many secrets from us , and increases the costs of crimes . `` Aerials '' was touching to me , very melodic , and the Armenian bit at the end was very emotional.Overall , I give this album a 11 out of 10 . This album deserved it , and really introduced the world to System Of A Down .
 What I find quite hilarious is the fact that you think Rick Rubin is System of a Down 's producer -LRB- in regards to your Slipknot review -RRB- . Sure he produced their albums , but he has been producing bands since the 80 's , such as Slayer , Beasty Boys , Red Hot Chili Peppers , and many many more.Get your facts strait.As for this album , I love it.I think its brilliant.I dont think there is one weak track in this whole album.Needles being my favorite.A must buy .
 My previous reviews were deleted I guess because of arguing with that ignorant so and so KarlMarx , so I better re-do my review more politely.Let me tell you about System of a Down ladies & gentlemen , SOAD is the most creative , original , exciting band in music right now . Daron Malakian is an incredible song writer , he is the talent of this band , this guy seems to have a talent of thinking up radical ideas for songs in his head but then actually getting them to work and putting them on record . For example lets take the song `` Chop Suey '' , this is a perfect example to sum up SOAD in 3 minutes , because this song takes you on a complete rollercoaster of a ride -LRB- in just 3.30 mins -RRB- , its an amazing whirlwind of time changes , differing emotions & radical musical textures . This is the kind of song most of us will struggle to think up in our heads , no matter how imaginative you may be , but to mould a song out of what you think up in your head is the hard part , but Malakian does it . `` Chop Suey '' is a relatively short song , but its also an EPIC , it has the swift brutality of a punk rock classic yet it also has the complexity & variation of a 9 minute prog rock track . Genius . From the opening spine tingling acoustic strum , to the chaotic , agressive midpoint , to the intense emotional balladry of the outro , this is 3 and a half minutes of pure genius . Just take a look at the writing credits on this album and you will see who runs the show in this band ... its Daron Malakian.He 's not the only talent in the band however , Serj Tankian is an amazing vocalist , best displayed on `` Aerials '' here he shows his awesome vocal range . Complete with John Dolymayan 's incredibly powerful drumming & Rick Rubin 's , as always , stellar production work you have the best rock album in years.And to all those who say System are sell outs & that they are mainstream rubbish let me tell you how it is , the reason SOAD sell a lot of records and this album debuted at # 1 on the US album charts -LRB- on the morning of 9/11 -RRB- is because whatever you may think about the state of the music industry , there is still a market for real music , there is a huge fan base for cutting edge music like this , this is why SOAD sell a lot , not because they are mainstream or MTV driven , but because people are sick of that kind of stuff and want real music , here is where SOAD step in , so do n't call them mainstream garbage because their music is n't mainstream , their music is intelligent , challenging and as raw as you can get , how many millions it sells is irrelevant.Now for my ratings : Prison Song
 This CD is great . The band is made up of Daron who is a great guitar player , Shavo a good bass player , Serj a amazing singer/song writer , and John who is an exceptional drummer . This CD has most of System of a Down 's good songs like Pshyco , Chop Suey , Toxcicity , and The Prison Song . I actually cant think of a bad song on the whole CD . Soad is very unigue . There isnt a band out there that can match Soads unigue style and sound . There is absolutely nothing like System of a Down . Once you hear some SOAD music you will be singing it for days or even weeks . System of a Down even touches on political content . Their music is meaningfull . They arent just one of those bands that go out there and just scream about nothing . They are amazing . This is a MUST BUY for anybody that likes hard rock or metal !
 This CD is great . If you like hard rock then this CD is for you . The band is made up of Daron who is a great guitar player , Shavo a good bass player , Serj who is an amazing singer and song writer and John who is an exceptional drummer . It has most of SOAD 's best songs like chop suey , pshyco , toxcicity , the prison song and more . I actually cant think of a bad song thats on this CD . The music of SOAD is unigue and even touches on political content . There music actully is meaningfull there not just one of those bands who go out there and scream about anything like the typical metal or hard rock band . Also there is no band out there who can match the unigue sound of SOAD . They sound so different then anyone else out there . This is a Must Buy for rock fans !
 I 've been involved with music all of my life . Since I can remember , my father blazed Sabbath and Ozzy from the stereo . I remember the big-hair bands of the 80 's and the grunge bands of the 90 's . Exceptional bands have always been far and few between.People like the Oz-man , who actually orchestrate their music . Not only do the lyrics mean something , but the music has more than 3 chords.SOAD brings just that to the table . The music is thick ... very thick . It 's stuff kids can still bang their heads to , but for the real listeners , you can hear some stuff going on . The lyrics ... at first glance might seem like your average B.S. not so . Theres a real message to what 's being said . Plus I love the switch-up between melodies . good stuff .
 System of a down is shorly what i call true rock . Theres is no comparison to slipnot . Thers a REASON i admire these songs for they have true Quality in the voises -LSB- lead singer -RSB- the tranquilty of the sounds i here evry day on my computer are the joy of system of a down . My favorite song -LSB- s -RSB- in this albom are TOXICTY , aRIALS , SHIMMY , PYHCO , AND THE PRISON SONG . If you love rock and has not bloody bort this CD THEN WERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN SINCE 1998 THAT WAS THE 1 ALBOM . I shall inform you that if you find live performences the singer is gon na be out of tune . TRUST ME -LRB- ... -RRB-
 This album has got to be my favorurite album in the world - from my favourite band in the world . They absolutely rock , the music has great lyrics and meaningful music . Recommend it if you like Linkin Park and Slipknot !
 Well I presumed nothing would top System 's self depute album ... I was wongs . ` Toxicity ' is THE BEST heavy/rock album I have ever listened . Tracks such as ATWA and X touch an more of a sensitive side of the band , but dont worry , they keep their natural stile of playing in every track . Other tracks such as ` Arto ' remind us where the band had originated from , Armenia with the insturment used ` doodook ' -LRB- also originated from Armenia -RRB- . This is very commendable for a foreign band to I 'd recomend this album to anyone that appreciates good music .
 System of a down prove with this album why they are a true rock band . Rock is about being loud and creative and thats what Sytem do so well . System of a down have their own unique style and it rocks . Serj 's vocals are prettier at points than on their self-titled debut and this really works to offset the harder music . Beautiful music . Rick Rubin scores again as producer .
 I got the CD the morning it came out and i have to say that its really good.System Of A Down is truly one amazing band.i ca n't wait for their next album !
 The new System of a down cd is great carring over the same lyrical style of the first album but the music is much harder and packs an even more powerful punch . The musical work and devolpoed lyrics make this cd a definate best release of the year . Make sure to buy the limeted edition with the bonusd footage . All in all a great cd and definatly worth the buy .
 Wow . It 's hard for me to say this but anyone with any taste in music should enjoy this album . Essentially it invokes the same mind jarring reaction all of us had to the previous album
 This cd is fantastic SOAD . The whole thing is pure rage . If you like their first album get this . Have n't stopped listening for over a week -LRB- got an `` advance '' copy -RRB-
 I am new to the System of a Down experience and loving every moment of it ! I just bought the cd and from what I heard in the car on my way to work , IT ROCKS ! Chop Suey is great and the video is a perfect accent to the song . I look forward to a live tour .
 System of a Down 's Toxicity is everything I expected from them - and more . This album 's sound is generally tighter than that of the self-titled release . Also , there is a palpable sense of growth within the music . System has obviously been hitting their instruments , fine-tuning their unique sound.The vocals are not only as frantic and hectic as before at some points , but also poignant and sweeping at others . The lyrics on this release also seem to make a bit more sense than those of the self-titled album . The guitars are just as shattering as ever , but with more melody . Also audible on the album is a wide range of different percussion instruments . This is all indicative of System of a Down 's ability and willingness to experiment to create new sounds.All in all , System of a Down 's Toxicity is worth every penny I paid for it . People who liked the self-titled CD will enjoy being able to compare Toxicity to previous System of a Down works . Kudos to the band for focusing their immense creative energy into such an exciting and uplifting package .
 I completely avoided this thing when it first came out , but somehow it still ended up in my collection not long after it 's release . AND while I am a moderate , but not entirely big fan of this band as a whole , I have to say that this album right here will be deemed one day as a classic , and I would say it is one of , if not THE best rock records to come out of this decade.Although the album is politically driven , most of these songs can be used to mirror whatever is going on in your current mind -LRB- something that other lyrical geniuses of the past have accomplished for us -RRB- and really takes some serious issues for a wild spin -LRB- or a good old fashioned ride on the pogo stick ! -RRB- This album got me listening to the radio again in 2001 after being away for some years -LRB- I would soon leave again , as there was n't really much shaking otherwise then either -RRB- But I played the hell out of this album when I first picked it up . There is a perfect bond here between ballads , sweet stringy melodies , and heavy in your face riffs and power chords . And vocals that are n't to far over the top that it hurts , but just enough to get you in touch with your mentally ill side.I always just played this one from start to finish , and never asked questions . If you have not yet given this album a spin , you seriously should do so .
 Being the devoted metalhead that I ` am today , I 'll honestly say that I 'm not a big fan of nu metal whatsover . Normally I 'm a huge fan of death metal bands such as Deicide , Death , Morbid Angel , Nile , Krisiun , Suffocation , Cannibal Corpse , Malevolent Creation , and thrash metal bands such as Slayer , Testament , Kreator , Sepultura , Anthrax , Exodus , Overkill , Megadeth , and so forth . However System of a Down are one of the better nu metal bands out there , heck I would n't even consider these guys as nu metal -LRB- I would consider them as hard rock or alternative metal -RRB- because they are very good at what they do , and they do it a whole lot better than all of the other crappy nu bands out there . Their 2001 masterpiece Toxicity is just an incredible mindblowing album . While not as good as their 1998 self titled debut , but this album is pure gold nonetheless . I mean this is one of those albums along with `` Vulgar Display of Power '' by Pantera , `` Reign in Blood '' by Slayer , `` Beneath the Remains '' by Sepultura , and so forth that I can just listen to over and over again and never ever get tired of it no matter how many times I listen to it . Producer Rick Rubin does a fantastic job with producing this album . What separates SOAD from most god awful nu metal bands are two things
 I 'm obviously going to give SOAD a five star review or whatever because they are one of my favourite bands . So I 'm surfing through the reviews when I find some 1 star reviews that trash this album to bits and pieces and then decided to be all triumphante and `` helpful '' by giving listing some `` worthier '' bands . who are they to imply that only the bands and artists they like are the right kind of music ? They do n't have the right . Music is something very valuable that connects with people and even if a song only connects with 1 person that makes it special and does n't deserve to be critized . What some people do n't realize is that music is taste . Certain people like certain music . Everyone 's taste in music is different and should be respected . I mean would n't you be pissed if someone said really awful about your music ? Anyways , its good to have opinions but being overly judgement and mean is a different thing . If u buy an album and do n't like it then I do n't see the point in reviewing it if you 're not an eudcated expert , and if you are one then why the heck are you posting reviews on this site ?
 Soad is the best . john is the best . daron is the best . serj is the best . and yes shavo is the best . this cd is awsome along with all of their cd 's . i suggest buying them all now .
 We 're living in a time where bands will go with the flow , and just do what the people want . It 's once in a million when a band does n't care about everyone else , and makes the music they want ... and it 's this music that people enjoy more . The most obvious examples
 Ironically first issued on September 11 -LRB- it 's just been given a worldwide release -RRB- , System of a Down 's second release received major props from numerous critics for allowing hundreds of Americans to vent their frustrations and anger through music - and not just any music , but intelligent music . The album , like the group 's self-titled first release , puts together an unlikely combination of nu-metal and politics , making the tracks not only enjoyable , but also fascinating in a JFK kind of way . A tune like opener `` Prison Song '' hears their conspiracies of the American prison system , with the unbelievable riffs and hard-as-hell guitars included only heightening the track . But their not only about politics , they let loose on `` Bounce '' , virtually taking punk lyrics and putting them in a metal situation , with the song revolving around a pogo stick . Their quick changes between deep meanings and light fluff make the band feel like Metallica at their best , mixing the alt-rock sensibilities of Load and the hard nature of Master of Puppets . They excel on nearly every track , with hit single `` Chop Suey ! '' practically redefining what metal can be like . An incredible opening is accentuated by lead singer Serj Tankian 's soaring voice , sounding like an anarchistic rocker one minute and a choir boy the next , with guitarist Daron Malakian hitting every note with perfection . In a year filled with nu-metal acts , Toxicity triumphs , leaving the majority to rot in their `` We hate the world so we 'll scream about it '' attitudes . More original than Korn , more tolerable than Limp Bizkit , not as freakish as Slipknot and hundreds times better than Creed , System of a Down have taken the mantle from At The Drive-In as the coolest hardcore band in the world .
 I greatly anticipated this cd for a long time and that wait was justified . Their first cd was very good , but this one is a whole lot better . This one has more of a diversity . It has singing , screaming and some great guitar and drums , which all blend together masterfully . Serj has a great voice , no one can go from screaming to singing to whispering and back like he can.They are unique and no one else is like them . The best song is Chop Suey , it is better than Sugar . Others that are good
 * Any four star rating given by me is a good rating , for my four stars would be someone elses five . Just clarifying . Thanks . =-RRB- If needed , I will do a follow-up review.This album has a definitely different feeling from their dynamite debut . Taking two steps forward in the field of creativity and diversity , they take a step back with a few mediocre songs on this album . Where as the last album kept me exited and attentive througout , I find myself skipping through parts of this CD to get to the greater contents . But none of the songs on this CD are bad at all in my oppinion.But some of the songs are truely phenominal ! The hit `` Chop Suey '' is a great song with great lyrics . It 's eclectic variety of instruments and styles is great . Strings , piano , hardcore , punk , acoustic guitar ... it 's all there ! Great melody , too.The first song , Prison Song , is a great political song with many movements.If you 're looking for something reflects System 's sound on the last CD , look to the song `` Shimmy '' for a hard hitting , fun loving song.Last but definately not least , `` Aerials '' , the last song on this disk , is a phenominal song that is musically and lyricaly beautiful in my ears , and at the end takes a very musicaly suprising and beautiful turn ! If you are getting or already have the CD , you 'll know what mean ... This CD has it 's Flaws , but it great for the most part . It was worth the money for me . Maybe it is for you , too .
 This is a great sophomore album , but it 's not really as spectacular as the self-titled first album . I mean , the lyrics are still significant , and the music still heavy and enlightening , but there does seem to be a bit repetition that goes on in some of these songs . And unlike the first album , the second half of the songs do seem to get tiring afterwards . But still , I admire SOAD and I admire this album . The best songs have to be `` Aerials , '' `` Bounce , '' `` Psycho , '' `` Prison , '' and `` Chop Suey . '' Still , not their greatest album , but it still a likable effort .
 It might just be ! That means a hell of alot too . It 's a shame that that this band is labled ` nu-metal ' , becuase honestly , this is the most punk rock thing I 've heard in a while . Hell , even the singer makes me think of good ol' Jello . I 'm not a big fan of radio suppourt but this band diserves it . Some of the best lyrics in mainstream rock.Thumbs up
 I LUV this band and these songs . My friend introduced me to this band , and after the first song i as absoloutely hooked . Wierd enough for kids , loud enough for teens , and heavy enough for adults , this cd will make anyone who listnes to it absoloutley LOVE it . There are a few songs that are a bit `` bad '' shall we say -LRB- some pretty heavy swearing -RRB- , but the rest of the songs are absoloutely wonderful .
 Toxicity burns away at your ears until it reaches into your skull and makes you realize just how -LRB- expletive deleted -RRB- good it is . From the first track you realize your ' e dealing with much more than anything else that 's being offered in the metal scene today . The pulse of the music along with Serj Tankian 's scowl makes for instantly gratifying music to move to and the lyrics certainly make you think a hell a lot more than anything bands like Drowning Pool or Slipknot have been putting out . Although I do enjoy Slipknot 's brand of metal -LRB- I 'm not a fan of Drowning Pool -RRB- , SoaD bring the element of true substance into there music much more with the words that have been penned by Tankian . The entire album never falters from this incredible starting point , but does change into some incredibly melodic territory in a few songs , showing off the entire band 's musicianship ; along with guitarist Daron Malakian 's ear for a great song , as he writes most of the music on the record . On an album this good it 's very hard to pick favorite tracks , especially when some of the best go right into other songs . This is another credit to Malakian who co-produced the record with legendary producer Rick Rubin -LRB- if you have any thoughts of Rubin that do n't involve the tag of legendary , check out Metallica 's self titled album , the Beastie Boys-Licensed To Ill , and the still new , already classic Red Hot Chili Peppers-Californication -RRB- . But I will add that I believe my personal favorites on the album are `` Deer Dance '' and `` Chop Suey ! '' . I became a fan of SoaD as soon as I heard their first record , but this one is already showing how much they 've improved with the touring that followed that sick debut . To end I will just say that in a time when heavy music is all about angry white boys who 've got their hands on some turntables -LRB- which is n't a bad thing , but overkill is overkill -RRB- , and the puddles of -LRB- expletive deleted -RRB- that they are putting out it 's nice to see that System of a Down is there to tell people what they should really be angry about . Buy this record , see SoaD live , support music that means something.P.S . I 'm not one to give out 5 star reviews for any record i just `` like '' , so trust me on this one .
 I am turned off by the few `` punkish '' sections in a couple songs -LRB- i.e. jet pilot -RRB- . I do n't why soad feels the need to have these , especially when they obviously are extremely talented . And they have proven they can be really heavy w/o sounding so brash . But otherwise I think its excellent . Aerials , Psycho , and ATWA really blow me away . They 're definately one of the most talented metal bands today .
 If their first album was n't good enough for you ... which I do n't see how it could n't be ... You should look into getting this album , with the poetic writings of Serj Tankian , and with the melodic Bass and Lead Guitars , mixed with the rythmic drums , this is n't an album to miss !
 Let me start off by saying that SOAD 's debut blew my friggin mind . It was the freshest most original release to come out in a good many years and is still one of my favorite albums of all time . Now as most bands seem to disappoint me after their first album -LRB- ie . Staind , Incubus , Limp Bizkit ... -RRB- I was a little hesitant about the new SOAD , but I bought it anyway . BR > This new album surpasses anything they 've done . Everything about this album is awesome . Lyrics , music , vocals , production ... EVERYTHING ! The vocals are some of the best you 'll hear . I ca n't say enough good things about this album . There is one bad thing about it , though ... It 's too darn short !
 Wow , I am speechless after hearing this album . This cd has very good lyrics and ausome riffs . it is the best .
 The origin of System of a Down was a big hit when it came out , including the smash hit songs spiders , surgar , and war . Now , their new album TOXICITY is gon na be another smash hit . They did alot of changes in their music , including the new smash hit `` chop suey ! '' which is a great song . They done alot of new interesting lyrics and awsome tones in their songs . This album is excellent .
 Ok first thing is first , this album ROCKS !!!!! It carries the same intensity Lyrical talent and musical craziness as the self-titled . In my opinion this is one of the top three most anticipated albums , along with Slipknot 's `` IOWA '' Tool 's `` Lateralus '' and Slayer 's `` God Hates Us All '' . One of these will undeniably be album of the year . Best songs on Toxicity
 This may have been the most anticipated album of the year for me . I loved System of a Down 's self-titled album . It is one of my favourite albums of the last couple of years . I was n't expecting to get a sophmore effort that could match their debut , and truthfully , I did n't . Serj 's vocals are still just as amazing . He patterns himself perfectly around the best vocalist in the history of rock music , Mike Patton . His vocals on `` Forest '' perfectly display his amazing range and dexterity . Shavo 's bass licks work well with his counterparts , Daron Malakian , heavy guitar riffs . My complaint is Darons guitar work . Although he used 12 tracks of guitar -LRB- only two on the debut -RRB- they seem much more repetitive then they were on the debut . Still , I think he is a talented guitarist . The main riff of `` Science '' sounds like something that would come out of a 70s metal album . One of the highlights of the disc in my opinion is John 's drumming . I feel he has solidified himself as one of the better metal drummers of the new millenium . John displays a great knowledge of the art of drumming with the most complex time signature 's one will ever hear from a new millenium metal band . Lyrically , this album also posesses some gems . `` Science '' , `` Deer Dance '' , and `` Prison Song '' are all filled with terrific , thought provoking lyrics . Although I think self-titled was better ; System of a Down have still passed the painful test of the sophmore effort with flying colors .
 This album is even more amazing than the last album . If you liked `` System of a Down '' at all , pick up `` Toxicity '' . All the songs here are awesome . They are both heavier and more beautiful than the songs on the last album . And all those anoying voice cracks of Serj are gone in this album . It rocks !
 I just got into System of a Down after hearing a song on the radio . So I thought I 'd check em out and bought this cd and its amazing . The guitars and unique vocals make for a great sound . This cd is a great buy and worth your money
 THATS WHAT THEY 'RE STYLE IS FROM WHAT IM HEARINGWHICH IS COOL , WHO DOES A SYLE LIKE THAT?AREALS IS A NICE TUNEAND `` CHOP SUEY '' MY FAVORITE EVEN THOUGH IT SOUNDD DEMONIC ANDANGEL BASHING BUT I REALLY HOPE THESE GUYS ARE NOT `` DEVIL WORSHIPERS `` BUT ITS HARD NOT TO LISTEN TO THIER MUSICBECAUSE OF THE LEAD SINGER 'S `` AWESOME VOICE '' ! HE CAN REALLYBELT OUT THE NOTES AND I LOVE WHEN THEY ALL HARMONIZE TOGETHER!LOVE OR HATE EM YOUR GOING TO BE SING ONE OF THEIR SONGS IN YOURHEAD WITHOUT A CHOICE THEY SOUND JUST THAT GOOD ... SORRY.ANYWAY GOOD BUY .
 this cd was phenominal ! it was the first cd i got of soad and now i have all of them . It is hard to top their first cd they put out but they did . My favorite songs are Prison Song Needles Deer Dance Jet Piolet X Chop Suey ! Bounce Forest Atwa Science Shimmy Toxicity Psycho and Ariels . If you notice , that is every single song on the album . I just thought it was that good.Prison Song - This was one of their more political songs . Very fast , and shows Serjs talented voice in it . I loved this song ! 10/10Needles - WHAT AN AMAZING SONG ! I loved the part when daron sang his part . That was funny and random . One of their best songs they 've made-10 / 10Deer Dance - Another political song and very good . Very heavy and just overall good . 9.5 / 10Jet Piolet - This song is pretty good but not thier best . I still loved it . Its super fast and an interesting song . 8/10X - Another political song and fast again . Kinda like Jet Piolet but Shorter . Would be higher if a little longer . 8/10Chop Suey - JUSt an amazing song . I love how it is so fast paced and the fast singing . I dont really get why it is called chop suey though . 10/10Bounce - Fun song and i love the beat . The beginngin of it is just the best ! 9/10Forest - Awsome song !

 This cd was not thier best but it did have some hard hitting lyrics . If I was you I would still buy it .
 i 'm a new soad fan . i usually listen to bands like Metallica , Black Sabbath , Led Zeppelin , and I always had this feeling SOAD and Korn are just about in the same league , and never bothered to listen to any of their songs , till i stumbled upon Violent Pornography off their latest album . Then I listen to Toxicity album , and i was in for a treat . System of a Dawn is not your usual Korn-like band . When I dug a little deeper , I found out what these guys are all about , and their music is trying to send a totally different message than a shallow listener might think . Not to ignore the musical bit , they have more melody in their songs than I 'd ever expected.Prison Song - good opener , like the song very much , catchyNeedles - not a song you enjoy hearing it for the first time , but it has a certain amtosphere ; not to be ignoredDeer Dance - one of my favorite off this album , powerfull , good bass line , good lyrics , and very very catchy : -RRB- Jet Pilot - do n't like it , too violent without any substance . Repeting riffs . I jumped every 20 seconds of it , and it 's pretty much the same thing all the way throughX - think this was actually a album-filler songChop Suey - great guitar work , but i find it too loud and fast compared to the chorus . could have kept it a bit more melodicBounce - pretty short and energeticForest - favorite song , good guitar work , strong lyricsATWA - melancholic , with a good certain edge to itScience - it 's motive for bein on the album it eludes me to some extentShimmy - too repetitive , yet I like it , it breaths energy : -RRB- Toxicity - good guitar , good lyrics , complex , atmospheric , great songPsycho - very good song , a good balance between message and music , beat and melodyAerials - could call it comercial , I just find it awsome , the vocals on it are great
 Not only did the entire cd captivate me , but the intro contained the initial attraction . I actually dig the lyrics more than the music
 I am a thirty-six year old female , and never thought I will love rock . . But I must admitt I was wrong ... I love these guys.Toxicity is awesome ! Love youSerj
 To start , I would like to point out that I do n't really care for a lot of hard rock with growling such as this . I applaud System of a Down -LRB- I 'll call them SD from now on -RRB- for making them enjoy it . Some songs are more hardcore while there are a couple soft songs . I like this CD a lot .1 . The Prison Song
 Prison Song-Just a song about prisons and drugs and stuff , weird , but a good opener.Needles-This is a crazy song . Very heavy . Like their first album , they are continuing to not make sense . The whole band sounds very into this song . I just realized that this album is different , there is no f-word at all so far.Deer Dance-Light vocals over crazy melodies and getting heavy again . System of a Down 's lyrics are starting to get political and make more sense.Jet Pilot-WHY WERE THE EYES OF A HORSE ON A JET PILOT ? This whole song seems pretty drug-influenced , and could have been on the first album.X-Daron rips the intro to this song , then the whole band goes into heaviness . More classic , nonsensical SOAD.Chop Suey ! - Despite the random title , this song actually makes sense and is a good song to listen to you if you are feeling down , and it is surprisingly a very sad song for SOAD . Quoting Jack Black `` It sounds f-ing important that angels deserve to die ! It 's about nothing . '' It actually sounds like it 's about someone being depressed after breaking up and the ending is very melodic.Bounce-Now we get back into heaviness . This song is about sex i think . Or it is about `` Pogo Sticks '' . Hey who knows , right?Forest - This song gets a little lighter , and is generally following the theme of more melodic , cleaner SOAD , but still follows the the theme of nonsense combined with political statements . This album was released a week before 9-11 , so it is mostly criticizing pre-9-11 America.ATWA-So now there is more melodic slowness . Way more than on their first album . You can tell Serj had a breakup before recording this album . They like the theme of going slow to hard.Science-Yet another great intro courtesy of Daron Malakian . Just about what it sounds like . Some random noise in the bridge . This album has a lot less guitar work.Shimmy-A pretty random song that sounds like it could have been on the first album . It 's true purpose is to lead up to the next album . Do n't be late for school again.Toxicity-This is the theme song of the album . It 's whole purpose is to bring System of a Down 's craziness to the mainstream and it suceeded . The lyrics are just about modern life through SOAD 's eyes , so they make no sense . The chorus is insanely fun and crazy and helped this song become a mainstream song . If your just looking for a good metal album , buy Toxicity just for this song , because it is a classic.Psycho-This starts out really weird , probably for SOAD to get away from the mainstreamness of Toxicity . This song has four words to describe it . Psycho ! Groupie ! Cocaine ! Crazy ! Makes You High ! Wonder if this is the same chick from Chop Suey ! and ATWA.Aerials-A pretty good song to finish off the very good , although somethimes shaky , album
 this is the cd that made system of a down as big as they are . all the songs are pretty good , the lyrics are very weird and sometimes dont make much if any sense on some songs , but this is what ive come to expect from SOAD and thats what makes them different form every other rock band out there . the guitar playing and drumming are great . they go really well with Serj 's singing . i guess ill do one of the song listings too :1 . prison song 10/10 - great opener , heavy , political lyrics2 . needles 8/10 - kind of a gross topic , makes you think3 . deer dance 8/10 - good song but kind of repetitive of the first two songs4 . jet pilot 9/10 - fast song , i used to hate it , but i like it a lot more now , lyrics are repetitive and dont make any sense , classic SOAD5 . X 8/10 - almost like a part two of jet pilot , repetitive lyrics and fast6 . chop suey ! 10/10 - this is the first song i heard from these guys and its the one that got me hooked , calm at first , then gets faster and heavier , `` angels deserve to die `` 7 . bounce 2/10 - i know the wierd things that SOAD sings about but this is just stupid , a song about a pogo stick , a little like jet pilot but that song is better .8 . forest 7/10 - good song , i get this and ATWA messed up a lot9 . ATWA 10/10 - good lyrics on this one , one of my favorites on the cd10 . science 8/10 - i get this song stuck in my head all the time , political lyrics ... i think11 . toxicity 9/10 - 2nd single i think , `` spitting seeds as a pastime acitivity '' , i love the end of this song12 . shimmy 8/10 - i love this song , its got the coolest riff in it and the lyrics are pretty sweet , too short though13 . psycho 7/10 - a song about someone who does drugs , its grown on me a lot , they shouldve taken a minute off this and put it on shimmy though14 . ariels 7/10 - last single off this cd , i dont get it at all but its still pretty good . its got some of their cultural music at the end which is pretty cooltop 5 favorites
 I find that System of a Down , through all three of their albums released to date , are an amazing band . This one stands out interestingly amongst the other two , as well , as it actually sounds different . Granted , their self-titled debut and Steal This Album are amazing , and both deserve 5 star ratings on their own . However , Toxicity oddly has its own sounds to it that , although System , sound as if it were something dreamed up by a completely different group of artists from the Middle East , and then given a hard-rock edge.And please , this message is to all reviewers
 Edgy , driving music , I say . This is my first -LRB- and as of now , only -RRB- SOAD experience , and I must say it gets me going each time I listen to it . I 'm not exactly sure what `` nu-metal '' means -LRB- Linkin Park and SOAD being the only two bands that I know of who classify as such -RRB- , but if Toxicity exemplifies the nu-metal sound , I 'll certainly be looking for more of it in the future.Basically , it 's extremely well-produced -LRB- hardcore metal fines might even say it 's a bit too finely tuned -RRB- , melodic , yet hard and serious music that is both musically and lyrically well-made ; a treat for the Spirit and for the mind . The hooks seize your brain and do n't let go ; the lyrics are mentally stimulating and quite often pretty schizophrenic ; and the guitars are performed gloriously while unique textures are dispersed throughout the tracks to give the album a rejuvenating flavor . I often overuse the word `` energy '' in describing music , but it 's so obvious when an album has a certain positive energy to it , and Toxicity does indeed . Once the album starts its heavy momentum does n't stop until the album has concluded.The first four songs are primarily guitar and rhythm driven , and probably the hardest , most blunt tracks on the album . I do n't really care for the `` drug/prison facts '' thrown into `` Prison Song '' , but the song 's sheer force makes up for this . Likewise , `` Needles '' and `` Dance '' are agressive , angst-filled anthems that boil the blood . Ah , then there 's `` Jet Pilot '' ... `` Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot , One that smiled when he flew over the bay '' ... Great imagery , very intense song . Track 5 , `` X '' , is probably my least favorite on the album -- hard and fast , but lyrically a bit too generic for my liking.It 's ridiculous that I attempt here to describe each song , and I certainly do n't intend to when I begin this , but Toxicity is one of those albums that makes such comments inevitable . I mean , I just described the first 5 tracks on the album , and they 're probably my 5 least favorite songs ; let that tell you something ! `` Chop Suey '' is , needless to say , the most popular of the bunch , and despite it being SEVERELY overplayed over the course of time , the song , quite literally , sounds as amazing as ever -- without question one of the best songs of that year . It 's so beautifully distinct and wildly original , with great harmonics and fantastic lyrics ... Just to die for . Other favorites include `` Forrest '' , `` Atwa '' , `` Science '' , `` Toxicity '' , and `` Aerials '' ... Yeah , everything but two tracks , and even those kick ass . Again , I must mention the lyrics , `` Forrest '' and `` Science '' in particular , which I find intelligent and -LRB- in the former -RRB- very schizophrenic , but in a profound , attractive manner . `` Toxicity '' and `` Science '' observe and angrily criticize our modern culture and its employed techniques while `` Aerials '' , with its epic guitar riffs , plunges deep into Taoistic philosophies that , again , are very attractive to the mind.All in all , Hell , get the freaking thing . The only people I can see not liking it are those who simply do n't like hard-edged music . Note , however , that I absolutely get into each and every moment of it , while I find a band like Slipknot too much for me . So , as music fan that is n't particularly into heavy metal , Toxicity still burns a flame inside me.P.S . I must say , it 's great to hear an album that does n't feel the need to be overlong and pretentious . At 45 minutes , it gets the job done perfectly without wasting space or time ... Well done .
 There were two much-anticipated metal releases this year ; one , Slipknot 's Iowa , came close to surpassing the potential of their debut , but System Of A Down 's uneven , but energetic and smouldering new album -LRB- produced by the great Rick Rubin -RRB- , Toxicity , elevates the Armenian-American quartet to among the elite in hard rock today . No other metal band today is so adept at combining the aggression of aggro , unique melodies , and political consciousness as these guys.At their best , SOAD sound like the best rock band on the planet . ` Needles ' features the best fast-fingered riffs this side of Slayer , while the phenomenal ` Deer Dance ' puts a demented Middle Eastern twist on the grinding guitar rhythms Anthrax perfected fifteen years ago . ` Jet Pilot ' is just plain exciting , two insane minutes of severe energy . Best of all are the spectacular ` Chop Suey ' and ` Aerials ' , whose combinations of time changes and harmonies show auch an an intense band is capable of showing some soul without reverting to the pathetic whining that pervades nu-metal these days . Serj Tankian 's powerful singing of `` father why have you forsaken me '' in the awesome bridge in ` Chop Suey ' is thrilling to hear.Toxixity would have been awfully close to perfect if it were n't for a few songs that threaten to bring the entire album back into the realm of the sophomoric . ` Bounce ' , ` Shimmy ' , and ` Psycho ' , though musically as enthralling as the rest , are thematically stupid , sounding nothing more than frat-boy rants , and completely clash with the intelligence shown in the other twelve songs.The real star of the album is the vocal talent of Tankian . There is no other hard rock vocalist as talented as he right now , a singer capable of screaming like Tom Araya , growling like Corey Taylor , ranting like Jello Biafra , and belting out the notes like Bruce Dickinson ... all in the same song . He actually makes the huge line `` All research and successful drug policy show that treatment should be increased and law enforcement decreased while abolishing mandatory minimum sentences '' fit into a song without losing a breath . His lyrics can be a bit pretentious -LRB- `` self-righteous suicide '' ? Come on ... -RRB- , but I 'll take a bit of pretentiousness over banality any day.With Toxicity , SOAD comes very close to reaching new heights in heavy music , and this is only their second album . Their musical potential is staggering , and they should only get better .
 This is , by far and away , System of A Down 's best album . I know this review will probably not be noticed , because there are over 900 others saying pretty much the same thing , but I figured I 'd put my two cents in.The juddering , false starting intro to `` Prison Song '' sets the mood for the whole album
 In the world of nu-metal , a staid , repetitive genre not known for particularly innovative or intelligent music , System Of A Down stands out . A stew of radical politics , stattaco rhythms , Serj Tankian 's Jello Biafra-esque vocals , and angular yet melodic song structures , Toxicity is like Helmet-meets-Dead Kennedys-meets-Mr . Bungle , with a twist of Roots-era Sepultura thrown in.Just when I thought there was a serious lack of innovation in the mainstream , along comes System Of A Down . These guys are without a doubt unique . Although Rage Against The Machine tackled similar political topics , System Of A Down has an entirely different approach . Serj Tankian is possibly one of the most unique frontmen today -- he can blend harsh roars , croons , and powerful screams , often in the same song . Daron Malorkian is a respectable guitarist -- unlike most nu-metal guitarists , he actually plays RIFFS , not power chords . The rhythm work adds a real Middle Eastern feel to the music -LRB- not surprising , since two members of the band are of Armenian descent -RRB- . Toxicity contains plenty of great songs -- the obvious single Chop Suey ! , the borderline-thrash of Needles and Deer Dance , the Middle Eastern-inflected Science , and the harrowing title track . Other good tracks are Aerials -LRB- the closest thing this album comes to having a ballad -RRB- , the excellent midtempo Forest , and the rapid Shimmy . The album even ends in a cool little tribal jam.Although this album does suffer from a few mediocre tracks -LRB- X does n't really go anywhere , and Jet Pilot is just strange -RRB- , Toxicity stands as the band 's best work so far , being a bit less `` goofy '' and better-written than the debut and less overproduced and more consistent than Steal This Album . Metalheads who can look past the drop-tuning and mainstream acceptance will find that System Of A Down is an excellent band . Recommended .
 These guys have influences out the wazoo , but they 've managed to make their sound distinctly unique to their abilities and their message . With hints of Zappa , King Crimson , Tool and a gypsy caravan tambourine show , we 're treated to incredibly tight song after tight song , and with the music ever-present despite the album 's heavy politics . They do n't treat the record as a chance to preach . They rock you out , and you wake up the next day thinking , `` Gee , why do I think funny now ? `` Classic album , seriously . And I 'm not a rock head .
 Listen here KarlMarxZapata , firstly the album is called Toxicity not ATWA you dork . Secondly how can you say Aerials is boring , if its so boring why did it get to # 1 on the billboard modern rock tracks in August 2002 eh ? Answer me that 1 Einstein.Rage Against The Washingmachine is a band that pollute rock with that horrible rap music , let me guess you like Ja Rule too?You need to quit whacking off to nude pics of Zach from when he did that freedom of speech protest and start listening to the saviours of music ... SOAD . You god damn p *** y.
 I have all of these guy 's C.D. 's , and this one has to be the absolute best . System of a Down is an original ground breaking band , and if you want the best from these guys , get this one . You will not be disappointed .
 System of a Down is an awesome band , for all you SOAD haters -LRB- as seen below -RRB- :-RRB- This album completely rocks , there is n't a bad song on it . SOAD is a little strange , yes , but so is Maynard from Tool/APC . System of a Down is a very talented group and I personally appreciate the way they express their beliefs through their music . This album , along with all the other SOAD albums , is definetely worth listening to and buying .
 I absolutely LOVE this album . There are tons of groups who can knock off a couple of good songs . But `` Toxicity '' just WORKS as an entire album . I feel that its best to listen to this in order , from beginning in end to get the full experience.Chop Suey is the obvious hit from the Toxicity , but not the best song however.The best songs go in this order : ToxicityChop SueyAerialsForestAtwaPrison SongNeedles ... after that its hard to really rank the songs , but believe me they 're all good .
 This is the CD that showed the greatness that is SoaD . I was n't a fan until hearing ` CHop Suey ' one night on my way home from work and I was thinking to myself ` who is this awsome band ' and then I heard the guy say `` that 's the latest from System of a Down '' and I went ` what the hell ? I thought they sucked ' ... but I was wrong ... they do n't suck ... not at all!Prison Song - Brillant opener ... Awsome power behind lyrics that show all that is wrong with the legal system todayNeedles - Crazy song , one of the best on the album ... showcases SoaD 's intence style and wacky subjects -LRB- pull the tapeworm out of your @ $ $ -RRB- Deer Dance - The best song on the CD , about war and the horrid after effects ... just brutal and insane ... Jet Pilot - I still have no clue what this song is about ... a horse driving a jet ... it 's good thoughX - Short and sweetChop Suey ! - AWSOME , although not as good as most of the rest of the album which is a good thing , when the single that is so freaking cool you have to ownthe album is one of the worst tracks on the album then you know that the album is a masterpieceBounce - `` BOUNCE POGO POGO POGO '' A perverted song about an orgy ... I love it!Forest - Great song , heartfelt lyrics and amazing riffs.Atwa - A little strange about drawing pictures as a child and stuff like that ... I like it though ... pretty coolScience - One of my least favorite songs ... Shimmy - AWSOME , one of my favorites , up there with Deer Dance as a really cool song , really really coolToxicity - Great single , even better than Chop Suey!Psycho - About coke abusing groupies , not all that inguenious , kinda has that filling feel to it , but really , even the filler on this CD is a knotch above the restAerials - I 'm not a fan of this song , a little too comercial for me ... it 's the one song I always skip ... well , not skip just eject beings its the last song on the CD.This is a CD to own amoung all CD 's to own and stands on its own as a great slice of crazy insanity entertainment !
 Fans in the metal community often bash this album because of the band 's proximity and image association to other lackluster Billboard metal bands.What truly separates System of a Down from these bands , and dispels any criticism of the band 's musical merits , is their fresh and unrivaled sound , coupled with a genuine interest in social welfare and the rampant plague of inhumanity in the world.Toxicity takes the theory behind the band 's previous release , and tosses in more mature songwriting . The rhythmic-based assault still stands up front with the well-aged , and varied vocal stylings of Serj . When compared to the proficiency of the metal musicians I most listen to , the instrumentation is mostly simplistic , and certainly not jaw-dropping . However , this is a band that knows where its strength lay , and the whole sonic experience -LRB- vocals , guitar , bass , drums -RRB- come together to create a hard-hitting , precise groove.Whether it be the bone-chilling , vocal-lead interlude towards the end of `` Needles '' , the avalanche of melody and crunch that is `` Aerials '' , the epic-chorused `` Forest '' , the audio bi-polar `` ATWA '' , or the catchy stop-go fest of `` Chop Suey '' , this album offers enough progression , intensity , and musical cohesiveness to please any metal fan , and solidify its place as an important metal release .
 This album is System 's best so far . It has some wicked tracks on -LRB- two of my favourites being Toxicity and Chop Suey -RRB- . It is absolutley fantastic to listen to after a hard day , and you really can feel the pleasure the band get out of doing what they do . Amazing . If it was n't rated out of 5 , I 'd give it 9 3/4 out of 10 . Simply cuz I never give anything 10 out of 10 . A must-have for any rock fan . Buy it ! Now ! Your life will be sooo much better if you do.Charlie Lindley
 They 've changed quite a bit since the days of System of a Down . Not for the better , not for the worse , for the different . They 're still quite amazing . This CD is definatly worth the price .
 One day , I forgot my rap CD 's and My friend said , hey give rock a try , I did , and this quickly became one of my favorite CDs . They have some great songs , and the hardcore rock music , and the loud dude , made me listen to this 80 miles down the road . May be only 44 minutes long , but I just listend to it ova nad ova .1 . Prision Song : This song is great way to open a album , and tells the truth about society 10/102 . Needles : One great song , and it has a nice tune 10/103 . Deer Dance : My favorite song , the hook is glued in my head 10/104 . Jet Piolit : Fast , and heavy , a so so tune tho 8/105 . X : I pretty much did n't listen to this song that much 7-8/106 . Chop Suey : A great song that was a hit , and it 's heavy 10/107 . Bounce : Get 's a little annoyin , but I got da hook stuck in head as well 8/108 . Forest : It 's something about the tune that gets me in this one 10/109 . ATWA : I like it but it 's sorta odd 8.5 / 1010 . Sience : Nas is kickin knowledge , and SOAD 's kickin sience . I love the beat to this song 10/1011 . Shimmy : Very short , but very good 9/1012 . Toxcicity : Tells whats goin on in society as well , there 's a certain point where the beat gets great 10/1013 . Pshyco : This song got me sayin ' Phsyco , groupie , cokane , Crazy , Phsyco Groupie coke , makes you high make 's you hype ... 10/1014 . Arieals : This is great way to close out a excellent album 10/10I do n't expect hip hop heads like me to pick it up , but rocks pretty pretty dang good 2 me . If ur a fan of rock , or SOAD , u got ta have dis album by now .
 I have been a System fan since the release of their first album . I had never heard anything quite like it . They clearly have their own sound and a positive , informative agenda . Their first release had a very raw sound so it did take me a while to warm up to the polished , perfect metal sound Toxicity has . However , once I let it grow on me , I could n't take it out of my cd player . It is clearly one of the best albums I have ever heard . It is intense and exhilarating from start to finish . The only bad thing I would say is that I am not sure how System of a Down will ever follow up this album with something that equals the ingeniousness of Toxicity .
 From the moment you hear Prison Song , the first track of System of a Down 's incredible album Toxicity , you know that it is like nothing you 've ever heard before . I defy anyone who wants to argue that SOAD does n't have a unique sound to find any song by any other band that sounds remotely like Prison Song . SOAD 's sound takes the low guitar sound of nu metal , the manic pace and time changes of death , and the snotty political awareness of punk and fuses it all together with incredible songwritng and vocal harmonization to create a sound that is truly their own . Do yourself a favor and buy this album .
 Oh my lord ! You people underrate these guys so bad it sad . First off , Serj does n't try to sound like Maynard . He has one of the ost unique voices in metal right now . And if you seriously think that Zach De La Rocha has such `` superb '' talent , you 're on drugs . These guys take metal to a new level . I think that you guys just ca n't handle it , 'cause it 's like nothing you 've ever heard before . All the songs on this album , especially `` ATWA '' show extreme talent , and good messages . The song tells you that Charles Manson was n't a big `` evil '' guy or whatever people think of him as . He just told some people to kill someone , and they were stupid enough to do it ... Well , I 'm getting off subject . ...
 Previously , in another review , I rated this album three stars . It was a HUGE mistake !! This album makes you shout , cry , laugh , and sing along . The songs are quite possibly the best songs ever created on a rock/heavy metal album , with outstanding lyrics and jaw-dropping sound . This band took a dare and created an effect never heard before in music . Obviously , it was no mistake doing so ! The sound is agressive , mixed with beauty and softer elements . Combined , it is eerily otherworldly good ! Upon the first couple of listens to the music , you 'll probably dislike the album somewhat . Give it time , and eventually , you 'll see just why the album is so wonderful ! People can only dream of creating music this good . Toxicity is also far above and beyond System of a Down and Steal This Album ! No rock album can beat this ! You can all kiss Aerosmith , KISS , and Rage Against the Machine goodbye ! Hail to the new heavy metal kings ! Song highlights include Chop Suey ! , Toxicity , Aerials , and Deer Dance . You ca n't go wrong here ! Buy this album , even if you prefer listening to Justin Timberlake and Backstreet Boys . This will make them look like teddy bears to hug at night ! Bottom Line-DON ' T EVER MISS OUT ON SOMETHING THIS INCREDIBLY TERRIFIC !
 I love this cd . Every song on this cd is different and is also different from any other group I have heard . I like there original cd as well and recommend it to anyone who is purchasing this cd . System of a down is awesome . Thank you and enjoy ! ... : -RRB-
 ... this album by System of a down is a treasure that pops around only very seldomly . Other albums are Korn 's self titled , Nirvana 's nevermind , smashing pumpkin 's mellon collie and the infinite sadness . Toxicity is another.This album has none of that `` i hate myself and the world '' -LSB- stuff -RSB- in it . this is pure political upheaval . `` free armenia '' are some of the issues in this cd.now the music , System of a down 's music is very very memorable , the riffs are simple yet very promising and hard-hitting . And each song had some very cool and interesting solo or bridge that extends the song to becoming a masterpiece . now the best way to review a cd is by rating each song and i will do that now1 , prison song - good start -LRB- but i wanted more -RRB- then really picks up and finishes brilliantly 9/102 , needles - i hate the annoying sitar souding intro , but after that 5 secs the song is so good . its about drugs and has a really good bridge where the guitarist starts to sing . 9.5 / 103 , Deer Dance - now this is one of my favourite , should be put as a single . i love the bridge , it so mellow from the hard riffs at the start . 10/104 , Jet Pilot 5 , X ok songs , not outstanding in anyway , but good enough 7.5 / 106 , Chop suey - definately the best song on this album , very heavy with a very nice finish , i love the lyrics 11/107 , bounce - -LSB- bad -RSB- , the music is repetive , and ht elyrics dont fit this albums theme , if you want the meaning find it in some fan site . not political at all 3/108 , forest - longish song , the riffs sound slightly too docile and like some heavy version of some music i heard in one of my little sister 's animated videos . gets a bit repetitive 7.5 / 109 , ATWA - now this is something , very memorable and has a very good finish . Its about Charles Manson , yeh you remember him , that pschotic killer 9/1010 , science 11 , shimmy these are great songs but better if they are live , problem is they are inbetween to fantastic songs 8.5 / 1012 , toxicity - title track , the best song to define system of a down by . Just shows their song writing skill , got to love the short solo in this song 10/1013 , psycho - gee thanks serj , i 'm your fan yet you call me a cocain taking , psycho groupie . A bad song that insults the listener . music-wise its ordinary , yet such a beautiful solo . 6/10 -LRB- saved by the solo , otherwise 2/10 -RRB- 14 , Aerials - the end of such a great album . Its a wonder ohw hard-rockers like S.o.a.D can write something as good as this , really am left breatless . 11/10bonus track Arto - something different i think its ok 8/10go out there and buy Toxicity by System of a Down , and get their new album , Steal ths Album !! Rock on!Cya later , Anonymous Heavy music fan
 Great CD ! This is the best one yet for System of a Down . The next CD is comming out soon ! I ca n't wait for it ! But , do n't get me wrong this is a great CD for anyone who lets alternative , industrial-metal , and rock because its all in one sorta . Buy this CD if you do n't have it ! The best songs in my opinion is Chop Suey and Toxicity , but there are other very goods ones on the CD .
 Most people unfortunately assume System of a Down is a hard , heavy , controversial band . They bring these aspects into play but they are by far one of the best bands at manipulating your emotions by the flow of their songs . old classical pieces were divided up into movements . Each movement represents a part of a story , every one coming together at the end or even throughout the piece . The new single Aerials follows this format aswell as most of their songs . They 'll start you off with heavy guitaring mixed with a fast beat , then spin you off into a story which is mated to beautiful guitar and bass solos and melodies.The lead singer 's roots are from the middle-east . These influences are found throughout the record especially in Science . Science is one of my personal favourites because it is the epidemy of the movement theory , also bringing in east-indian instruments to emphasize creates an amazing combo of new and old . Those influences ARE System . Before you shoot down any band that has a heavy metal/hard rock feel , check this one out first for they are the masters .
 This is the best system of a down cd . All the songs are great . my favorite songs are Derr Dance , Chop Suey ! , Toxicity , and Shimmy . Each song is great in its own way . The band atcually puts their head in their work , and make sure that the songs are perfect .
 If you get the rage out of `` Rage Against the Machine '' , you get System of a Down . Now , for their second album , their style continues with fast guitar riffs and headbanging songs like `` X '' and `` Deer Dance '' . In a heartbeat , they declare their messages in `` Science '' ; talking about how science itself changes our beliefs and damages the world , and also in `` Toxicity '' ; how the poison of evil damages our cities . Besides the fact that System of a Down shares their beliefs in most of their songs but gives the album a twist with `` Bounce '' , a song with interesting and funny lryics about jumping around on a pogo stick . Also , I happen to see that people can not out-match Serj 's incredible vocals and lryics found in the album 's first hit `` Chop Suey ! '' . With bizarre lyrics and headbanging riffs , this album fills itself with warping styles and strength .
 I never liked System of a down that much until I heard the song `` Prison Song '' at a friend 's house . I was amazed . I never had heard such a good song . The next time I went to the store , it was the first thing that I bought . When I got home , I put the cd in and was shocked . It was the best thing that I had ever heard . I was wondering what my favorite band was the day before and right then my mind was made up . This CD moved me . THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE GREATEST CD THAT I HAVE EVER HEARD . Every song is very good . You wont even get sick of it after listening to it for dyas . The songs are all very catchy and I know the words to every song . I highly recommend this CD to anybody that likes music . This Cd is the definition of good music.If you can compare it to anything , I would say that It is hard like slipknot , Amazing vocals like Incubus , Musical Genius like Rage Against The Machine , and also , its pure fun ! Do n't even think , just listen to this album , there is no chance that anyone could ever hate this masterpiece .
 Since RATM broke up System Of A Down has taken their place quite easily . This being their 2nd alblum I expected it to be worse than their first , was I ever wrong . This CD has to be one of the most complete out there , I can listen to it from start to finish without skipping tracks because I do n't like them.The best tracks on the CD are :1 . X2 . Aerials3 . Toxicity4 . ATWA5 . Prison SongIf you wan na get away from the normal hard rock and all screaming type of bands , buy this CD .
 This is an album of a touching and beautiful sort , while still managing to be a hardcore kick - ... metal fest . These two qualities will often combine in there style with songs that protest , such as Science , and song that have a message like Chop Suey . I recommend this album to anyone and everyone because I am not a metal head and have this one in my stereo constantly .
 While I 'm not a huge fan of the hard rock genre -LRB- especially the new hard rock -RRB- , I do like System Of A Down . They pretty much play in the same vein as Rage Against The Machine , only harder and more aggressive . I kept hearing how great Toxicity is and it topped all the year end lists , so I felt I had to get it or I just wasnt human or something . Although I think I could live without it , Toxicity is much more of an accomplished record than any of the hard rock beside it on the shelf at your local music shop , and I think its worth a listen-if even for the political statements . The band is great because they have something to say and they do n't wear grotesque masks . . is n't that a little ridiculous ? `` The Prison Song '' opens the album with a loud crunch and does n't lose its steam at all . Radio Staples `` Toxicity '' and `` Chopsuey ! '' do n't aim to please-theyre there and the fact that theyre so outrageously powerful is just the way it is . Which makes me wonder why other bands just make art for themselves and not for commercial radio-I could drop some names , but I 'm not in an evil mood . It just comes down to this
 System of a Down have grown since their last CD , making one move that always surprises me in the upmost way - they removed the Parental Advisory Sticker . That is especially good for because - although I do n't mind it - I 'd rather there be no swearing , as I see it as pointless and just to get immature kids to listen to your music . That aside , I 'll talk about the Album.Musically this CD - although a tad softer than their self titled - is very heavy , and exceptionally good . The vocals are equally as heavy , although pleasingly weird in some parts . The lyrics tackle things from the Prison System -LRB- Prison Song -RRB- , to Spousal Abuse leading to suicidal -LRB- Chop Suey ! -RRB- to Cocaine Crazed Groupies attempting to change their ways -LRB- Physcho -RRB- . This is easily my current favourite CD , and is a must have .
 Heavy these guys are excellent at writing lyrics and since rage against the machine is n't around anymore these guys are using they 're anti govermant message . Anyway back to the album toxicity is great every song is perfect though you you will skip songs like jet piolit to get to songs like chop suey.My favorite songs are prison song , needles , chop suey , bounce , atwa , toxicity , psycho , and aerials .

 Their first album was better . This a good CD , but it lacks the complete insanity of the first one -LRB- Sugar , Ddevil , Darts ... -RRB- . The band is starting to head in a more mainstream direction . This CD is good , but I 'm worried that they will become progressively more poppish with each album.There are alot of songs on Toxicity , such as Science , that succeed only because of one small section . Science would be a pretty boring song if it were n't for that awesome eastern sounding bit . The songs on the first album did n't need to be patched up to sound cool ; they were brilliant to start with.If you do n't have the first CD and want to buy Toxicity , do yourself a favor and get the first one instead . Only buy this if , like me , you really like the first one and want more .
 During the Summer of 2001 , I went , as I always do , to the all day music festival , `` WBCN River Rave '' . I was late because of traffic , but arrived just in time for pretty much the only band that I wanted to see . The stage rotated -LRB- to allow the promoters to squeeze more acts in with fewer sound checks etc -RRB- and there was Serj . Clad in an orange shirt and considerably less facial hair then he had the last time I saw him -LRB- in the `` Sugar '' video -RRB- . I was a little disappointed , they did n't dress up , and he did n't paint his face . But they proceeded to bring down the house for something like 30 minutes with most of the first album . Then he came to the front and said '' ... this is our new one we just wrote , hope you like it ! '' And like a freight train , `` Choy Suey ! '' drove through my head for the first time . I had to get this album . Months later I finally got it at Newbury Comics , and my friend Scott , who used to hate anything metal that was n't Godsmack let me play the whole thing in his car . `` Toxicity '' kicks off with `` Prison Song '' -LRB- which incorporates actual research into its lyrics -RRB- and does n't let up for a while . By track # 3 I had the urge to start the CD over because I had n't caught everything yet . -LRB- Little did I know , I would still hear something new months after the fact -RRB- . But I pressed on , and when `` Chop Suey ! '' started up , I told Scott , `` This is the single ... '' and suddenly he knew which band it was . `` Acoustic Guitars ? '' he asked . It 's a shame , I had to remind him we were n't in Godsmackland anymore . The lyricism was ambitious , and the politics almost radical in their liberalism . I loved it . The bonus CD had plenty of extras , and was more than worth the extra dollar they ask.Now , the more I listen to this CD , the more I get out of it . They 've been filling in perfectly where `` Rage Against the Machine '' left off . These are songs that are actually about something . Whether it be about American Politics or worldwide issues , System of a Down handles them and makes it rock . Serj is the metal fans Bono , and it shows . He preaches during his shows like Dolores O'Riordan , but he does n't beat you over the head with the point . Usually he 's singing so fast , and the music is so loud , that with only one listen you 'll miss what 's he 's saying . They are technically superior to most other bands , using time changes , half beats , strange tunings , and studio wizardry to create a sound that is their own . Also , their sound changes from Thrash , to Hardcore , to straight Rock , to Heavy Metal in a matter of minutes . They also pay homage to their roots using polkas , and various middle eastern influences on a few tracks . This is not `` nu metal '' as many would have you believe . This rocks . But it does so of it 's own accord , not because the local DJ wants you to think it does . System of a Down is the new face of Rock , and this CD does n't let that reputation down .
 Most song on this cd i like . my favorite song is toxicity . i used to like chop suey but man , i 've heard it over a million times . well , you wo n't be wasting your money . SOAD 's first CD is pretty much the same . I bought this one first and you should too . It 's rockin ' . I would like these word to go out to everyone who reads my review `` do you cy when angels deserve to die ? '' and `` do angels ever deserve to die '' well , bye . Do n't forget to buy SOAD 's Toxicity and there self-titled album it 's not a waste of money .
 I remember the first time I saw the video for Sugar back in 1998 , just when good rock music was starting to die off , and it seemed like just another nail in the coffin . Something about it reminded me maybe of what Twizted might sound like if they decided to make music on nothing but guitar , bass , and drums . This was not a good thing , to say the least . Then I heard their song Spiders and actually starting laughing because it was such a lame , sloppy attempt at a ballad.Maybe I was missing something . But then again , Chop Suey , the first single from Toxicity did n't impress me very much either , especially with its somewhat annoying chorus part where he sings `` trust in my self-righteous suicide '' . Whatever , lets just say its grown on me since I saw the awesome video for the title track Toxicity and finally decided to buy what so many people have been calling `` the album of the year '' . The thing that makes Toxicity seem so fresh is how unconventional it is ; there 's nary a standard song structure to be found on the entire album . Its prog-rock that actually works , something that 's extremely rare in today 's music . Probably the only downside to the album is some of the lyrics , which can seem downright silly at times . `` Prison Song '' is a conspiracy theory that the government wants drugs to be sold to the people so it can lock them up and build a lot more prisons throughout the country . Ridiculous , to say the least . However , its still great to actually see a band challenging authority in America , especially now when most bands like U2 are wrapping themselves in the American flag and talking about how wonderful this country is . Even better is how the band slams Hollywood ; if you 've ever been there for even a day you 'll know that Toxicity is a much more fitting name for it . The city 's been in decline since the late '20s and is practically a ghetto by now.Anyhow , I do n't know where they 're going to go from here but for now System of a Down have made a great record .
 I ca n't stress enough how great this CD is . Litterally every song is great ... and on top of that , there are a lot of them . Unfortunately , some are VERY short and seem rushed . But in the end , the record just ca n't be any more awesome then it already is . System of a Down is one of my favorite bands , just behind Linkin Park , ADEMA , and Korn.My favorite songs would have to be Chop Suey , Forest , Shimmy , Phycho , and Deer Dance.The sound is hard , fast and loud and the lyrics are equally awesome.If you like this type of sound , then you definently HAVE to own toxicity . Trust me , its worth every penny .
 I 'm no industry analyst , and I 'm certainly not one to fall in love with just any mainstream metal that I hear on the airwaves . However , the first time I heard `` Chop Suey ! '' on Chicago 's Q101 , I got curious , thinking , `` Wait a minute here ... this is n't ` Sugar , ' nor is it ` Spiders ' -LRB- FYI
 Great CD from a gread band ... i originally heard system of a down from a friend and decided to check out their main song at the time spiders ... and then i heard chop suey and i loved it ... so i bought the cd and it didnt disappoint me one bit ... usually a band has one or two hits and the rest -LSB- are bad -RSB- but let me tell you that all the songs are great and worth the money ... i actually give it a 6 star but since that is impossible i am stuck with a 5 star ... give the cd a try ...
 system of a down 's toxicity has a beat no one can defeat . if you like metal rock with a bit of personality and meaning then this is for you . the album does not fall short of their first and can be thought of as -LRB- hopefully -RRB- a promise of things to come.daron 's work is excellent and i am quite sure no one is as talented as him at what he does . the other members are equally talented at what they do . i hope to see many , many years of SOAD to come and i am forever in debt to them for opening my eyes to what is most important , the love of music .
 If you liKE HARD rock youll love this cd . In a strange way Chop Suey ! is kinda a religeous song `` Falling to your hands I commend my spirit , Falling to you hands why have you for saken me ... '' anyways Its a great song . In most of the revios Cd 's I bought the song that is the same as the album name -LSB- is not as good -RSB- in this cd Toxicity # 13 is a great song . Ariels Is a very interesting songs it has some strange music at the end.YOU LIKE ROCK - BUY IT NOW --
 Just when it seemed I was going to have to give up my love for rock and follow all the hip-hoppers , I found System of a Down . This second album from the band has so much to offer . With the definate Middle-Eastern thing going on , it makes the album so much better . This is a very good choice for anyone who is sick of all the washed up rockers of 2002 . System , after delivering this to the fans , will be around for a while . Thnanks for a rocking album guys !
 System of a Down really stepped up their already considerable musical ability with their sophmore release . Weaving in and out of speed metal and haunting melodies with their inherited middle eastern influence creates a unique sound entirely SOAD 's own . I ca n't wait to see where they go with it when they 're next album is released later this year.If you 're into SOAD you should also check out Fair to Midland . These guys list System as a heavy influence but have a Native American influenced metal sound all of their own . If only they were to hook up with Rick Rubin !
 But I say this in a positive sense . This is the album that broke System of a Down into mainstream , and they deserve every radio play given thus far . As always , never does this CD become boring . ` System ' seems to produce the type of music that tends to grow onto you more and more as time progresses , no matter how many times you listen to it . The more you listen , the more you discover how much talent is really behind each track , all of which ending just as explosivly as they begin . To sum it all up , I recommend this to anyone who has enjoyed what they 've heard from System of a Down to this point . There 's much more behind this band than just what you 've heard on your local rock station .
 My 14 - and 10-yr old sucker me into buying these CDs with `` explicit '' lyrics , knowing I 'll never understand all the words anyway , or that I 'll probably fall in love with the music before I make out all the words . I 'm searching the house -LRB- and the net ! -RRB- for lyrics to this CD . As a good mother I should ban this stuff but I ca n't help but like it . To wake up the youngest in the morning I put in this CD and blast it , and after a few mornings I was hooked . My husband DETESTS it and after one hearing wanted it out of the house , but I think it 's brilliant . The sound is distinctive , original , disturbing , memorable . Yes , all that screaming is n't really singing -- or is it ? I just wish I did n't love this CD so much , 'cause it surely is unsavory for the kid , but hey , I used to listen to Queen 's `` Tie Your Mother Down '' as a teen
 First time ever you look at this band?This will not be your last.This is not a korn copy . . This is a new and fresh SUPER BAND ! Making revolution - like Metallica did in the 80 's . System of a down is if not th&eacute; most important music today ! Being critics , making RAGING lyrics - some very beautiful others very angry ones ! Breaking rules of music - defining new rules!These 4 men will tell you a story through SYSTEMS own diversity.This album TOXICITY with a limited DVD makes a 2 disc peace of heaven and hell!ALL songs are of tremendous quality ! SOAD made a total of 30 + songs and filtered the best stuff out - and even this is not true . Some of the other is available thorugh Steal This Album - AGAIN QUALITY ! Ever heard Innervision or Mr. Jack ? Roulette?I 'm telling you . Limp Bizkit or Linkin Park ca n't deliver the same way - these guys do it!This is not one package ! All songs bring different topics ! All different moods . Chop Suey ! makes you think - why MUST CHILDREN DIE ! Why have god/allah/buddha forsaken them ? Go cry - and then listen to Toxicity . . A hardcore packed song with absolutely fantastic drive to it . And Shimmy fx ... - > do n't be late for school again boy ! As you see the music wants more than just tell you - let 's party ! They want YOU to think ! And Prison Song . A political song - about the American prisons being filled with minor - mandatory minimum sentenced kids . . instead of helping them ... Serj Tankien - A man who thinks on his own - and questions stuff - and asks himself - look people our system is so rotten . So will you please wake up and look what goes on in the real world!They do n't love god , satan , allah , buddah or Garfield . . They are none religous . Maybe because of religions actually causing wars.So System Of A Down is here to shake you up and tell you F *** the System - think different - do n't watch MTV and listen to consumer radio . . ! BE DIFFERENT!I would say - buy Toxicity first ! The first album they made is also superb ! - but the album is much much harder to listen too ! I listen to it ? = know ! : -RRB- It 's a bit more dark and more political - Toxicity is somewhat more an introduction to System -LRB- well so I think -RRB- ! I first bought Toxicity ... then all the albums : -RRB- This album is 111 % percent quality!PEACE ON EARTH !
 I have always loved SOAD.They are brilliant and I ca n't wait to see what they do next . This Limited edition is a bright shining example of why.This cd is great and with the addition of the DVD which includes Toxicity -LRB- video -RRB- , Chop Suey ! -LRB- live -RRB- , Bounce -LRB- live -RRB- , and prison song -LRB- live -RRB- . I 've had to buy this cd three times already cause everyone of my friends are constantly trying to steal it . But , everytime I buy it , it keeps getting better and better . And the limited edition metallic blue art on the booklet is pretty neat . I give this version a 5 .
 System of adown is a band that sound like unusuual yet original , and loud yet melodic and somewhat expiereimientel . The disc , only 44 minutes long begins with lead singer serj tankian whispering `` they 're trying to build a prison '' and ends with an indian sounding flute and drums playing with occasional shouts . In betweent that time , you 'll here some of the most innovative , socialy conciouse heavy metal out there these days . The lyrics are the albums real glory here , flowing in poetry ranging from topics such as a biting satire on the U.s prison system in `` Prison song '' to the anti-drug `` Psycho . '' Like Rage against the Machine , politics are very importent to this band and if your getting sick of the usual ' i hate myself and i mso depressed ' type of lyrics that most heavy metal these days have , then this will be a relief.musically the album can get redundant , especially in the first five tracks , before the awesome `` Chop Suey '' Serj Tankians voice is a very unique one sometimes edgy and gritty , sometimes flat , making him sound somewhat like david byrn every now and then . The guitars are loud , fast paced and bone-crunching on most songs and on a few such as the title track , ringing and eerie.you definetly need to get this album , definitly if your a fan of heavy metal nad definetly if your someone searching , for intelligent , original music of any sort .
 Absolutely awesome ! Just love System of a Down ! Hope eventually to own all their albums ! Highly recommend them !
 I loved it . It comes at you fast and heavy . It took me a while to get into their music ... now I 'm hooked !!
 System of a Down are probably the best Nu-Metal band ever ! Their heritage is Armenian and it shows because of the thrash metal like riffs and Serj 's kick-ass voice ! The band 's 1st album was a self-titled debut in 1998 . It was great but just an appetizer . Then in 2001 SOAD released Toxicity and it blew everyone away ! It was a major improvement from their 1998 self-titled debut mainly because it was much more emotional and focused ! Suddenly one week after this album was released , the infamous 9/11 attacks happened ! The album quickly became controversial because its anti-government messages kind of offended some , at the time . But not even 9/11 ruined this album ! Here are the songs : Prison Song
 This is the System album that everyone recognizes . This is what got them to be so popular , and it 's obvious why . This is one of the greatest music cds ever made , only to be topped by the two System cds to come after it . This is a must buy for any rock or metal fan , no question .1 . Prison Song - Starts off weird with big guitar riffs , whispering , and complete silence . The song finally gets underway one Serj does one of his deep roars . The chorus really is n't all that great , but it 's not bad . The verses are fun and fast , and Daron just makes things even better with his odd little solo that comes in a couple of times in the song . Serj really enjoys changing up his voice over and over again in this song . This is probably the heaviest song on the cd , with all the deep roars throughout . 7.5 / 102 . Needles - Very strange song , with a very strange rhythm . The chorus is n't impressive , but does n't detract from the song , so it 's okay . Daron gets another solo in this song , but it only occurs once , and is longer . It is very , very good though , and is one of the main reasons I enjoy the song so much . 8/103 . Deer Dance - The verses are really fun to listen to , and the chorus is great . Great vocals from Serj throughout , and the drummer does really great in this song too with the cymbal . The part where the music completely drops out and it 's just Serj and Daron singing quietly in harmony is truly extraordinary . Definately a good song . 9/104 . Jet Pilot - Although he says the same thing , A LOT , this is still a good song . The verses are especially noticable . The only problem with the song is that there is little to no meaning , and it is far too repetitious . 7/105 . X - Fast-paced , but along the same line as Jet Pilot as it repeats itself a lot . Nothing all that great , mainly just filler . 7/106 . Chop Suey ! - The one System song that almost everyone who listens to the radio recognizes , and for good reason . It starts off nice , but then the first verses from Serj are n't that impressive . Not bad , just not that good . Then , when he starts singing , it sounds really good . The next time he comes to the chorus , he sings for all of it , and it is remarkable . The harmony is great there . The part where he keeps asking why he has been forsaken is amazing , and then the ending , with piano and singing in harmony , was amazing too . The only problem with this song is that it is overplayed , but that 's not exactly its fault . 10/107 . Bounce - A very funny , ` bouncy ' , and great song . I just ca n't get enough of it . Sure , it 's repetitive , but the repetition is great anyways . Bizarre and strange , but good all the way . 10/108 . Forest - This is the longest song on the cd besides Aerials . The speed at the start is deceptive , as the chorus is actually pretty slow . Serj sounds great , as always . The part where Serj starts whispering and singing quietly later in the song is really good , as well . 8/109 . ATWA - Starts off really slow and pretty , but when the chorus comes in , it packs a punch , as it completely changes the mood set up beforehand . The verses are all slow and melodic , while the chorus is rough and angry . The second time it comes in , they add this awesome yell of `` Anymore ! '' that is even better . 9/1010 . Science - Both the verses and the chorus are nice in this song . The middle of the song , where the music totally changes is somewhat mystical and awesome , making this song a definate keeper . 9/1011 . Shimmy - A song much like Bounce in how it repeats a lot , but is still enjoyable . The ending is the best part , with ` boy ' and ` girl ' being yelled out . 9/1012 . Toxicity - Another popular System song , but I really do n't understand why , as it 's not that great . It 's not bad , but it 's not outstanding , either . Anyways , it starts off really nice , and then the guitar kicks in with the drums and cymbals , and then right back to the nice soft stuff . Serj sounds great during the verses , but the chorus never really stuck with me that much . I did n't really like it . The later guitar solo is great , and the ending is really nice too . A decent song , but not one of the best , in my opinion . 8/1013 . Psycho - Repetitious like Bounce and Shimmy , but not quite as good as them . It 's still good , though , but there 's nothing too special about it . It has a really long outro , which is kinda nice . 8/1014 . Aerials - The last really popular song on the album , and I can yet again understand why . This is a really slow song , but still one of the best . Serj puts a lot of emotion into his voice in this one . There 's lots of harmony , which sounds great . Great guitar riffs , and a great chorus too . Nice ending , as well . 10/1015 . Arto - The secret song after Aerials , which some seem to think is part of it , but it 's not . It 's tribal sounding , and there 's no actual singing , other that some more kind of tribal stuff . It sounds really cool , though . A great way to end an extraordinary album . 10/10
 Who would know an album that I was not excited for at all , and was not hyped at all would be better than the album that had everyone excited , and was incredibly hyped-Slipknot `` Iowa '' . While I really do enjoy that album this album is much more creative and I think System of a Down is the all around more talented band , and it shows in this album . Serj Tankian 's vocal range is unbelievable , he is one of my favorite new singers . Some of the best songs are `` Prison Song '' , `` Deer Dance '' , `` Chop Suey ! '' , `` Bounce '' , and `` ATWA '' . All songs are good though , and you can listen to this entire CD without getting bored once . The only recent album that I can think that is better than this one is Slayer `` God hates us all '' which i recommend you get also . Buy this album .
 If you liked System 's debut album than you are gon na love this one ! I ca n't stop listening to Toxicity . This album has exceeded all standards . System of a Down as a band has matured and enhanced their musical skills in the last two years . Serj 's vocal ranges are so dynamic and the drumming is fantastic ! Like what Daron said `` There are no filler songs '' and it is evident . This album features some tasty guitar licks with groovy bass lines . If you are looking for an album to purchase that will not let you down , it is Toxicity by far . Long live System of a Down !
 I was kind of short on money but really wanted to buy this CD , and I 'm glad I did . SOAD 's second CD is amazing . It 's full of heavy guitars infused with a surprising melodic quality , searing bass lines , and hard frantic drumming . Serj 's vocals are distinct , ranging from growling and distorted screaming noises to the beautiful singing on the chorus of Chop Suey . Many of the songs are heavy and fast with brief interludes of softness . SOAD dispells the general myth that you ca n't be heavy and have thought provoking lyrics at the same time . For proof , look at Prison Song , and some of the words
 Well it was a long wait but it finally arrived , and the new System album fails to dissapoint . The production has improved , and more instruments and dynamics introduced since the first album and the change is for the better . It doesnt sound as raw and gritty as the first album , but Toxicity is laced with more melodies and even the odd harmony which all add to its beauty . Im still in shock and after listening to it about 30 times , it still sounds as good as anyhting else around . Astounding .
 After their incredible debut album , system of a down brings us this much anticipated work . The album is great for the same reason that made their first a new metal classic
 I 've never been a fan of heavy music but system is differnt .
 Toxicity delivers all the heavy , yet melodic thrills that highlighted system 's first album . smooth in-song transitions from heavy to light leave you breathless , and leave the cd with a great straight-thru listen . A unique sound overall that sets them apart from slipknot or linkin park , their armenian heritage provides a great background for a band . definitely worth a listen , dont hesitate to buy this one .
 This is a great cd . better than the first one -LRB- if its possible -RRB- If you are a system fan , u wont be dissapointed at all .
 This cd really rocks . SOAD has such a unique and energetic sound . If you like Tool you 'll love this cd . I also recommend their debut cd . buy it !
 Easily surpassing their critically-acclaimed self-titled debut , System of a Down 's `` Toxicity '' thrashes , howls , screams , growls , and bounces with a frenetic , addictive intensity , while at the same time remaining melodic and , at times , strangely beautiful and haunting . If you 're at all a fan of heavy music , this is the album to buy.The limited edition features a CD-ROM . Along with your standard extras -- wallpaper and Internet links , mostly -- there is a nice movie that features studio footage shot while recording the album . Get the limited edition if you can .
 I enjoy listening to this album whenever I want to rock !!! Ironic and thought provoking lyrics , sometimes witty . A fun listen .
 Some of there best work . One of the most original bands out . this album was ahead of its time . Awesome !
 This Was The Very First System Of A Down Album I Bought And I Had n't Really Listened To Them Before . One Listen And I Was Hooked . From Then On I Knew I Was Gon na Be A System Fan For Life . The Album Is Everything You 'd Want A Hard Rock Album To Sound Like . Great Vocals , Awesome Choruses , Catchy Songs , Amazing Guitar Work And Bass Lines .

 This is a great albulm let me tell you these guys are crazy the do some crazy but good songs this is a very unique albulm . I like system of a down they are one of my favorite bands I would reccomend this to any body who likes system of a down or Unique Rock/Metal .
 If you 're a metal fan , you 'll most likely enjoy this album . I listen to thrash , groove , sludge/doom , death and some nu-metal along with classic rock . Although elitists consider this nu-metal -LRB- no solos -RRB- , its one heavy album and the lyrics make quite a bit of sense . IMO , SOAD blow Slipknot away . This album and its predecessor are both heavy hitters . Do n't let people influence your musical tastes . This coming from a metalhead .
 Indeed it is an incredible album produced during the 2000s . I personally think this is SOAD 's best album . The lyrics and song structures are just simply perfect and matching . Definitely try this album if you 're a SOAD fan and have n't heard of this album before .
 I LOVE THIS FRICKIN ' ALBUM ! System Of A Down is my second favorite band -LRB- second only to Three Days Grace -RRB- and this album is my favorite by SOAD . They 've really outdone themselves for their sophomore album . When I first bought the CD , I was getting it for the song `` Aerials '' , but when I listened to the rest of the CD , I was blown away . I had fallen in love with two other songs `` Toxicity '' and `` Science '' . I was also amazed at how short some of these tracks were . `` Shimmy '' was only a minute and fifty seconds long ! In summary , I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who loves System Of A Down , or if you 're just a fan of rock itself .
 This was a Christmas gift for my nephew who loves SOAS . I have had this for several years and listen to it constantly . It 's still one of my favorites .
 While i think SYSTEM 's debut is their best and a TRUE MASTERPIECE , TOXICITY is the REAL CLASSIC album from this great unique band !!!!! Their debut and TOXICITY are 2 REAL MASTERPIECES from the metal scene from the late 90 's and early 2000 's ... TOXICITY got only powerful songs , full of irony and anger ... Really , ALL the songs rocks !!!! if you like HEAVY METAL i TOTALLY RECOMMEND SYSTEM 's debut and TOXICITY !!!!!! THIS IS CLASSIC STUFF !!!!! WELL DONE !!!! BRAVO !!!!!!
 Working backwards from their latest album Hypnotize , I landed on Toxicity and it blew me away . I am a huge fan of their newest album , but after hearing Toxicity it became clear why the SOAD purists say what they say . Toxicity is truly astonishing . If you are a metal fan but have not heard this album yet , consider yourself in for a treat . This is practically a genre-defining album . What fun Rick Rubin must have had putting the icing on this incredible piece of work ! Toxicity is progressive , aggressive , juvenile , and reminds us of the startling fact that , yes , they 're STILL trying to build a prison ! Another prison system , for me and you ...
 This is a perfect example of modern heavy metal . After realeasing their first album in 1998 and gaining a small cult following , System of a Down broke through to the mainstream with Toxicity , an album even crazier than it 's predecessor , with tricky time-changes , funky drum patterns , fast guitar riffs with odd tunings , and politcal lyrics sung in such a way that it almost makes light of the world 's problems . Where their first album is heavier , this one is more complex . You can find yourself in a groove , only to have it change , and seconds later have it change again . There are lots of mosh-worthy moments , and parts that sound almost middle-eastern due to Daron 's style and unique tuning.This album takes a while to get used to , it changes quickly and frequently . John is an amazing drummer and I feel he is too overlooked and does n't get the recognition he deserves.The lyrics have a purpose , at times they will make you think , and at times they will make you laugh . These guys are serious , but do n't take themselves too seriously.In my opinion this is their best work and is a must-own for any Sytem fan or metalhead in general , though it may be a little too crazy for some people.System of a Down on this album is : Serj Tankian - Lead Vocals , Keyboards , String ArrangementsDaron Malakian - Guitars , Backup VocalsShavo Odadjian - Bass , VocalsJohn Dolmayan - Drums
 Now , listen . There was no way that System of a Down could possibly top their self-titled debut , and they did n't with `` Toxicity '' . But `` Toxicity '' is still unbelievably good and it is also the album that got System of a Down into the mainstream with singles `` Chop Suey ! '' , `` Toxicity '' and `` Aerials '' . But who cares if you hear it on the radio ? Mostly everything on the radio is -LSB- ... -RSB- anyways . Except for this . Let 's look at the tracks .1 -RRB- Prison Song
 There 's no reason to individualy evaluate the songs for any of you SoaD fans ... you love all their stuff . This is second only to their debut , which was the most original CD since Antichrist Superstar . The only songs you can really be picky about -LRB- casual rock fans -RRB- are Prison Song , Jet Pilot , and X. Prison Song is really goofy and has a lot of talking in it . It basically an aquired taste . Jet Pilot does n't really have much to it . The guitar can be annoying and the lyrics are n't all that special . X is the same , really , just shorter . Toxicity is what pumped life back into metal with their rhythmic and toned guitars , original , serious/carefree lyrics , and brisk humor . Buy Toxicity and you may take your place among true rockers .
 There has n't been a band that rocks this hard since old Metallica . I love their style . They have a unique sound which combines Armenian influences in their guitar riffs and great vocal variety . Their is also a humor to all of their songs which I find very refreshing . If you like metal and music that rocks give this a try . S.O.A.D. Rules !
 Being a virign lister to this group with my only expouse to them via the trio of songs `` Chop Suey ! '' , `` Toxicity '' , and the every pouplar `` Aerials '' -LRB- that might be the only System of Down song that would be played in Super markets -RRB- that would get the raido time , suggest to me that this group was a little ruff around the edges , but basicly a mello group . Boy , was wrong about this group , for they are hard metal group , and at first I was a little upset about that , but after a repeated listening to the CD , I found out that I like it , for all of the political and social issues that are covered in this CD , after getting a good gist of what they were saying.Another thing what I like about this group is how some of their songs sound like they are totally disorganized , like a little bit over there , a little bit over here , and something here are put together in a bleder , spin around for a couple of seconds , after that they are spit out . But I think that is down on puprose , and to top that all of are two singers , Daron Malakian and Serj Tankian have some of most unquie sounding voices that I have ever heard.As I said before , if you are new this group and the only expouse that you have to this group is what played on the radio , then I suggest that you get this CD .
 A lowly Armenian/American Quartet 's second album ... it doesnt sound very flashy looking at the facts does it ? System of a Down certianlly silenced the critics , who said they 'd never make it after a ` flukey ' first album , in style . From the first track to the last , the band chune out song after song of pure quality , suitable for fans of the slightly heavier side of structured music . Any review I write will make the album sound worse ! What are you waiting for ?! Go buy it !! -LRB- recommended tracks
 this was my first and favorite system of a down cd . it is great music and can be listened to repeatedly .
 systems best albumtrack low downsprison song 8/10 as an opener to the album it is perfect very wacky with witty lyrics is more to do with lyrics than tune this one but still a worthy numberneedles 9/10 has more of a tune the beggining is a bit awkward but is an agressive bouncy piece of system song writing shows some of there melodic moment towards there enddeer dance 9.5 / 10 this showcases systems melody writing abiltys catchy verses chorus is a bit shouty but when you get to the middle section it is just beautiful malakians ability to come with melodic pieces is show cased in this short sectionjet piolet 5/10 this is not a song so much as just noise should of been on steal or not realsed at all its horriblex 4.5 / 10 at this point the album looks like its falling this is a terrible song repetitive lyrics and no tunechop suey 11/10 now this is a song the last two tracks where disapointing but this is just from beggining to finish one of the best songs ive ever heard hence the 11 out of 10 this song shows passion raw agression and there amazing ability to write melody the rap like chorus shows there wit and there intelligence as with the chorus this is a true classicbounce 9/10 hmmm this is a wierd one quite wacky good enouf to allow the album to flow nicely with out the momentum falling from such a high as chop sueyforest 10/10 this is a bouncy piece quite wierd lyrics are imaginitive and tack you into a world of your own when i look for a song i tend to look for melody but the melodies are so good and the lyrics completement it so well nice one to mosh toatwa 9.5 / 10 i now alot of people think of this as a filler but it is actually a very good song its a nice melodic piece although i will admit the chorus seems like it dosnt completely verse witch is y it misses of a 10 but i still love itscience 11/10 this one i love purely for the riff the vocals are good too but it its the raw power of the hard rocking riff that i love and the middle section seems to bring in there roots as i would say im not furmilliar with armenian music but i assume thats what it isshimmy 8/10 this song is good fun one of the rare songs written by serj along with marmalade and johnny is a good completement to the album funny witty song just a tad short for me but is a worthy listentoxicity 11/10 now i no it seems like im giving all the singles the extra marks but i think it is best for you to listen to the album and decide this is a nice number for me it has alot of nice bits to it i love the way the soft melodic and haunting verse fits with the loud commanding chorus its another system classic from listening to this albumpsycho 11/10 in alot of peoples opinion this is not infact one of there classic songs but in my opinion it definatly is it showcases a bit like chop suey did there ability to switch moods in a matter of seconds from the catchy chorus witch could have you dancing as well as moshing as it seems to pulsate through you to the softer verses later on also has a nice ending that sounds quite middle easternaerials 11/10 this is a true beauty haunting melodic threatening its got a huge sound and it just hits you from all angles in my opinion one of the best on the album lovely melody lines very catchy and memorable you will of never heard anything like this closest i could say to another system of a down song called spiders from there first albumarto 7/10 nice hidden track done with the armenian artist arto hence the name
 A week before 9/11 , System of a Down released probably the best metal album of the decade , and for sure the best nu-metal CD ever . This was their sophomore effort `` Toxicity '' . It contained 14 songs in total -LRB- and a mysterious 15th hidden track -RRB- , which were all instant classics . Some radio hits included `` Chop Suey ! '' , `` Toxicity '' , `` Deer Dance '' and `` Aerials '' . But besides these classics -LRB- these four were actually the best -RRB- were the best compilation of songs ever slapped together.System of a Down 's sound has always been loud , in your face screaming . But this is not Slipknot screaming . This is more like melodic screaming , and when lead singer Serj Tankian is not screaming , like in `` Aerials '' , it sounds great . Guitarist , backup singer and song writer Daron Malakian is one of the best guitarists today . His riffs are amazing . Simply put . Bass player Shavo is also superb , and even though you do n't hear it that much , it is still a bonus when you do.And the drummer , John Dolmayan . In my opinion , he is the best drummer in modern rock . Ask any drummer who their idol is , and they will say his name . Listen to `` Toxicity '' to see what I mean . Put these four guys together along with their strong political views of religion , war , bombs and anything else wrong with America and you got four Armenian artists called System of a Down.As for the album , everything that has to be said has been said . `` Prison Song '' , `` Needles '' , `` Deer Dance '' , `` Toxicity '' , `` Chop Suey ! '' and `` Aerials '' are the best songs there . `` Chop Suey ! may be the best song ever made . The light beginning turning into the head banging makes it extremely fun to go crazy with . `` Toxicity '' and `` Deer Dance '' are superb . `` Prison Song '' , `` Aerials '' and `` Needles '' are also the biggest highlights of the albums . Obviously the strong political views are seen in this albumThe other songs are not as great , but they still kick ass . Songs like `` Physco '' , `` Forest '' , `` Science '' , `` X '' and `` Atwa '' makes the album what it is . Put this together and you got the best modern rock album of the decade . If you have n't picked this up , you can get it cheap and it is worth every single penny . You will be hooked for the rest of your life because it is that good . If you are in the music store , pick up all of System of a Down 's albums , because they are just as good . Forget the bad reviews , there is no way you can give this CD below 5 stars .
 System of a Down makes some of the bounciest yet best sounding modern rock . They time signature changes lighting fast , and Serj 's vocals can range from a death metal roar to a great choir sound . The songs each display these characteristics in good ways , resulting in a great disc for rock and metal fans . # 1
 Before you read this , be sure of one thing . I do n't give 10 's that easily . The album IS that good . It 's awesomePrison Song
 I dont understand people . Every single soad song is amazing . I dont get people they give the cd five stars , say soad is awesome , that this cd is awesome , and then they go through and give about half of the songs 5 or 6 out of 10 . No System of a Down song deserves anything lower than an 8 . They 're the most amazing band out there . They play what they want and are so different from anything out there . How anyone can say they suck or they sound like anyone else is beyond me . There is no comparison to them . They are not nu-metal , heavy metal , hard rock , or whatever anyone else says . They are their own genre . I know of few , if any , bands that are out there doing what soad is doing . They have given us 5 amazing albums , each one unique . None of them are boring or sound old . They are all fresh and wonderful . System of a down is the best band out there.Buy this cd and anything else system of a down puts out .
 I 've been downloading songs from this CD off the Internet for weeks , but still am making plans on buying `` Toxicity '' today , it 's THAT good . System of a Down is going to be HUGE . Serj Tankian with his ingenious and socially conscious lyrics and hypnotic manic vocal style is destined to become the Bono of thrash metal , just less annoying and certainly much , much more deranged.SOAD mixes bits and pieces of their Armenian musical heritage into their sound to come up with music that you simply will not hear anywhere else . Don &#65533; t fret headbangers - this isn &#65533; t music that will be playing on National Public radio anytime soon . Armenian Folk Death Metal ? Well , it &#65533; s a clich&eacute; , but System definitely defies classification , but your getting the idea of how unique this band really is . `` Chop Suey ! '' is one of the best songs I ever heard , though buyer beware
 Well , not sure if I 'm gon na be the first reviewer ... but in any case , here 's my review : Of course in light of all the recent good/notorious news about this Armenian LA-based genius band -LRB- including the * famous * free concert in Hollywood this September -RRB- , I believe the fame of System of a Down is now spread pretty much all across the country . Their first self-titled album has grown a huge fanbase in California , especially among the large Armenian community . No wonder that all the songs from their highly-anticipated `` Toxicity '' sieved through the Internet way before the release date.Not only I perceive `` Toxicity '' as a big step forward for System , but also also an incredibly strong statement in today 's rock music . SOAD is boldly diverse , rich and deep . Their lyrics are politically-oriented and poignant which truly makes them new `` Rage Against the Machine '' , they are aggressive and powerful , yet that does not keep them away from producing remarkable melodic tunes . Their rhythm can change many times within a song ranging from a roaring speed , then suddenly turning into a marvellous slow melody . One definite plus of SOAD is their cultural heritage . A lot of times you can hear Armenian musical influence , which drives to its apex on the album 's closing instrumental track `` Arto '' -LRB- a prayer for the dead -RRB- , where the band uses Armenian duduk and hums the melody.For those who still ponder on whether to buy or not to buy , let me make this clear
 In a year that has had radical ups and downs in the music industry , from the ... of bands like Drowning Pool and Saliva . We 've also gotten a handful of classic albums from some great bands -LRB- Radiohead , Opeth , Sigur Ros -RRB- and a few great surprizes -LRB- Fantomas , Primer 55 -RRB- but Toxicity out shines all of them.System of a Down is the one band where you have to have diverse musical tastes to pin point their influences . Faith No More , Frank Zappa , and the obvious Middle Eastern themes are still present from their S/T debut , but with Toxicity they 've also developed their own sound . The guitar work is magic , just amazing chord progressions through out the whole album . Daron also does a great job with back up vocals . From his high pitched croon to his death vocals , he contrasts Serj perfectly . Shavo 's bass work is great too , ranging from Tool like plucks to adding extra thickness to the guitars . The drumming is intense and pin point in every song too . Serj has turned into one of the best front men of the 90 's , his range is great . He uses a tiny bit of death vocals here and there but has one of the most original singing voices I 've ever heard . Songs like ATWA , Deer Dance , Chop Suey ! , and well just about all of them show off his variation too . He also writes some great lyrics ranging from political -LRB- Prison Song , Deer Dance -RRB- to hilarious -LRB- Bounce , Shimmy , Psycho -RRB- to powerful -LRB- Chop Suey ! , Aerials -RRB- hey spouts off his variation in this field every chance he gets too.The album is nit together extremly well and has a certine amount of flow with it . Prison Song is a great opener with it 's great riffs and variation . Deer Dance is a stand out track with a cool message and a great ending . Jet Pilot shows of an almost thrash edge with cryptic lyrics . Chop Suey ! is a good choice of single with it 's soft and heavy passages and even a tad of strings to it . Science has great guitars , and Psycho is one of the more interesting songs on the album . But the best songs are Aerials , ATWA , and Toxcity . ATWA has a very mellow pre chorus but has some of the heaviest moments on the cd with it 's chorus , and Aerials is just beautiful with rad lyrics and a cool outro . Toxcity has great lyrics and the as we come to expect great chorus.This is THE album which is going to influence the next generation of music . So go buy it now what 's keeping you ?
 Once again they seem to go beyond what I expected . There first cd was the best ever and this was really close to beating it . SOAD is probably one of my top 3 groups that I like . If you are a fan of heavy , rock , music this cd is for you . Not as vulgar as the first . This cd really made out well in 2001 and 2002 . They got there songs Science and Shimmy on two video games . The best music video in the world is Aerials and that song is featured on this cd . The songs Toxicity and Chop Suey also had great videos made for them . Some people say Serj 's vocals are bad but I think there awesome . The drummer and guitarist are also great . I like how they start off there songs . It kind of starts off soft then gets really heavy.If you can find the limited edition version of this cd with a dvd featuring 3 live tracks and a toxicity video , get it.RATINGS :1 .

 I was shocked by the negative reviews in this list . Most of them quoted such things as `` ca n't sing , not complex , not interesting '' . Others compared them to ... dear god . . Bon Jovi and Tool.Lets get our genres right people . This is metal with a political skew . If you do n't like really loud fast riffs , but were enjoying the melody in Chop Suey , then you wo n't like this album . The trademark of this band is thier ability to have the loud mix with the soft , mix the screaming with the singing , and mix comedy with serious messages about such things as the prison system , police brutality , losing personality -LRB- chop suey , listen and think what he 's saying -RRB- ... Like the first album , this album has a different message in every song . Also , you have to accept that the band members are WEIRD . Thier sound is anything but normal . you should go to a record store and listen to thier first album and this album if you can.As for the complaints thus mentioned , do n't compare this band to any other . You have to look at what thier saying . As for talent needed to play this ? Try playing some of these on the guitar . Do n't think he can sing ? Try singing some of these lines the WAY he does . They have a middle eastern influence in both guitar and voice.If you liked spiders ... ATWA is cool . If you liked the entire first album , you will like this album beyond all belief . Oh yeah , and everyong I know who likes TOOL -LRB- I 've been a fan since 1993 -RRB- likes this band because people who get both these bands GET WHAT THEY `` RE SAYING .

 There were two much-anticipated metal releases this year ; one , Slipknot 's Iowa , came close to surpassing the potential of their debut , but System Of A Down 's uneven , but energetic and smouldering new album -LRB- produced by the great Rick Rubin -RRB- , Toxicity , elevates the Armenian-American quartet to among the elite in hard rock today . No other metal band today is so adept at combining the aggression of aggro , unique melodies , and political consciousness as these guys.At their best , SOAD sound like the best rock band on the planet . ` Needles ' features the best fast-fingered riffs this side of Slayer , while the phenomenal ` Deer Dance ' puts a demented Middle Eastern twist on the grinding guitar rhythms Anthrax perfected fifteen years ago . ` Jet Pilot ' is just plain exciting , two insane minutes of severe energy . Best of all are the spectacular ` Chop Suey ' and ` Aerials ' , whose combinations of time changes and harmonies show auch an an intense band is capable of showing some soul without reverting to the pathetic whining that pervades nu-metal these days . Serj Tankian 's powerful singing of `` father why have you forsaken me '' in the awesome bridge in ` Chop Suey ' is thrilling to hear.Toxixity would have been awfully close to perfect if it were n't for a few songs that threaten to bring the entire album back into the realm of the sophomoric . ` Bounce ' , ` Shimmy ' , and ` Psycho ' , though musically as enthralling as the rest , are thematically stupid , sounding nothing more than frat-boy rants , and completely clash with the intelligence shown in the other twelve songs.The real star of the album is the vocal talent of Tankian . There is no other hard rock vocalist as talented as he right now , a singer capable of screaming like Tom Araya , growling like Corey Taylor , ranting like Jello Biafra , and belting out the notes like Bruce Dickinson ... all in the same song . He actually makes the huge line `` All research and successful drug policy show that treatment should be increased and law enforcement decreased while abolishing mandatory minimum sentences '' fit into a song without losing a breath . His lyrics can be a bit pretentious -LRB- `` self-righteous suicide '' ? Come on ... -RRB- , but I 'll take a bit of pretentiousness over banality any day.With Toxicity , SOAD comes very close to reaching new heights in heavy music , and this is only their second album . Their musical potential is staggering , and they should only get better .
 Let me say that I have the first album , and love that , and this is just as good . It 's got the same attitude and is still heavy . It may have a few more slower songs , but they 're just as good in their own way . If you liked the first one , you should like this one , and if you 're a fan of hard rock , then you should like this .
 This album is honestly great . I am loving it . The guitars are awesome and thedrumming is great and i play the drums so i know the beats to the songs . Myfavorite song is chop suey . I think you 'll really love it . Bounce is pretty funny to .
 3 words ... Buy this Album . Period . This is the best album out this year so far excluding Tool 's Lateralus . You know what ? If I was n't already a big Tool fan I would have to pick this album as the best of the year ... Almost all the tracks are just mind blowing ... heavy yet melodic ... The best way I can describe the sound is Perfect Circle with the Intensity and drive and hard edge of Slayer . Highlights of the album include Chop Suey -LRB- excellent video by the way -RRB- , Jet Pilot -LRB- strange lyrics that I 've woken up singing in my head the last few mornings -RRB- , Deer Dance , and Bounce .
 Ok listen to me KarlMarx you little RATM loving pansey . I agree with what you said about Serj acting stupid sometimes , I too have read interviews and SOAD are trying to be funny and its just annoying but at the end of the day whats that got to do with their music ? Their music is original , creative , melodic , intense , exciting & thought provoking , how can you not love it ? You say SOAD lyrics are meaningless , what about RATM 's awful spelling mistakes ? Why do they spell `` the '' as `` da '' in their album sleeves . I 'm glad the other guys fired Zach 's ass and joined Audioslave , that band is so much better without Zach 's whiney , high picthed voice . Brandon talks a lot of sense . Karl you are a ******** moron so grow the **** up you ass ****** . Daron Malakian is GOD !!!
 I think this album produces what is great in the metal scene . It keeps you on the edge of your seat from the opener prison song to the end aerials . -RSB- 1 . Prison song - A great opener for an album . Very lively . 9/102 . Needles - The best song on the album . Very catchy tune . 10/103 . Deer Dance - Another great song . 9/104 . Jet Pilot - What a song . You never know what comes next in this song . It changes from a punk song into a kind of eastern tune . 10/05 . X - A good song . A bit too short . 8/106 . Chop Suey - The single . Great song another one of my favourites . 10/107 . Bounce - A very quirky song . Its very good but a bit short . 9/108 . Forest - Brilliant song . 10/109 . Atwa - The srecond best song on the album 10/1010 . Science - The worst song on the album . A bit boring . 7/1011 . Shimmy - The song is very good . A great jazzy bit in the middle . Again to short . 9/1012 . Toxicity - A great great great song . A classic . 10/1013 . Psycho - Another good song . Lively . 8/1014 . Aerials - A great way to end the operfect album . 10/10Altogether the greatest album for a few years .
 Ok here 's what you need to remember . These songs get old . Toxicity got old to me in about 4 months . Also there are a few songs that are not good . But in other words this is a good album to start off with if your gon na become a system of a down fan . Here 's how I rate the songs , for those who are interested . If not just do n't read on cause , I gave my review .1 . Prison Song
 Being only 15 years old , I have n't had much time to grow an amazing intellectual viewpoint on music . But being somewhat musically inclined made me write this review , picking out some songs to explain their meaning :1 . Prison Song -LRB- 5/5 -RRB-
 I think this album could n't get any better than this . Even their other albums as well you can listen to them front to back and still listen to it again . Rock on System Fans ... . I know you love their albums .
 1 . Prison Song - 4.52 . Needles - 43 . Deer Dance - 44 . Jet Pilot - 55 . X - 4.56 . Chop Suey ! - 57 . Bounce - 58 . Forest - 4.59 . Atwa - 410 . Science - 4.511 . Shimmy - 512 . Toxicity - 513 . Psycho - 514 . Aerials - 5Lyrics - WACK !!!!! Production - WACK !!!!
 Ok , here 's how the tracks break down .1 . Prison Song - 9/10 I believe this is the most political song on this album , completely bashing the modern prison system , and i completely agree with . comes with an unforgettable stop-start riff at the beginning .2 . Needles - 6/10 Meh , i do n't like this song much . I mean , i like the music , but the lyrics are kind of half-baked . no real subject , its kind of about how some people totally take control of your life like some kind of parasite , hence the line ` pull the tapeworm out of your a ** ' .3 . Deer Dance - 11/10 BONUS POINT ! oh yeah , this is it . this is the best song on the album , possibly of all SOAD . The lyrics remind me of Mr. Jack on Steal This Album ! , a song that i used to be completely obsessed with , lol . its all about police brutality , which is quite true , because recently an officer shot a rubber pellet into a mob and killed a 17 year old girl , which really blew me off . i love the pre-chorus , right before Serj starts screaming ` pushing little children ... ' Excellent song , infinate stars .4 . Jet Pilot - 8/10 Even though this song has no real meaning , i think its really funny :P ` Wired through the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot ' Totally random song .5 . X - 9/10 Short but sweet , nothing else to say .6 . Chop Suey ! - 6/10 Yep , here we are . the big single . * takes deep breath and prepares to have food thrown at * I DONT LIKE THIS SONG MUCH . there , i said it . I think its way too repetitive , and repetitive means nu-meal , and Serj and the gang just cant drop that low . Sorry people , just my opinion ... 7 . Bounce - 8/10 A strange song about a pogo stick O_o Drug-influenced , anyone ? 8 . Forest - 9/10 Strangely , this song reminds me of Korn . im crazy you say ? i mean , come on . it has the clicky bass , a fast paced heavy rythm , and refers to difficulty with social situations . and i love every korn song , so 9 out of 10 it is .9 . ATWA - 15/10 Yeah , remember how i said that deer dance was the best song on the album ? screw that . THIS is the best song on the album . It stands for Air , Trees , Water , Animals , and is about charles manson . if you know about hat he did , it is a very touching song . im telling the truth when i say that i almost cry every time i hear this song , because its just so sad to me about how when charlie wanted to spread his views on pollution to help make this world a better place , and nobody cared and just pushed him aside , he just went on a rampage and hypnotized those people into killing , hence the line ` you do n't care about how i feel , i dont feel that anymore ' ... its just the most moving song i have ever heard .10 . Science - 8/10 This song is cool , but i heard somewhere that its a joke . what 's with that ? i think the lyrics are absolutely true ... 11 . Shimmy - 7/10 Seven out of ten for the lyrics . If you look up the words in the dictionary , this is one of the funniest songs you will ever hear . at least , it was for me . about the wacky school systems in our country .12 . Toxicity - 9/10 The difference between toxicity and chop suey , the two biggest singles -LRB- besides aerials -RRB- is that i really like this one . with words abot how man doesnt care about the environment and just wants to build and build and build , this song will remain true until the end .13 . Psycho - 7/10 PSYCHO ! GROUPIE ! COCAINE ! CRAZY ! nice .14 . Aerials - 9/10 See track 12 . And then a bonus song at the end that i dont know how to rate.The grand total is ... 121/140 ... This album gets a B ? Well , its so good im promoting it to an A :P YAY ! SOAD FOREVER !
 Toxicity delivers all the heavy , yet melodic thrills that highlighted system 's first album . smooth in-song transitions from heavy to light leave you breathless , and leave the cd with a great straight-thru listen . A unique sound overall that sets them apart from slipknot or linkin park , their armenian heritage provides a great background for a band . definitely worth a listen , dont hesitate to buy this one .
 more often than not , the first album a band comes out with is generally considered their best . -LRB- I.E. Stone temple pilots , korn , rage against the machine ... -RRB- . I expected this album to be good , but not great . I even told a friend of mine , `` their first album was great , and will be really hard to top . '' but they did . there isnt a song I dont like on it ! my favorites are Forest and ATWA . but I never go directly to the songs , I start it from the begining , and let it play all the way though . this album is great and I had a good laugh watching the documentary video of S.O.A.D. that came with it . I highly recommend this CD . you wont be dissapointed
 toxicity is a rare cd for me ... i love it ... i 've listened to it nonstop since i purchased it ... i want to tell everyone i know how awesome it is ... but ... i have no words that do it justice . i ca n't explain the different paths the music takes on this disc ... each song is full of jagged peaks and peaceful valleys ... and it all fits ... and it all sounds great . some of the songs are a bit childish at first listen ... perhaps that 's just a bit of culture clash ... as this is not an american point of view kind of band ... which is a good thing . it is wonderful to get some diversity into today 's rock/metal scene ... nothing kills music like mindless repetition ... if it 's selling ... manufacture 20 more bands just like it ... well ... system of a down is like nothing else ... it 's like someone took the best bits of faith no more , sex pistols , ramones , rage against the machine , sabbath , and infused it with this incredible desire to make their music a force for right ... as well as something to make you dizzy with excitement in the mosh pit . great , great cd ... and a great band that i hope survives the ever decaying record sales for rock bands that challenge listeners ... it 's worth the price ... but do n't expect another clone band ... they are loud , fast , rythmic , and utterly unlike anything out there .
 There is alot of crap on the tv and on the radio these days . So many cheap bands who call themselves `` metal '' But System release another awesome album that is even more quirky and original than their first effort . System is one of a few good new heavy metal bands who do everything from punk to thrash to jazz to middle eastern styles . This is an album for fans of good taste . SOAD HAVE SAVED US !
 This is such a great CD . More melodic tunes than their last album . . but heavy at the same time . My favorite song has to be Chop Suey ! followed by Deer Dance and Jet Pilot . Serj has a one of a kind voice . I have n't checked out the Cd-rom yet . . but I bet it 's great . This is a must-have CD .
 this is by far one of the most interesting albums i have ever heard . it goes from thrash to mellow dramatic.from one extreme to the next.even if you are not one of the thousands of system of a down fans it is definately worth listening to if you like music that suddenly changes from one beat to the next it goes from thrash to chris cornell like lyrics and is rated very high on my list
 While most are ranting and raving about the new Slipknot CD -LRB- Iowa -RRB- the album that should be getting the praise and respect is System Of A Down - Toxicity . Rick Rubin has produced a fine piece of work in `` Toxicity '' by letting SOAD continue where they left off from their vastly underrated -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- self titled debut from almost 3 years ago . It 's amazing how you can take a band like Slipknot , who technically is on an independant label -LRB- Roadrunner Records - as far as I know they 've never come out to say they 're a major label but I could be wrong -RRB- and they put out what I feel is a weak effort when compared to their first album . Let 's face it , the heavier tracks on that CD seem to be on there to satisfy die hard Slipknot fans while most of the tracks are tailor made for radio airplay . Whereas with System Of A Down , there 's barely any radio friendly tracks on the CD and not only are they on a Major Label who would like nothing more than to have and album full of hits but they have one of the best producers in the world who 's helped produce top 10 hits for the Chili Peppers but SOAD manage to stay true to their artform while teetering very little to a Radio friendly sound . Besides the current single `` Chop Suey ! '' , what else can possibly be released as a single and actually played on MTV as well ? I honestly do n't see any other songs on this album becoming big radio hits or -LRB- dare I say -RRB- TRL picks of the week . With this album it 's almost impossible and that 's what 's so great about it ! Top to bottom this is a perfect CD ! Lyrically it 's great as well as musically . Everyone involved in the band puts in a great performance on every single track . An absolute MUST buy !! If this album dose n't sell millions of copies , I 'm giving up hope that real Metal fans truly exist . Highlights include `` Prison Song '' , `` Needles '' , `` Jet Pilot '' , `` Chop Suey ! -LRB- of course -RRB- '' , `` Toxicity '' and `` Psycho '' . I ca n't wait for the 3rd album !! Let 's just hope we do n't have to wait 3 years for it :--RRB- Also for fans of Rick Rubin , the new Slayer album is out as well . These are 2 Rick Rubin masterpieces released in one Month . True Metal for True Metal fans !
 the wait was definately worth it . This cd is spectacular . I 'm listening to it now as I write this . Their first cd was phenomenal , and now in many ways I see this cd as better . The vocal harmonies are awesome , the rifts incredible . Its not overdone and gives off a strong message . Mixing in their own styles and that of their heritage has created a truly wonderful listening experience .
 The guys from SOAD out did themselves with this sophmore album . From the opening track Prison Song you are drawn into the ferocious mayhem and at the same time subtle beauty that only SOAD could create . This album blew me away , there is not a bad song on here and Serj 's vocal range goes from soft melody to out right demonic growls . Serj shouts and screams his lyrics over soem truly awesome guitar work by Daron . This album is harder , heavier , more left-of-center politically then their first album . Rage Against the Machine dropped the ball musically speaking and SOAD has picked it up and they have ran with it . I urge all metal fans and RATM fans to go pick this masterpiece up because I know you 'll be as blown away as I was .
 This album is a bit heavier than the first one , i liked the first more , because it changes pace a bit more . but over all it 's a great cd , and if you enjoyed system of a down 's self titled album then this is definitely worth buying !
 After listening to their first heavily Nu-metal laced album , I was n't exactly blown away as I can only take the whole `` distorted growl into the mic '' thing for so long . However , when I finally got around to getting this album , the first thing I noticed how different it was . Within a few short listens , I soon realized that this album was absolutely brilliant . It does n't take long for it to grow on you either -LRB- as did Tool 's last release ;o-RRB- . The production is suberb -LRB- Rick Rueben is a class-act producer -RRB- and from a musicians standpoint , its obvious the band has matured musically with more emphasis on melody and complex structures and counterpoint . While the lead singer 's -LRB- Serj -RRB- lyrics are a bit absurd at times and do n't exactly hit the nail on the head , his amazing voice more than makes up for the fact . One of the reasons the he sounds so unique is his genius use of micro-tones in his vocals . As most of us know , this band has an Middle-eastern influence being from Lebanon and/or Armenia . One of the coolest thing about Middle-Eastern music is that they use the `` note between the note '' in their musical scale . While Western music uses only 12 notes in an octave -LRB- the range before the note `` repeats itself '' -RRB- , Middle Eastern music uses 24 -LRB- at least -RRB- . Having twice as many possibilites , opens up the musical spectrum in a way that simply has not been done with music of this genre . It breathes a great amount of fresh air into an otherwise rather mundane and passe metal scene . Very few albums get my 5 star rating -LRB- not even Tool 's amazing last effort -RRB- so I have to go with the 4 star . However , if Amazon had a 4.5 star option , this is what I would give this excellent CD .
 Forget the labels -LRB- Nu Metal ? -- are we Yiddish or just ca n't spell too good ? -RRB- , forget the comparisons to the mediocre market filler that poses as today 's cutting edge rock -- this is the real thing . The two singles , Chop Suey and Toxicity , blow everything else off the radio , and the rest is n't far behind . Unlike 99 % of today 's noise bands , SOAD understands that lyricism and power can coexist , and each is made more potent from the combination . The best songs snarl and pound , and then soar into terrific melodic passages -- and this guy can sing , unlike just about anyone else out there today.Complaints ? Well , a few . The leftish political correctness can turn cartoonish -LRB- Prison Song is pure tract -- more in the heavy-handed realm of Rage Against the Machine ; the spoken statistics are about as sophomoric as it gets -RRB- . Some of the songs , like Jet Fighter , are little more than shouted slogans , and some of the lyrics could use help . The -LRB- still great -RRB- power of Toxicity is undermined by the nonsense refrain `` eating seeds as a past time activity '' -LRB- or maybe the allusion is just too subtle for my ozone clouded brain -RRB- . On the other hand , recasting the Christ myth as a `` self-righteous suicide '' is brilliant -- so far beyond anything else since , oh maybe 60 's Bob Dylan , that most listeners probably do n't what to make of it . Now if only someone could explain the part about leaving the keys out on the table .
 Hands down , this is by far my favorite CD ! From Chop Suey ! to Atwa to Aerials , this CD is awesome ! The lyrics and tight beats backing up Serj are amazing . I 'd give this thing 1000 Stars if I could , but Amazon only allows 5 ...
 System Of A Down 's new cd Toxicity is definitly something that had originality but kept to it 's roots . System 's first cd was awsome with the great lyrics and great guitar riff 's and same with Toxicity . System 's new songs have flavor and style which keeps me hooked on them !
 First off , let me qualify my review by saying I do n't like ` Nu Metal ' . Korn , Slipnot and the like do not have a home in my C.D. collection . I 'm an old-school guy . Iron Maiden , Dream Theater , and old Metallica are more my speed , but once in a while there 's a new band that comes along that has something new to add to the great melting pot of hard rock . Tool is definitely one of those bands , and now add System of a Down to that short list . The key to appreciating this disc is being truly open minded to the many sub-genres of hard rock . S.O.A.D. is not merely a ` nu metal ' band . True , they have the heavy edge and attitude of Godsmack , but they also possess the wacky sense of humor and oddball song structures of Primus blended with the socio-political rantings of the Dead Kennedys . Now I 'm sure there are a few people out there who do n't like Primus and have never heard of Jello Biafra . That 's O.K. . You might still like this album if your not expecting epic progressive rock nor pure power crunch . This music is both explosive and dark , while also being fun fluff . It is creative without being brilliant , but in its simplicity there is a certain amount of genius.Apart from the above rant I share the feelings of many reviewers . The singer is amazingly diverse , and the guitarist , bass player and drummer play some amazingly tight rhythm together that would make Slayer proud . All in all , great playing and clever writing , for this style of music.I ca n't argue with those that say that `` Chop Suey ! '' is the best track on the disc . That song pretty much has their whole bag of tricks mixed up in one package ; replete with start/stop song structures and mood changes . However , after a few listens there are many songs that rate a VERY close second ; including `` Prison Song '' , `` Deer Dance '' , and `` Forest '' . Frankly , I 'm not sure who this music would appeal to most . I 've no doubt that ` Nu Metal ' fans would find the majority of this disc satisfying . However , I think that if you 're a fan of any kind of really intense music , you might want to check this one out .
 This is one of the best CDs i 've purchased . All of the song are alive and different . Real good bass and good all around audio sound . This currently one of my favorite CDs . I 'd give it 6 stars if I could .
 Is the sophomore effort by SOAD as good as their eponymous debut ? Absolutely ! As a matter of fact , it bests the first album in just about every way . The songs are strong , melodic and fierce , and the instrumentation is much improved . Every song on this disc is good to great , with prison song , needles , chop suey , science , toxicity , psycho and the immense aerials leading the way . The songs are so good simply because they are a breath of fresh air at a time when conformity and sameness permeate the music business . From the alternating crunch/beauty of Chop suey , toxicity and aerials , to the sheer variety of sounds they ... coax out of their instruments -LRB- sounds like Daron Malakian is playing a mandolin on Chop Suey -RRB- , these songs sound like no other . In addition , Serj 's voice is an additional instrument as he seems to have several different styles -LRB- from deep-throated growl to pleading wail ; the only other hard rock vocalist with a range like Serj is Glenn Danzig -RRB- . Anyway , do yourself a favor a pick up a copy of this CD -LRB- the bonus CD stuff is cool too -RRB- and enjoy some flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck.Paul M
 this album is the messiah . a gift to all true rock fans . system of a down are a 21st century metallica with a surpassing lyrical content to that of rage . the foursome hailing from armenia , based in the wonders of L.A have created a sound so original and astounding it is breath taking ! their sound varies from nose-bleeding high tempo thrash metal to relaxing harmonic seronades between serj tankian and daron malakian . all conglomerating to create the ` perfect ' rock album . songs to look out for are the two singles ; chop suey ! and toxicity and personal favourite psycho . this album will give you the highest adrenalin rush possible from a cd . to not purchase this cd would be a sacrilage to oneself and ones generation .
 I have been listening to SOAD since thier first self titled album -LRB- also a must listen to -RRB- and had high hopes for this album . Though Toxicity definitly has a different sound than their first album , it is just as good . Even if you are not sure if you like Chop Suey ! I would recomend listening to some other songs by SOAD , such as Prison Song , Aerials , Innervision and The Legend of Zelda -LRB- both not on the cd , but on the net :-RRB- , because all of thier songs have a style of thier own .
 When system of a down 's self title came out in 1998 , I was most impressed with Serj 's scream and the original songs that came out . The songs were fast and Serj 's scream hit every song like bullets . I picked up this cd after hearing it off a friend.This album `` Toxicity '' is much more instrumental . Serj uses his voice more and Darren sings as well in Chop Suey and Needles . This album is much more wacky and different sounding than the first album . Songs like `` Bounce '' and `` Phsycho '' jumpy songs that do n't capture as well as the other songs but `` deer dance '' and `` jet pilot '' not to mention `` X '' are catchy songs.This cd is great if you would want to hear Serj 's voice and how he dramatically uses it in his poetic lyrics .
 system of a down combines the hard rock of groups such as korn and smashing pumkins with the operatic rock of such groups as queen . above and beyond
 What a disc . Out of the five biggest releases of the metal scene - this , Tool 's Lateralus , Slipknot 's Iowa , Machine Head 's Supercharger , and Incubus 's Morning View -LRB- sorry Slayer and Megadeth fans , I 'm talking commercial wise -RRB- , this has to be the best - and I have n't heard Incubus yet , so you can tell I mean business . The massive range of influences on show mix together in a blend so potent that a fan of only one of the styles on show will almost certaintly love every track . `` Prison Song '' - self-explanatory . This is what Rage Against The Machine did , but did n't . `` Chop Suey '' , the first single , is stunning , an amalgam of twisting styles , with a very sweet melody from Serj . He 's got the `` best . . metal voice ... EVER `` And before you come to a jarring HALT , one last piece `` Aerials '' , shows the band 's Eastern influences . Closing in at an all-too-brief 44 minutes , it 's even better buying the Special Edition CD-ROM version -LRB- red cover , making-of CD ROM , 3 extra tracks - that makes 18 -RRB- . Good Good Good ! Not only is this the best metal album so far this year , it 's an awesome introduction to a wider range of styles . As Pitchshifter said - `` GEEEENNNNIIIUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUSSSS ! ''
 When I first heard the singles Aerials and Toxicity I knew I had to check this album out . I read some of the reviews on amazon and were more or less accurate to how I feel about this album . The vibrant ` Prison song ' starts the show and sets you up for some serious rocking and it just flows from one song to another so easily . Technically they are brilliant Serj Tankian 's voice is so unique and hauntingly changes from madness to mellow in seconds . There are , in my opinion 10 great songs on this album but one to look out for -LRB- after the favourites Chop suey , deer dance , Toxicity and Aerials -RRB- is ` Forest ' the drumming and guitars are mind blowing . Buy this album !
 Having not purchased SOAD 's first cd , I had labeled them one-hit wonders after I heard the song `` Sugar . '' When `` Spiders '' became a hit , I was genuinely surprised . When I first heard `` Chop Suey , '' then learned it was from them , I knew 3 songs were no fluke . I picked up this cd the day it came out , and I must say , I have been greatly impressed by this cd . The way they can incorporate Middle-Eastern styles into hard rock is amazing to me , and the vocal talents of Serj are hardly limited to screaming . I ca n't wait to hear the next offering from these guys , hopefully they can step it up one more notch .
 I have many albums I 've bought and listened and just really did n't ` feel ' ... Limp Bizkit did that to me with their new material , as do many bands ... Anyways , when I bought this album , I immediately ate this thing up.The layering of guitars , the schitzofrenic timimng , the oddball vocals , the thought provoking lyrics make this the most solid metal album I 've heard in a while , if not 2001 . While bands like bands like Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit were busy doing rap metal , System Of A Down spent some times writing and creating a solid metal album . And I bought this album at about the same time I bought the new Slipknot album , and I will tell you , this blows Iowa out of the water . The lyrics are not about ' I hate the world ' or ' I will take the life out of that -LSB- stuff -RSB- you call a heart ' type stuff . Instead Serj and crew wrote about pressing political issues -LRB- Prison Song -RRB- , psychotic cocaine snorting groupies -LRB- Psycho -RRB- , police bruitality -LRB- Deer Dance -RRB- , and so on.But every one of the songs is beatufily written -LRB- with the possible exception of the somewhat short and weak Bounce , my least favorite track on the album -RRB- , and has crazy timing changes , speed metal inflected drums , punk guitar power chords , and one of the best vocalists in modern rock today , all to make this solid , catchy , totally unMTV sounding record ...
 I , being a fan of differnt types of music , recently purchased Toxicity by System of a Down . I had heard three songs from the disc at a retail store and had seen the videos , and i enjoyed them . Was I disappointed ? Evidently , by the rating I gave the disc , i was n't . I purchase music on a frequent basis and i must admit i could listen to the disc all the way thru without changing tracks . I admit i have some music which i bought for just a couple of songs -LRB- have n't we all ?! -RRB- , but to have a disc or tape that you can listen straight thru is a rarity.If you have an open-mind , musically and are tired of the radio-friendly music . Check out SOAD 's Toxicity .
 System of a Down are one of the best nu-metal bands EVER !! I personally think that System are alot better than Rage Against the Machine EVER was . I love the middle eastern influence heard in their metal , it gives them a unique perspective . Anyway this album is HIGHLY reccomended to anybody that likes nu-metal bands like Slipknot or Rage Against the Machine .
 I first heard System of a Down when the song Sugar off their first CD came out . I was immediately hooked to the song , and purchased the CD . I then heard the song Spiders , which completely blew my mind . Being that this is a review for Toxicity and not their first album , I will just say that the first album was very unique and pretty good . However , Toxicity is a modern-day rock masterpiece.When Chop Suey was first released as a single a month or so before the album 's release , I heard it play on the radio and could n't get it out of my head . It was the catchiest song I had heard in recent years , and the juxtaposition of sound was incredible . The way they could be so harsh and then transition to melodic and harmonic was outstanding . I knew that the day the album came out , I would purchase it , listen to it , and love it.When I listened to the album the first time through , I was a bit taken back by the way it sounded . Chop Suey sounded very different than the rest of the CD , but in a good way . That is because each song has its own flavor , uniqueness , and originality . The second and third times I listened to the album , I completely loved almost every song on the CD .1 . Prison Song - 10/10 Hard , with a message that has been conveyed before , but is done even better here .2 . Needles - 10/10 You may think its another song dealing with drugs , but it is more than that . It uses a completely new metaphor that adds a new shade to the subject . Features a nice solo .3 . Deer Dance - 10/10 One of my favorites , sounds different all throughout , starting with the hard intro , then the mellow verse , the funky chorus and solo , and then the second chorus which is all out heavy . Sweet solo .4 . Jet Pilot - 7/10 This song is a bit too loud to listen to on a regular basis , and I often skip it when I listen to the album because of its loudness . But it still manages to be a very good song .5 . X - 7/10 Again a song I usually skip , but I do still enjoy it .6 . Chop Suey ! - 10/10 The song that started it all , turns out to not even be the best song , but is one of them . The trippy , melodic chorus mixed with the crazy verse .7 . Bounce - 7/10 Interesting sound , but the loud factor , OUCH .8 . Forest - 10/109 . Atwa10 . Science11 . Shimmy12 . Toxicity13 . Psycho14 . Aerials
 the first song i heard from system was `` spiders '' a couple of years ago ... the video was awesome and i loved the song ... then i heard `` chop suey '' when it first came out ... it got me so pumped . . so i bought the album ... 1st listen through was a little wierd ... then early one morning i listened to the whole thing straight through ... unbelievable album ... i listen to it just about everyday ... this album rocks hard ... if u 're thinkin about buying it ... do it ... system of a down is one of the best bands around today !!!!
 i 'm sure everyone else is doing the same , but this album is truly a work of genius
 I got this cd after most of my friends at school recommended it to me and i 'm sure as -LSB- darn -RSB- thankful that they did . All the songs are awesome , there 's not a single song that is below average . Some of the outstanding songs are `` Toxicity '' , `` Deer Dance '' , `` X '' , and `` Psycho '' , but each of these songs deserve to be the highlight of the cd . Hear it once and I 'm sure you 'll enjoy it .
 and made right ! I 've been in love with them them ever since the release of `` Chop Suey ! '' on the radio . So pretty soon i downloaded `` X '' and `` Chop Suey ! '' off the internet . Within two days I had heard it blaring nextdoor , so i hung out for like thirty minutes by a window listening . Then my brother got one of his friends to burn the cd . The lyrics are so smart , and the aggressive beats are aweosme . You can not be system of a down no matter how hard you try . The driving guitars , the fast drummming , the good bass . It all comes together , and I think the fact that Serj -LRB- singer -RRB- is arabian really makes the singing interesting . Buy it ! It might scare you if you like JImmy eat Wortld , hoobastank , incubus , linkin park , etc. . No rocker should live without it . You dont know what ur missing .
 I said it before , and I will say it again ... I love being a tur ... oops ... sorry . I Love this band !!! Toxcitity is a huge jump from their previous album . And once again they hit the scene hard with very powerful issues of government and drugs . Their is obviously more to this album than just that , but I am just getting started . First off , the `` Prison Song '' , happens to be the first song on the album . It states that government is trying to imprison our society . -LRB- atleast how i feel -RRB- System of the down continues its reign as one of the most intruiging bands of this era in music . I ca n't wait to listen to their next album . I am sure that they are just going to keep getting better , and better , and so on . Enjoy !!!
 System Of A Down gave us the unarguably best album ever in Toxicity . The two songs that brought them from an easy to achieve amazing to an much tougher mainstream amazing , Chop Suey ! and Toxicity are not the best songs . The hidden gems are definitely Psycho and the best opener ever , Prison Song . The end song , Aerials , is another song worth praising . While mainstream sucsess and amazing content are tough to have , Toxicity more than gives it , adding System Of A Down to the greats list .
 there are two sides to heavey meatle , the screaming pointless side , and the side that speaks of a troubled life , modren politics , and/or religon/spirtuality . system of a down is the second type . they are one of the shrinking class of bands that are popular because they are actualy good . this album can blast your ears out but you can actualy understand what they are saying . these guys have been my 2nd fav . for about 3 years now -LRB- following linkin park closely -RRB- . the overall message of system of a down is to always think really hard before you vote or make some kind of political or religous descision in your life . i reccomend also getting their self titled debut with toxicity . other bands that go good with system of a down : morbid angel , slayer , linkin park , disturbed , stainds second cd dysfuntion , korn , and metallica .

 In a word , WOW ! With their second album System have achieved a musical effort worthy of any metal gods . Powerfull yet elegant , every song has its own style and meaning . At first the music may seem wierd , but keep listening . Such a diffrent approach to music is a shock to the SYSTEM . The infectious groves and inspired lyrics will soon have you hooked . This is one of the best albums I 've ever heard . Buy this album NOW !
 One word describes this album very well : EXCELLENCE.All of the songs are good on the CD , but the following are my top tracks on the album : - Prison song - X - Forest - ATWR - Psycho - AerialsJust buy the album -- you wo n't be disappointed -LRB- unless you did n't like Chop Suey ! or Toxicity either -RRB- .
 This may be the most original major-label album of 2001 ... One just needs to listen to the title track , `` Bounce '' , `` Aerials '' and `` Chop Suey ! '' and THEN try to define the genre ... people should n't even try . Actually , I 'd be hard-pressed to define the first song , `` Prison Song '' , let alone any others . Toxicity is a more ambitious album than their debut , and System pulls it off without changing for the mainstream , letting the mainstream adapt around them instead . Ca n't even say they sound like anyone else .
 I am addicted to this CD ... worth every penny I paid for it ... nothing more to say .
 System of a Down 's Toxicity is an instant classic . By far the best metal band out there . No can sing like Serj , and their distinct sound is great . Toxicity does n't sound the same as their self-titled album , but they do n't stray too far from the sound that makes them unique . With less screaming , and more singing Serj proves his vocal talents have grown since the 1998 debute . The single Chop Suey ! being one of the best songs on the album , only helped the urge to get this the second it came out.Some of the songs are alittle on the short side , but they still kick a ** , they do n't have all of those un-neccasary solo 's . The shorter the song , the faster and harder it is . Like Shimmy , Bounce , Jet Pilot , and X. My only realy complaint is the amount of tracks left off . Like Johnny , F**k the System , Innervison , K.I.T.T. , and Chick N Stew . Songs that for no apparent -LRB- well not apparent to me -RRB- reason where left off an ' otherwise classic album .
 First up , I 'm a dedicated Christian , and `` Chop Suey ! '' seemed to misquote Christ as giving up on humanity , and crumbling into self-styled pity and suicidal despair.The happy themes of Elvis and Chuck Berry , these songs ai n't . Still , after some self nudging -LRB- and an extra 20 $ bill in my wallet -RRB- I picked the disc up and gave it a spin . Said truth be told , IT in fact IS an excellent album , one of the supreme best of it 's kind , emerging with spectacular production values , innovative musical skill , and bold , defiant songwriting , from Serj 's vocal prowess , to the underpinning radical social commentary . Unfortunatly , I am not in the `` System 's '' majority who feel that the government is a turncoat threat to the welfare of our country , or in regard , to the prospering policy of other nations . `` Prison Song '' is an excellent song , complete with mid-tempo changes , witty lyrics -LRB- Malakian is a toungue in cheek prodigy -RRB- and style to spare , but frankly , our governement is not the epitome of an evil empire . System rails against the system and that is some what of a turn-off , because as a proud american and Christian who stands next to Bush , I ca n't support lyrics that scream anarchistic defiance toward towering authority figures . A divided nation can not stand -LRB- thank you Jesus and Washington -RRB- and their political views slightly obscure and mar my listening appreciation for the band . Anyway , politics aside , the disc is musically excellent . The only cuts that are just so-so involve `` Bounce '' , `` Shimmy '' and `` Science '' . The rest of the disc stacks up as a mammoth plethora of meaningful ferocity . So , while I ca n't condone the philosophy that the band has sharply imbued , I can say that this music alone is some of the best hard rock music ever written . As a Christian , I do n't find myself listening to the album any more -LRB- it 's long since been buried somewhere upstairs in one of my filing cabinets -RRB- because I object to the tarty sexual innuendo of the crass and musically underpolished `` Bounce '' and while `` Chop Suey ! '' may be the most powerfully great song of extremes ever written , I 've learned that God forsakes no one if they turn to His son . The 5 star review is given because it is a stellar musical recording . Unfortunatly , they hav n't yet invented a scrambler to change the lyrics .
 Only when I have this CD in my mouth , can I truly understand the unadulterated beauty that is `` SYSTEM OF A DOWN '' . Saliva slowly engulfing every square inch as though my body is accepting it as yet another organ . I get goose pimples when I but think of my outstretched cheeks as if ceaselessly asking for more gritty goodness . This CD is almost as comforting in one 's mouth as any digitally re-mastered work of the Velvet Fog himself .
 The two people below me do n't know what the **** they are talking about . SOAD is unlistenable ? So Aerials is unlistenable is it ? And he goes on to praise Nine Inch Nails LOL . He 's got a great sense of humour . Unlike NIN , SOAD actually has a singer that can sing in tune . They also do n't rely on samples to make music . When NIN write a song as beautiful as Chop Suey then you can come and brag until then stay the **** away from the SOAD department and go buy your morbid goth cd 's ok loser?Toxicity is the best album of the past 10 years , although Fiona Apple 's Tidal pushes it close . As I said Aerials is a stand out track , it is so melodic , I love the middle eastern melodies.SOAD 's new album Hypnotize is out early next year , until then I 'll keep listening to Toxicity because it never gets old . Also check out Steal This Album , another masterpiece . Daron Malakian is a genius , Serj Tankian is a brilliant singer , John Dolymayan is up there with Chad Smith for drums and Shavo is just plain nuts ! LOL!p.s . this album , like all their others was produced by the legendary Rick Rubin , got ta give him props too because producers really help improve the band 's songs from the original demos.Buy this album NOW !

 System of a Down has satisfied my `` I hate America '' Rock Genre for sometime , but this album takes the cake . Tracks like `` Prison Song '' and `` Deer Dance '' really get the blood flowing against your OWN COUNTRY . Others , such as `` Bounce '' and `` Needles '' need more intence listening to to fully get what these guys are saying -LRB- E.X `` Bounce '' is about Molestation -RRB- .1 . Prison Song - 5/5 - One of the most hilairous and strangly true songs on this CD . Great Lyrics and music .2 . Needles - 4/5 - Weird , but in a good way . i have yet to find the meaning of this song however . a Tapeworm ? huh ? O.O3 . Deer Dance - 4/5 - Another Great song about how america is a corupted nation . * Sigh * I love Politics4 . Jet Pilot - 3/5 - Uh . Sounded like Noise with a little bit of lyrics . They can do better , and they have done better .5 . X - 4/5 - I Liked it . Short , But I Liked it .6 . Chop Suey ! - 5/5 - One of their most reconizable songs . Very Popular . Great Lyrics and Memorable Music Video .7 . Bounce - 4/5 - a Weird Song about a girl getting molested ? Hm ... 8 . Forest - 4.5 / 5 - Very Good song . Heavy guitar and drums . Lyrics are standard SOAD stuff .9 . ATWA - 3/5 - Do what ? 10 . Science - 4/5 - Nice song . Cant say much about it though . Its a SOAD Song . Great Guitar and Lyrics , although i linger for more . .11 . Shimmy - 4/5 - Strangy , I liked this song , dispite its rapidness . Same format as ATWA and Jet Pilot .12 . Toxicity - 4.75 / 5 - You hear this on the radio even now . Awesome song about city life . I wish it were a bit fast , but other than that , it 's Great ! 13 . Psycho - 4/5 - Kind of a Creepy Song . About Crack smoking groupies .14 . Aerials - 5/5 - has `` Symbolic song '' written all over it . Great Lyrics and a great way to finish off a Great album .
 System of a Down 's release of `` Toxicity '' was a great thing for the rock industry today . This album is by far the best System record I 've heard besides their self-titled and `` Steal This Album . '' `` Toxicity '' is nothing short of perfect , every song is catchy and just brilliant . BUY THIS ALBUM TODAY !! May 17 , System releases `` Mezmorize '' part of as double disc set , hopefully it reaches the potential of `` Toxicity . ''
 This is one great record.You have song 's that talk about Prison like Prison Song , and song 's about absolutly nothing like Chop Suey.Anyway here 's A rating Guide.Prison Song - -LRB- 9-10 -RRB- . A Great Song.There is just one problem , the song slow 's down to much at some point 's . Needles - -LRB- 10-10 -RRB- . One of the best song 's on the album , because they let Darin say some lyric ; s by himself , and he 's got the coolest voice ever.Deer Dance - -LRB- 9-10 -RRB- . Good song , but not much different from Prison Song.Jet Pilot - -LRB- 7-10 -RRB- . The worst song on the album , but it 's still desent.X - -LRB- 8-10 -RRB- . It 's a really cool song.There 's just one problem , it 's to short.Chop Suey - -LRB- 10-10 -RRB- . It 's the second best song one the album.Everything is good on it from the music , to the wierdest lyric 's I 've ever heard.Bounce - -LRB- 8-10 -RRB- . It 's a desent song , but it 's not one of my favorites.Forest - -LRB- 9-10 -RRB- . Serj completly makes this song with some of the best lyric 's on any album.It 's a great song.ATWA - -LRB- 10-10 -RRB- . No idea what the title means , but it 's one of my favorite song 's . It starts you out slow , and then kick 's it in to high rear.Science - -LRB- 9-10 -RRB- . It 's hard to tell it apart from Forest.Which makes it a good song.Shimmy - -LRB- 9-10 -RRB- . Like X there 's only one problem with this song.It 's to short.Toxicity - -LRB- 10-10 -RRB- . Best song on album.I could listen to it a hundred times , and not get tired of it.Psycho - -LRB- 10-10 -RRB- . It just plain sound 's cool.Enough said.Aeirals - -LRB- 9-10 -RRB- . Very cool song , and a good change of pace.Ther 's only one problem it 's six minutes long .
 Good Album . Good for staying awake while driving . Should be used instead of SSRI 's . Not a single song that gives me the desire to fast forward through it .
 This is the best album that they came out with . Serge is my favorite from their band .
 SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO rare to come out with back to backs . I ca n't say enough good stuff about system ... not just this album all of them ... buy this and every other one ... They are probably thee best rock band in 15 years ... they NEVER dissapoint
 Sheer brilliance is what i can say to this cd ... i dont know where they came up with this but i praise them for it ... this cd is the reason i like soad .
 this is the heaviest cd ever I listened to it and the first words out of my mouth were this is the ... best cd ever best song is shimmy next chop suey next forest and last needles if you have every other cd you should buy this one or you 'll regret it
 1 . PRISON SONG : great bouncey , catchy song , with alot of drug refrences . I do n't know if its me but in some part of the song he sounds like outkast , oh well great song one of my favourites 10/102 . NEEDLES : great guitar riffs and excellent singing , especially in the middle of the song where daron sings .10 / 103 . DEER DANCE : simialar to prison song though not as fast paced .10 / 104 . JET PILOT : very repetetive but dont get me wrong it has a good chorus , and is a good song . 8/105 . X : does n't go for very long but its a song that i would like to learn the guitar tab off , and it has great singing . 10/106 . CHOPSUEY : has a great guitar and drum intro , and has the maddest chorus and guitar riff . I can really see why this was the first single from this album . 10/107 . BOUNCE : the funniest song on the album and it is very simialar to the song X. 10/108 . FOREST : the longest lasting song on the album which is good , and it is one of my favorite songs live by system of a down , and this song has a great intro and has some good sound effects through out the song . 10/109 . ATWA : i love it how this song goes from slow to fast with out warning you . Great song if you like their acoustic stuff which is the only acoustic song on the album . Oh by the way if you like this song you should get there new album steal this album , oh well great song . 10/1010 . SCIENCE : this song has the seconde best guitar riffs and has a great chorus , and there is not a single thing that bothers me with this song . 10/1011 . SHIMMY : a very fast paced wacky song with very strange lyrics . 10/1012 . TOXICITY : this song has an ok start , but i have to say the ending is incredible , and the only reason why i wont give it a ten out of ten is because the guitar is n't very heavy at the start , but any way great song . 9/1013 . PSYCHO : very strange guitar intro , and this is the wierdest song on the album in a good way , just have a listen to it from above and you will see what i mean . 10/1014 . AERIALS : the intro sounds spooky and the beginning of the singing is great , but im not to keen on the chorus being slow , but any way great song .8 / 10
 I have many albums I 've bought and listened and just really did n't ` feel ' ... Limp Bizkit did that to me with their new material , as do many bands ... Anyways , when I bought this album , I immediately ate this thing up.The layering of guitars , the schitzofrenic timimng , the oddball vocals , the thought provoking lyrics make this the most solid metal album I 've heard in a while , if not 2001 . While bands like bands like Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit were busy doing rap metal , System Of A Down spent some times writing and creating a solid metal album . And I bought this album at about the same time I bought the new Slipknot album , and I will tell you , this blows Iowa out of the water . The lyrics are not about ' I hate the world ' or ' I will take the life out of that -LSB- stuff -RSB- you call a heart ' type stuff . Instead Serj and crew wrote about pressing political issues -LRB- Prison Song -RRB- , psychotic cocaine snorting groupies -LRB- Psycho -RRB- , police bruitality -LRB- Deer Dance -RRB- , and so on.But every one of the songs is beatufily written -LRB- with the possible exception of the somewhat short and weak Bounce , my least favorite track on the album -RRB- , and has crazy timing changes , speed metal inflected drums , punk guitar power chords , and one of the best vocalists in modern rock today , all to make this solid , catchy , totally unMTV sounding record ...
 I love this cd !!!! I turly and honestly have never heard something so original and amazing . Serj and Daron have come up with some of the most memorable lyrics of alterna-rock history . Serj 's singing is at top form and Daron 's guitar mastery astounds me . He is just so GOOD at that insturment . Oh , and Chop Suey ... you just can not play that song enough . If there is one song that never , EVER gets old , it 's that one . It simultaneously beats me senseless and rocks with a harmony that is too pretty for words . I thought the first album was incredible ... wheew !!! This one breaks the mold . The whole album is flawless . years from now , this will be remembered as THE metal album of the ages.When I became the sun , I shone life into the man 's hearts !
 SOAD is definitely different from most of the popular metal acts these days , but you probably know that if you already have their first album . The best song is Science , other highlights are Aerials , Prison Song , and Chop Suey . Other songs are also good , with the exception of Psycho and Shimmy which may be good live , but are pretty boring on the album . Its worthy .
 First of all , I 'd just like to say that finds SOAD 's lyricsc `` mindless raving '' are very much mistaking . Some songs , like Jet Pilot , are bit lyrically obvious , but the rest pack some serious meaning . Another thing I 'd like to say is that some of my favorite bands are the Red Hot Chili Peppers , Sublime and the smashing pumpkins so I really was not a metal fan until I heard SOAD . There 's nothing i hate more than -LSB- bad -RSB- lyrics . Even if they 're a bit stupid , the stupidity must be artful . Bounce , for example , is actually about something not so thought provoking . However , SOAD did n't do what so many rappers do and shove it down your throat with a broom handle . They actually turned it into a METAPHOR . You hear that Ludacris , `` METAPHOR '' ! Anyway , the concept is good , the instrumentals are good , and the ltrics are also exceptional . Keep goin , SOAD !
 Toxicity is possibly the greatest CD in history in my opinion . Their song , Bounce , woul make Frank Zappa very proud . Political bands are quite scarce these days , mostly rock music today consists of sex , drugs , and pushing down old people . Prison Songs is widely known for its lyrics ... and law enforcemnt decreased while abolishing mandatory minimum sentences ! ... System of a Down out-weirded everyone for this year I think , with their strange looks and wild performances . This is not a CD you would want to pass up ! go see them at the Ozzfest !
 Most of the latest heavy-metal bands on the radio leave me unimpressed , with their similar names , similar sounds , and one-hit wonder songs . System of a Down , on the other hand , stands out with their lyrics - instead of generic depressed lyrics , they 're standing up for something . The music is tight and real heavy . I give it 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons - the lyrics tend to repeat a lot in most of the songs , and the heavy guitar parts are either single-chord rhythmic patterns or 3 - or 4-note riffs repeated in a single measure . A little more riffage a la Clutch or Corrosion of Conformity would get a fifth star from me .
 after reveiwing this cd , i discovered that system of a down not only revolutionzed modern rock ... they also created a new genre . first , all the songs on the cd sound unique . each member of the band is highlighted in each and every second of each track . john dolmayan pounds on his drums and cymbals , making each fill in and beat match perfectly with the music . shavo 's smooth bass creates a strong deep tone and Daron 's immaculate guitar skills shine on guitar creative melodies and solo 's . last but not least , serj tankian 's great voice and deep lyrics contribute the finishing touches to perfect the band . i recommend to EVERYONE to buy this cd and give it a chance . you may think it is awkward at first . but soon you will learn to grow upon it and love it . system of a down 's cd `` toxicity '' is truly a remarkable experience .
 I have never heard any other rock that sounds like SOAD , and that 's why I like Toxicity . Chop Suey ! is a good example of this , as is Psycho and Aerials -LRB- my personal favorite -RRB- . Needles and Bounce are the funny songs on the CD , but for very different reasons . Overall , very good.For someone who wants a fresh hard rock band with a completely different sound , and one that is as far away from mainstream pop as it is possible to get , buy `` Toxicity '' .
 This album is a rarity these days -- a pop album that does n't try to be anything more than a lot of fun . Certainly one of the better freshman entries from a top-40 's style band in the last few years . All the songs are fun , and although the lyrics are sometimes silly , they do n't detract from the overall song itself . The production on this album , however , leaves a lot to be desired . The music often bleeds into itself and becomes mushy . But I have no doubt this mildly popular Los Angeles band will take care of that on their next album , and will go on to become extremely successful .
 I know , most people do n't pay attention to someone under thirteen , but I 'm 12 . Starting off , I usually do not listen to heavier rock . I actually mostly listen to hip-hop . I heard Chop Suey and was determined to get this album.The songs that , to me , really stood out were : Prison Song-A great point about the government and drugs.Toxicity-This song is about Los Angeles and how most people think it 's so great , but it 's really not.Chop Suey : I love this song . But most people are offended by the `` when angels deserve to die '' part . But most people take it out of context . He says , `` I cry when angels deserve to die '' So obviously it 's not Satanic , it 's a statement.Shimmy
 Most people would n't call Toxicity Heavy Metal , because it certainly does n't sound like it . But if you like Metal , Power Rock , any kind of Rock -LRB- except for light rock -RRB- then you will like System of a Down 's Toxicity.Prison Song
 WHEN I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM I WAS SIMPLY INSLAVED BY THE VOCALS AND THE HYPNOTIC RYTHEMS OF THE BAND . AFTER I LISTENED TO THIS WORK OF ART , I SAW THE LIGHT AND I SAW THE INNERVISION DEEP INSIDE OF MY SOUL THAT WAS TRYING TO ESCPAE . THIS MASTERPIECE OF DEVIN VOCALS AND LYRICS SET MY SOUL FREE FROM THE PRISON IT WAS HELD INSIDE OF . I DEEPLY WOULD RECOMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE THAT IS TRYING TO FIND THE INNER LIGHT INSIDE THEMSELVES .
 I was down in L.A. going to Azusa race park when I passed a huge crowd of a crap load of people . I stopped by and say that SoaD was having a concert inside a motel called , sunrise or something ... i forgot , anyways it was a pretty cool concert . Also the video shoot for `` chop suey '' took place their you can see the motel in the background of the video . The motel is actually right in front of a 99cents store . Oh and surrounded with gay homelesses . -LRB- j/k ! -RRB-
 Man I dont know why everyone has to write a really long review on every song on here cause it isnt nessecarry . to make it short and sweet every song is a 10/10 on this album this is by far the best album in a long time and i hope mezmorize is right up therew with it ... / ...
 System of a Down has released a great album . The lyrics and their songs really gives these guys a sound of their own . Their lyrics can be from dead serious to downright hilarious . Needles , Prison Song , Chop Suey are three of my favorite songs . I definately recommend this CD for anyone who liked their last one .
 Two months ago , if you asked me who System of a Down was , I 'd 've not been to answer you . However , after hearing Chop Suey ! on the radio and seeing the music video , I immediately began searching for more of their music . I received the CD for my birthday , and let me say , it blows you away . From the first track through the last , the energy never drops , but actually gets higher , -LRB- which sounds impossible after hearing Prison Song , which starts this album off . -RRB- This CD could n't get louder or faster in my opinion , and Serj yelling and screaming throughout most of it gives it that edge that somehow works perfectly . If you 're looking for a band that 'll pump you up , SoaD is the band for you . Get this CD if you 're a rock fan , and you 'll love it , just as I do . Great deal .
 This awesome CD is what people have to buy to listen good music and what musicians have to buy to learn how they can take some excellent influence from System of a Down 's new album Toxicity.I wish these guys will keep making great music in the future.It starts with Prision Song passing by Needles , Chop Suey ! , ATWA , Science , and finishing with Psycho and Aerials/Arto . If you want your perfect christmas , do n't forget your perfect gift SYSTEM OF A DOWN - TOXICITY .
 What can I say that has not already been said ? This album has become a mainstay in my cd player since I bought it .
 This CD is really , really awesome . It 's not that i only like this heavy metal/rock genre . Quite frankly , i like every type of music , besides country , that is . -LRB- heh -RRB- This is a review coming a person who likes everything from Dido to Disturbed . rap , rock , whatever , i like it all . This is just a really good CD for anyone who likes any music at all and also has very good taste . Very great work from SOAD that should be enjoyed by everyone
 After a lengthy layoff of four years , System Of A Down 's second trip into the studio in 2001 produced `` Toxicity '' , an album that definitely turned out to be worth the wait . The self-titled definitely pales in comparison to this.This CD is definitely not for the faint of heart . Lead vocalist Serj Tankian sings , sure , but he also screams , yelps , howls , and does whatever else he feels like doing . The music also goes back and forth a lot between fast and slow sections . Buy it only expecting to be challenged by the back-and-forth nature of the songs . Below is my track-by-track rating :1 . Prison Song 10/10 A great way to start off the album 2 -RRB- Needles 10/10 Definitely one of my favorites off this album ... another hardcore piece . 3 -RRB- Deer Dance 8/10 I do n't like the mellow part of this song too much , but I think the heavy part is awesome . 4 -RRB- Jet Pilot 8/10 This one clocks in at a very brief 2:07 , and it is pure metal all the way . 5 -RRB- X 8/10 This one clocks in at an even more concise 1:59 , and it is about reducing reproduction . Another excellent song . 6 -RRB- Chop Suey 10/10 The single , and probably the best song instrumentally on this album . 7 -RRB- Bounce 7/10 This is my least favorite song on this album ... it seems rushed . 8 -RRB- Forest 10/10 This song is AMAZING ! Back-and-forth vocals , heavy but spellbinding , this song is a great summary of System Of A Down 's sound . 9 -RRB- ATWA 9/10 This song is a little different , very mellow in most of the song , still very good though . 10 . Science 9/10 I do n't like some of the lyrics to this song ; great instrumentally though . 11 -RRB- Shimmy 10/10 Check this one out for yourself 12 -RRB- Toxicity 7/10 Another one of the weaker songs ... still not bad . 13 -RRB- Psycho 10/10 Probably tied with Forest for best on this album . 14 -RRB- Aerials 10/10 Another mellow song in the vein of ATWA . I really like the lyrics for this one . 15 -RRB- Outro 9/10 Very mellow and not heavy at all ... but still great!Overall -135 / 150 ... easy 5 stars .
 Although recorded in a matter of weeks you can tell System Of A Down has put their hearts into this album . With songs ranging from political hypocricy , to sex & suicide , you might think `` oh just another -LRB- ... -RRB- metal album '' , but that would be far from the truth . Take the song ` bounce ' . In wich they cleverly candy coat the songs true message about sex , with lyrics about a kid and his pogo stick . Then they have their ballads like ` chop suey ' and ` arials ' wich are so gracefull you wouldnt expect the upcomming mindshaking metal . System has truly outdone themselves on this album . I hope that you will go out and get this album , its just so fantastic , & if they head to your town W / Slipknot & Ramstein On ` The Pledge Of Allegiance Tour ' , make sure your there , otherwise you are going to miss a MIND BLOWING concert
 once in a blue moon , an album comes along of such compelling nature that whatever you are doing when listening to it for the 1st time . . well . . you stop doing it because the cd you have playing is so good it stops you dead in yr tracks . it reaches out to you . speaks to you , moves you in some way . it reaches thru the speakers and says HEY STOP LISTEN TO THIS.i knew SOAD but never was thrilled with them . this album changes ALL that . i have purchased MANY cd 's in the past year but this one i shoots up in my top ten . this was an eye opener . the music is incredible . it combines death metal with slow harmony . the band cranks out a hard fast riff and then suddenly stops and changes direction into a subtle quietness . from fast and furious to moderate rock . their is a multitude of musical styles . they do not play any one style long . a measure of this into a measure of that all in a hearbeat . WONDERFUL.the lyrics cover a wide range of topics from goverment to charles manson -LRB- PRISON & ATWA -RRB- and SERJ is a GEM of a singer . he can scream , he can SING and his voice in itself is a instrument but it is so natural . he croons , he sings and i can feel it hit me through the speakers . the band is amazing . great players who command the music and whip out the best album i have heard this year . the best album i have heard in a LONG time .
 This is the deal . Best ROCK cd out this year . Nuff said .
 Their music do not necessarily please everyone
 This is good.Very good.System of a down did a fantastic first album and this is even better.Listen and learn how to play rock 'n roll ...
 I am normaly aginst selling out , but I think this is just what the mainstream needed . -LRB- Same gose with POD . -RRB- At last MTV is playing and promoting some real metal and not that gay Limp Bizket stuff or Kid Rock stuff.In my mind the most catchy and best songs on the albem are X , Chop Suey , Jet pilot , Toxicity , and the lyricily important Prison Song . Won thing I thought was cool was how System of a Down used bible lines in the lyrics of their single Chop Suey.I think their Self titeld CD is slighty better , but this to is a must and like so many others have said one of the years best CDs .
 Yes this is the best album of the new millenium so far . Yes it is even better than Slayer 's God hates us all which came out a week later . This album is so powerful that ALL the nu-metal bands only wish they had the power and kick this band has . I see promising things to come from this band . Also IMO the title track has got to be one of the best metal songs to come along in the longest time . Best songs are
 Toxicity stunned me . It was better than the immortal debut . Perfect vocals are a complement to the hard metal guitar tones . The drumming is impecabe especially on the title track , Toxicity . It 's anti mainstream and just a perfect rock album .
 i first heard chop suey ! at a dance at my high school and i began to ask around to find out who the band was . athough i head listened to the rock stations all summer , i had not heard of system of a down . the first chance i got , i went out and i bout the cd just to see what it was about.the cd is very very good , but you have to lean more toward the harder end of rock to really understand how good it is . the whole cd talks about really deep important issues and it 's very interesting the way that everything is displayed from a different angle . you can chose to either follow the lyrics of the songs or just the songs themselves . either way this cd is worth buying .
 This CD , simply put , is a fantastic album . It is one of the few CDs ever put out by anyone -LRB- like Linkin Park -RRB- in which I like every single song . Every song is so original , funny , and no two songs sound alike . The first song I ever heard by SOAD was Chop Suey , and from then , I was hooked ! I took a gamble on buying the album , and am in now way dissapointed , it was worth every penny ! To put it in a better way , there are 14 songs on the CD , the best ones are
 System of A Down is the most politicaly charged band out there at this moment in time . Few bands have had the ability to capture the ferocity of politics that S.O.A.D. employ . TOXICITY is in no way an exception . All of the songs have a point to make , and that point is made with intensity . `` ATWA '' is a beautifully orchestrated song on the environmental views of one Charles Manson and at times one can not feel a little mournful . Do not dismiss them however as just a political band , but rather think of them as a ` heavy mental ' band for the politically aware .
 I like SOAD because their music is so different from anything . `` Chop Suey ! '' Is actually not one of my favorite songs here . I think `` Prison Song '' is the best , and i like `` Toxicity '' and `` Forest '' . Very original to say the least ... I do n't even listen to the song Chop Suey , because I 'm sick of hearing it now . But the rest of the songs are worth it . Just because they got overly popular on MTV doesnt mean theyre bad . Usually it does though . ; /
 This album is the best album of the new year . After System of a Down 's first , extremely heavy album , which was itself a beautiful album , I was excited to pick this one up after hearing the radio single , Chop Suey ! . After listening to this CD , it is obvious that SOAD 's sophomore effort is better than their first , and their radio single was outdone by a number of other songs . Overall , the lighter songs are better , but even they have bridges between heavy and melodic and beautiful . The Armenian band 's close proximity to the MidEast is shown through the album , especially on songs such as Science & the 2nd part of Aerials . Overall a brilliant effort - best songs are ATWA , Toxicity , Aerials , Science , and Chop Suey ! . Oh and definitely the most beautiful part of the album is the bridge of Deer Dance - they should write an instrumental based on that solo .
 What can I say ? Amazing ? Unbelieveable ? The best of the year ? The first album is great , but so is this one . Great and a little bit more . Chop Suey is one of the most beautiful songs Ive ever heard . And the video for this one is really cool . One of the best albuns of the year , just as POD 's Satellite .
 this cd represents the future of what metal will sound like . screw everybody that says , `` chop suey is the best song ! '' true , its a great single , but theres a lot more to system of down than its singles . get this and their old self-titled album . other albums to check out slipknot iowa , staticx wisconsin death trip , and mudvayne LD 50 .
 I have had the cd for about a week . What I have been able to hear is extremely creative . They are not in some trite genre . They are creating something exciting and new . I think their next album will be something great . They are a little rough but the potential is amazing . The melodies are very infectious . Very clean and aggressive guitar and bass work . The percussion is very much like early sepeltura . Very tribal . I think everyone will being hearing alot more from this band in the future . I think if you like punk , metal , hard rock , or any kind of music with distorted guitar work this album is a must have . If you are a musician then it like hearing metallica in 81 or Smashing pumpkins in 91 . The musicianship scares you its so fresh and creative . Well its 01 and heres your band .
 I give this awesome CD 5 stars , because , I think System Of a down did a great job on this cd . I love the songs Needles , and Chop Suey ! .
 When i heard system of a downs first cd i loved it but there were a few tracks that i really did n't care for . the new cd however i have fell in love with every song . it 's heavy it 's waltzy it 's everything you 've ever dreamed of in a system of a down cd . . if you like system of a down i 'd deffinatly tell you to buy this cd !!!!!!
 When I first bought this album , I was a bit afraid that it would be just screaming and very redundant . Instead , it turned out to be a high quality and musically diverse album . I love Serji 's voice in all aspects , whether it be his screaming or his singing . Also , there is hardly any cussing on the album which I think is something rare and great for are day and age . After buying this album , I have become a big System of a Down fan , and hope that you will go out and buy this great cd so you can experience this musical masterpiece !
 HOLY COW ! Along with God Hates Us All from Slayer , this is the album of the year for 2001 ! This CD has such dimension to it ... at first it seemed weird , but after about 5 listens you really understand how great it is . Thumbs up ... WAY UP !
 This is the best cd i have ever heard . All the songs on this cd are amazing . They range from the lyrics making absolutely no sense -LRB- Jet Pilot -RRB- to being on of the most emotional songs i have ever heard -LRB- Chop Suey ! -RRB- . Serj Tankian has the weirdest voice but it fits perfectly with their music . If I compared these guys to my other favorite bands ; Slipknot , Soulfly , Slayer , Mudvayne , and Korn , these guys are the most tolerable . Stand out tracks -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- are ; Prison Song , Needles , Deer Dance , Jet Pilot , X , Chop Suey ! , Bounce , ATWA , Shimmy , Toxicity , and Psycho .
 but SOAD are really a different band . They 're as hard and heavy as any other band , but they do something many other ` metal ' bands do n't - they add melody , intelligent lyrics , and melody-shifting , shape forming music . I do n't want to get too bogged down , but this is , to me , relaxing music . I have all the lyrics and music shifts memorized , so it 's just something to cycle through when I 'm relaxing . The only downfall is that if you listen to it too much , it gets ... boring . There are 14 songs , but the album still is only like 40 minutes long , so it does n't take long for it to grate on your nerves . But it 's still a lot better than Drowning Pool or Slipknot or POD , so I 'd give it a buy .
 Right up there with Tool 's LATERALUS and Maiden 's BRAVE NEW WORLD as the decade 's finest in metal thus far . Just friggin ' essential . Nuff said .
 This is what fans of heavy music need to be listening to . SoAD 's first cd was just incredible , with explorative guitar riffs and outstanding lyrics , but System beat the sophomore jinx with an even more amazing disc . Most band 's 2nd cd -LRB- ... -RRB- , but this is one of the few bands that have talent . Serj 's vocals are awesome , he can go from a polital tune to a song about pogo sticks . Finally , a band with worthwhile political views -LRB- Zach de la Rocha -LRB- ... -RRB- -RRB- . even if you dont agree with system , they still have a sense of ` normalness ' to them that is tolerable . i respect every member of the band , and think every1 has the right to their own opinion . hey , even i dont agree with some of system 's views , and they still give a good name to `` political rock '' I went to see system at ozzfest , and banged my head to every second of every song , loved every minute of it , woke up the next morning , and could n't move my head . But , hey , for system it was worth it .
 Wow ! When I first popped this cd into my stereo , I was amazed ! I did n't think a CD could ever be so great ! Right from the start , their first song `` Prison Song '' gets you going right away!As you move to track number six , `` Chop Suey ! '' , it makes you jump around ! All of the tracks on this CD are great . Most CDs have about 3/4 or 1/2 of good songs , then a few are bad , but not System ! ALL of the songs are great ! System has tied for first place on my top list with Rage Against The Machine . The two best groups ever , none of either groups have any songs that 'll let you down . If your looking for a CD that 's just awesome , buy System of a Down ! This music will make your head bobb for the whole CD !
 Listen to it for what 's wrong . This may sound absurd , but what 's right with `` Toxicity '' is what 's wrong . The extremely odd signature changes , the weird voice that Sarje puts forward , and the reverse genious-genious guitar that 's played make this record incredible . This is just hard-core head-banging music at it 's best . Pick this one up or some heart stopping music .
 One of the best ones in my collection . If you do n't like this cd , it 's your loss .
 hey you see me pictures crazy all the world I 've seen before me passing by , i have nuthing to gain to lose all the world I 've seen before me passing by , you dont care bout how i feel - ATWA - system of a down - any band that can write a possitive song about somethin that charles manson did -LRB- ATWA is AIR TREES WATER ANIMALS a anti pollution act that was created by manson -RRB- has got to be a great band . not to meantion songs like prison song , tapeworm , pushing little children , jet pilot , X , chop suey , pogo , the forrest , atwa , science , shimmy , toxicity , psycho , and ariels . man thats enuf said . l8er peace
 The first time I heard this album I was blown away by the great songs . `` Prison Song '' is an excellent starter for this album . Then it moves on to the disturbing sounds of `` Needles , '' which althouh scary , is a very good song . `` Deer Dance '' and `` Jet Pilot '' to me sound very similar but both solid . `` X '' is one of the shortest songs on the album but is sweet . At the very beginning of `` Chop Suey '' you can barely hear Serj say , `` We 're rolling suicide , '' which adds to the effect of the track . I do n't like the album version of `` Bounce '' as much as I like the live `` Pledge of Allegiance '' tour version , but nonetheless it 's one of my favorites . I like Serj 's screams on `` Forest . '' `` Atwa '' is in my opinion the best track on this fantastic album . `` Science , Shimmy and Toxicity '' are all outstanding . `` Psycho '' is disturbing '' and `` Aerials '' is epic .
 Those two words sum up this cd perfectly . All of the songs have insane lyrics attached to them with some incredibly heavy hard-hitting music , though sometimes mellower parts do come through . I just got it yesterday and I already love it . It has great rock out moments that are some of the best heavy metal riffs I 've ever heard , but then it also has many songs that could be qualified as `` pretty '' . Of course the singles are great , but all the songs are equally great as well . This is just a refreshingly awesome cd that everyone should buy , and definitely stands out from the rest of the muck being released nowadays . This has even got me interested in buying their other 2 albums as well , their self-titled one from 98 and their new Steal This Album released a few weeks ago . Since Toxicity is so great I can only imagine how good those two will be also if I end up getting them . But in the meanwhile I will definitely be playing this one to death for sure . Thanks System for a memorable cd and here 's hoping you never change your ways .
 This album is n't quite as good as `` Steal this Album '' or `` System of a Down '' but it comes pretty damn close . I hear X getting a lot of bad comments but it 's actually one of my favorite songs . For me ` Atwa ' , ` Needles ' , and ` Forest ' were the best songs on the CD , so if you buy it for any song , buy it for those . The only song that was weak was ` Psycho ' .
 This album has alot of twists and turns in it that keep you hanging on and never gets boring , from the first beat of `` Prison Song '' to the last wierd sound at the ensd of `` Aerials '' , this album has a lot of interesting music . the fact that these guys are from Armenia is even better , because Daron -LRB- guitar -RRB- adds tons of textures with various world music-sounding licks . I would definitely reccomend this to any serious Nu-Metal fan that is looking for something new !
 First of all Karlmarx needs to get la * d by someone older the 10 years old and he also should stop sucking RATM 's d * ck I liked RATM until karlmarx killed them by bitching because SOAD is way better but is denying so get a life karlmarx you have so much water in your head that if you crack it open everyone on earth will drown ... Now the real soad review it is overall a good CD every song is great I reccomend it to a heavy metal fan that likes SOAD . it is their heaviest CD that I have I do n't have their new album mezmerize tho I want it . You would be listening to this CD for 2 years I got this in 2003 and I still listen to it SO BUY IT NOW !!!
 Well , I 'll review the CD by song breakdown .1 . Prison Song - 8/10 Funny song ... 2 . Needles - 9/10 Good , yet confusing ... 3 . Deer Dance - 10/10 Nice and political .4 . Jet Pilot - 5/10 What are you yelling about , Mr. Tankian ? I just do n't get it ! 5 . X - 7/10 Ehhh ... 6 . Chop Suey - 10000/10 Best song on the album .7 . Bounce - 6/10 Serj might have been hyper when he wrote this ... 8 . Forest - 8/10 It 's OK .9 . ATWA - 1000/10 The second best song on the album .10 . Science - 7/10 -LRB- see X -RRB- 11 . Shimmy - 5/10 -LRB- see Jet Pilot -RRB- 12 . Toxicity - 9/10 Pretty good .13 . Psycho - 9/10 Funny song about psycho druggies .14 . Aerials - 9/10 Nice , slow song , but it 's a little confusing.Overall , I give the CD a 8/10 . I would recommend this CD to people who have just heard of SOAD . But I still think Mezmerize is better ...
 This CD is the best I 've heard by SOAD and possibly the best I 've heard . As soon as I listened to each and every song I fell in love . Amazing vocals , music and lyrics . This was actually the CD that got me into SOAD and now I ca n't get enough of them . `` Aerials '' , the last song on the CD , is truly amazing and by far the bset I 've ever heard . It has great sound and incredibly great lyrics . If you are a fan of SOAD , why are you here reading these reviews ? Go out and buy it !! And if you are n't and just like rock and/or metal , no need to think twice , get it !

 Through it memorably debuted at No. 1 on September 11 , 2001 , System Of A Down 's second album is a snapshot of American in the wake of 9/11 - angry , manic , paranoid , and confused , yet , still searching for flashes of magic in daily existence .
 1 . Prison Song
 One must acquire a taste for the thrashy System of a Down to fully appreciate the entire album . But once one does sit down and listen to ` Toxicity ' with no expectations from their previous or latter album , ` Toxicity ' proves to be a truly enlightening experience . It 's nice to know that some bands out there still possess some form of originality . You ca n't really compare System of a Down to any others of the genre because the start/stop thrash style along with the crunchy guitar/bass riffs and spastic drumming offer a rare head-banging enjoyment . The instrumentation allows for Serj Tankian 's voice to really shine . His voice perfectly suits the album 's fast paced , multiple-personalitied style . On one hand he roars over brutal riffs , but then instantaneously switches to a more subdued melodic singing style . This is clearly shown on lead single , ` Chop Suey ' . The album is well produced , every song is worth repeating and cleverly leads into the fairly mellow ending , ` Aeriels ' , where the band 's Armenian roots really shine.Bottom Line
 This is a tremendous album and can not be matched . This is how the true system of a down sounds and how they should sound forever . Phyco is funny and the best song on the whole album and the best System song ever . Recommended for any rock fan .
 I am a huge System of a Down fan . I have all their albums and eps as well as Serart and Kittens for Christian . But , I am also a huge metal fan . I can honestly say that this is hands down , one of the top 5 -LRB- at least -RRB- metal albums of our time !! Serj is one of the most amazing poets that transferred over to music , because his lyrics are honest-to-god opinions and his voice can carry into a wide variety of tones . Daron is my idol and rightfully so ; he is an extremely great guitarists and has the attitude that music is fun and not a obstacle on the way to success . Shavo and John are technical wizards and have a great repore with each other.If the singles , Toxicity , Aerials and Chop Suey are n't enough to spark your interest , than Deer Dance , Science and Forest should give you a good enough reason . Any metal fan should have this album in their collection or they 're missing out . Rap fans will also like Serj 's rap-style versing as well . This will not be a purchase you 'll forget .
 When the first single came out , `` Chop Suey , '' I was n't really feeling it at first , I had heard of these guys but never really heard their music before , but then that song just grew on me . I checked out the album and it overwhelemed me , these guys can bring the noise , and they bring it hard and heavy . If you 're into fast , loud , blow speakers up music , this is the perfect album.standout tracks
 This is without a doubt one of the best metal albums of the last 15 years . I only like 2 or 3 of the Nu-Metal bands but I love System Of A Down , I own all their albums and this is the best of them ! The first album was amazing and this is better and trust me that is saying a whole lot , this is also one of the best concept albums of all time , this is the bands take on L.A. and the U.S.A. in general and really its right on the money , Malakein is a great guitar player he is about the same a Adam Jones of Tool , and Serj is a great vocalist , the Drummer is over the top , and the bass player is really tight along with the drummer . All the songs on Toxicity have a massage well except for maybe ` bounce . ' All the songs are great they all have a great arrangment , and great chorus ' this is truly one of the better albums I have heard in a really , really long time ! You will love this album , I know trust me and belive the hype . I know people who like pop and stuff like that , and they really love this album and the band as well , System is one of the better bands around today and you are really missing out if your not listening , so pick this up you owe it to yourself !
 Toxicity is a classic Metal album that you will listen to again and again . There should be no doubt in your mind when it comes to puchasing this CD . It 's just too good to say no to .
 I 'll admit it , the first time I listened to this CD , I hated it . Absolutely loathed it . The only songs I liked on it at that time where `` Chop Suey ! '' and `` Toxicity . '' I tried to listen to it again a few months later , and could n't even get past the first song . But last night I popped it in yet again , giving it basically its last chance.Third time 's a charm , eh?Now I really , really like this CD . There is n't a single song I do n't like -LRB- although `` Aerials '' is probably my least favorite ; I did n't like it as a single -RRB- . I ca n't even pick the standouts -- every song is great . `` Toxicity '' still remains my favorite song on the album , however -- amazing all around.However , I know System of a Down is not for everybody . My brother , for example , hates them , and apparently so do other reviewers on this site . But there are also quite a few reviews in Toxicity 's favor . Basically , you have to pick it up and decide for yourself . But in my opinion , a great album .
 System of a Down is a great band because unlike everyone else their sound is so original . You ca n't compare them to any other band . Their lyrics are meaningful and are often humorous . This band is fast and loud and will make you crank it up and slam your head .
 All i can really say about this cd is CHOP SUEY ! This is the first album ive actually got of System but iv heard a lot more . Chop Suey being my favorite song i got the cd and the quality was better than the first time i heard it . Aerials was awesome tho i do have to say that the forest noises afterwards were a bit unnesesary . but cool ! Needles one of their best songs especialy the part when he does the solo . then u got Forest FIRST TIME hearing it i played it over and over and over and over ... and over again . ATWA and Science were the same . it took time getting used to Shimmy and X. Deer Dance YA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i have to say the firt time watching Chop Suey ! was like watching The Tick on fox . it was wierd and F**ked up but I coudnt stop watching it like a disease it keeps growing and growing spreading through my Sytem . i cant wait for their next album and i just cant believe how good they are yet iv been listening to them for a year . System and Fear Factory = MY TWO FAVORITE BANDS .
 Following the release of System Of A Down 's first album in 1998 , they come back in the studio in 2001 to record their new album `` Toxicity '' , and here it is . Their music , their style and their make-up is unique , i seriously think nobody else sounds and acts like them , even on stage.Their are a few songs on this album that really stand out , such as the single `` Chop Suey ! '' , really energetic , very unique sound , and very melodic ending . A real masterpiece ! `` Aerials '' , one of the singles on this album , it 's also the only song that is n't really energetic . This song has a really melodic tune , demonstrates Serj 's and Daron 's impressive singing in the middle.In `` Deer Dance '' , Daron plays an impressive guitar solo in the middle , that 's makes the song more memorable . In the song `` X '' , it really gives you a `` what the hell is this ? '' feeling , the lyrics do n't make any sense , and less than 2 minutes.In the song `` Toxicity '' , it 's probably a single too , i do n't know . It features an impressive drum part from John at the beggining and between the whole song . A really energetic song , but not as quite as good as `` Chop Suey `` Good Job , SOAD
 This is one of the best albums I have ever heard as all the elements of a good cd are all there . The cd has its soft and hard parts , the lyrics are at times amusing -LRB- Bounce -RRB- and at times meaningful -LRB- Chop Suey -RRB- and extremely well written . The band is fantastic and play some unbelievable music . The drummer is fantastic and the guitars and bass are absolutely awesome ! The vocalist , Serj , has a fantastic voice and uses it in both a heavier way and a softer singing voice.Every song on this album is perfect and this is one of those cd 's where you can play the whole album over and over again without skipping a track . Some of the many highlights are Chop Suey ! , Aerials , Toxicity , Bounce , Shimmy and Prison Song .
 Amazing . Nothing on this album is positive , but Serj screaming , blaring guitars , heavy drumming and fast bass playing all add up to ultimate heavy metal . Song 's like X and Prison song prove plitical points and are more fast paced then most of the rest of the album . Prison song opens with a killer 45 second guitar and drum riff , only interrupted by serj whispering : `` there trying to build a prison . '' Chop Suey ! is a killer track which is somewhat staind style swerving in and out of acoustic and amped guitar riffs . Toxicity , the title track on this album is pure heavy metal , and will be pure delight to any heavy metal fan . Deer Dance talks political again about how american goverment `` push the weak around '' , and is once again captivating because of Malakian 's killer heavy metal guitar talent during the choruses . Leaving this albums only comment : any heavy metal , nu-metal or rock fan should buy it soon ! Favorite songs : Prison Song , Toxicity , Chop Suey ! , X and Deer Dance .
 I love this friggin CD . It has to be one of the best follow-ups I 've heard for a while , right along the lines of Slipknot
 I have ' t read all of the reviews out there for this album but i am sure that there can not be much left unsaid ... Speaking as someone who is fed up with the over produced offerings of so called `` Nu-metal '' i can say that this is truly a step above filled with Insane chord progressions and arpeggios and wait you can actually make out the Bass guitar part ... wow ... and vocals that send shivers down my spine and raise the hairs on the back of my neck . I wait with bated breath for a follow up !!
 OMG ! I am in love with a CD . This is an amazing mix of ranting lyrics and outstanding musicality . Every song makes a point about our world and it 's faults . The preaching voice of Tankian blocks out everything else.After owning SOAD 's first album which I listen to nonstop , I thought I should try out their new album Toxicity . I was completely blown away . This is the best music purchase I have ever made . What are you doing sitting here reading my review ?? GO BUY THIS CD !!!
 This album is just pure genius.Every single song is incredibly wonderful . The style is so rhythmical and so emotional . It sounds wonderfully produced , obviously , as the co-producer is Rick Rubin -LRB- who has worked with the Red Hot Chili Peppers -RRB- . Everything is perfect . Including the almost inaudible overtones in the song `` Chop Suey ! '' during the verses in the sudden silences . Even those sound perfect . Everything is perfect.I made myself a `` home-made '' version of this CD a few months back , but I was n't satisfied . So I went out and bought it yesterday while it was on sale and I can finally rest easy knowing that I have Toxicity in the highest quality I can possibly have . It 's extremely worth the money . You will not be disappointed . This is just as good , if not better , than System of a Down 's first album .
 SYSTEM OF A DOWN 's TOXICITY is the greatest hard rock album of 2001 and System Of A Down is one of the best bands out of the so called `` NU-METAL '' scene . This is a great album because it is heavy and fast and has meaning . System Of A Down is a Excellent band . My favorite songs on this album are : NeedlesDeer DanceChop SueyBounceForestToxicityPsychoAerials
 SOAD are one talented band definitley look out for these guys they are gon na go far in the metal industry ! This is an excellent album and it rocks and is pretty good at producing mellow music also ! Anyway I would describe the band as a cross between Slipknot and Nirvana , but that is just me . This album is not perfect -LRB- perfect being every track is good -RRB- but it is close . I reccomend you check out this album if you like intelligent hard rock .
 System of a Down is one of the best bands ive heard in a long time . i really like the song deer dance because of how they sing about the government of an unamed country control the people lives . and how there is no peice because of the government . another song i really like is aerials , but i dont really know what they are singing about and what is the music video about ??? all the songs are awsome and i could tell u something about all of them but im probably boring u with my rambling on and on so i guess ill end it here and now .
 This , like their first album , is gon na be one of those CD 's you end up liking alot but you really do n't know why . For someone who does n't listen to alot of different kinds of music , or for someone who is expecting 14 tracks of `` Chop Suey '' are going to be in for a surprise . System of a Down are definately not your average metal band . With songs about horses , pogo sticks , and tapeworms , you may be left to wonder if they even have any musical direction . The music clearly shows that they do . And there are some songs with intelligent lyrics such as `` Forest '' and `` Prison Song '' -LRB- which has an awesome message -RRB- . The singer can sing well when he wants to , but he does n't really want to much so you 'll have to deal with that . `` Aerials '' is another great song and `` Toxicity '' has lots of different cool beats to it . If you like metal that is n't TOO heavy but is really different in it 's own way , do n't pass this up . Get their first CD too . In fact , get it first .
 Toxicity is one of the standout albums that i have in my music collection . When I first heard of System Of A Down , i brushed them off as a group that were cahing in on the craze that was sweeping the world , unitl my friend lent me their album . The standout tracks are Toxicity -LRB- my favourite track on the album and one of the best songs that I have ever heard -RRB- , Aerials , Pogo , Needles -LRB- for comedy reasons -RRB- , Chop Suey and Psycho . Toxicity is an album taht you will want to listen to over and over again without getting bored .
 This CD is simply awesome . There is n't a single song that I skip when I listen to it . Solid , heavy guitar riffs with good bass and drums add to the voices that can hit just about every note humanly possible . High notes , low notes , fast music , slow music , everything song makes me want to jump around . Both CDs are definately worth buying and a must-have in my opinion .
 I have recently gotten into SOAD and hard rock in general ... years after adolescence . I feel like these guys are a healthy outlet for my rage against the neo-con right wing direction our poor country seems to be going . This album 's first three songs really pump me up . For the most part SOAD is not boring repetitive -LSB- ... -RSB- like much of hard rock and generally the lyrics are meaningful with some exceptions . Serg 's powerful voice gives chills at times . A great album to crank up your kickbox routine , annoy Jesus-freaks , and non-violently expend some warranted pent-up anger .
 This is my favorite System of a Down album . It 's got several singles you 've probably heard on the radio , and a few others that I think are even better than those . Unlike many albums I 've purchased in recent years , there 's not a loser on this disc . It 's well worth the price .
 Along with their self titled album , these two are the best albums I have heard ever by any group .
 i love system of a down . im a huge fan . i really recomend buying this album . if your new to system and you have heard the first album , then you should really buy this album . every song is enjoyable .
 Toxicity is an ultra rare type of album which you like all tracks in the CD . System of a Down -LRB- or SOAD -RRB- has to be the best band ever , their confusing and extroadonary songs are masterpieces . Well , here we go :1 -RRB- Prison Song 10/10
 Toxicity , an attack on government corruption , was the number one seller the week of September 11th . That this was the medicine for so many people in such a difficult time should tell you in itself that this is a brilliant , powerful , climactic album . But if it is n't , then here I be . System of a Down 's first album -LRB- self-titled -RRB- was clamorous in it 's nature . Toxicity , however , addresses the band 's problems with society in a more melodious , haunting manner . It does start off a bit noisy with songs like `` Prison Song '' and `` Jet Pilot '' , but takes an unexpected turn starting with the album 's first single `` Chop Suey '' and continuing with songs such as `` Toxicity '' and the astronomical hit `` Aerials '' which at one point reached number one on the charts . Also , backup singer Daron Malakian makes his presence felt a bit more on this album.My views on each song individually -- 1 . Prison Song -LRB- 5/5 -RRB- Great song about the corruption in prisons today . It also attacks the criminal nature of America and over-sentencing .2 . Needles -LRB- 5/5 -RRB- Opening with pure noise produced by it seems all of the instruments in SOAD 's arsenal , this song is brilliant in it 's eccentric nature . Serj Tankian screams to you `` pull the tape worm out of your ass '' because it is controlling you .3 . Deer Dance -LRB- 5/5 -RRB- A song about police brutality . It speaks of `` pushing little kids with their fully-automatics '' and beating on the weak and poor . Haunting song , it is beautifully constructed .4 . Jet Pilot -LRB- 3/5 -RRB- One of the weakest songs on the album -LRB- and there are n't many -RRB- . Very repetitive and seemingly of no significant substance .5 . X -LRB- 4/5 -RRB- Another very repetitive song but this one at least attempts to have a message that makes sense . Serj screams at us that `` we do n't need to multiply '' , speaking of course of the world 's obscene over-population .6 . Chop Suey -LRB- 5/5 -RRB- On an album full of brilliant songs , this one seems to stand above all others in it 's bizarre nature . The opening beat seems to hypnotize us and then draw us in . Then Tankian blasts us with a strong chorus , `` Wake up ! Grab a brush/put on a little makeup . etc. . . '' Then he drops into a ballad singing `` I do n't think you trust in my self-righteous suicide/I cry when angels deserve to DIIIIIIIIEEEEEEE !!!!!! '' It is amazing .7 . Bounce -LRB- 3.5 / 5 -RRB- Another one of the album 's few weak points . But perhaps this one is necessary . Despite being utterly ridiculous , it seems to hold some unknown secret that we wish to unlock . In this way , we are drawn to it , and we find ourselves bouncing to the beat where ever we are ... . in the car , in the house or on a street corner waiting for the `` WALK '' sign .8 . Forest -LRB- 5/5 -RRB- A very middle-eastern sounding opening leading into a heavy dosage of drums and bass . A bit confusing in it 's meaning , it still holds our attention . We want to be walking through the forest with Serj seeking what he is , whatever that may be .9 . Atwa -LRB- 5/5 -RRB- Starting slow , Serj and Daron almost whisper `` Hey you see me , pictures crazy . All the world I 've seen before me passing by . '' Then a brief explosion of noise followed by the soft haunting whispers again . The song follows this theme through a few times , accumulating more and more music behind it as it goes .10 . Science -LRB- 5/5 -RRB- An attack on the fact that we have abandoned all natural beliefs and cures for science which in it 's addictive nature has proven to be poisonous to us all . Serj 's chanting of `` Spirit moves through all things '' feels almost to be a remedy .11 . Shimmy -LRB- 4/5 -RRB- It starts by adding a new sound every ten seconds and then we hear Serj , `` Education , Fornication , Innuendo ! '' At this point in the album we have grown tired of the same noise , but we are still intrigued by Tankian 's message .12 . Toxicity -LRB- 5/5 -RRB- Another one of the brilliant songs off the album , from which it got it 's name . Haunting , creepy song in it 's tone . It certainly makes you think about what our world has become - corrupt , without order and poisoned by government and greed .13 . Psycho -LRB- A low rumbling begins and then you hear what is undoubtedly a rip-off of the famous `` re-re-re-re '' from the movie `` Psycho . '' The song is about groupies who are so hopped up on coke that they have become psychotic in their obsession .14 . Aerials -LRB- 5/5 -RRB- Along with Chop Suey , this is my favorite song on the album . And by following Psycho and leading into Arto , Aerials is by far the most haunting song from the album . Serj , with his amazing voice compares life to a waterfall and how we want something but are not willing to give up anything to get it . Pure greed is all it is .14.5 Arto -LRB- 5/5 -RRB- Technically I suppose this is a hidden track since it is not listed on the cover . Ritualistic is what comes to mind after listening to it once through . Hearing the band chanting `` A Shumba Wumba '' over and over again . As you near the end you hear screams which seems to be the human sacrifice that we have made for the world we live in now.This is by far the greatest album I have ever heard . SOAD 's new stuff is fantastic , but it pales in comparison to this masterpiece we call Toxicity.Peace to all . No exceptions !
 When I first heard Chop Suey ! , I thought it was so unbelievably bad , I laughed my butt off . I dismissed SoaD as `` just another crappy nu-metal band . '' I could n't have been more wrong . These guys take all the best things about nu-metal ... wait there are no good things about nu-metal . First of all , I 'd like to say that I am not a fan of crap like Audioslave/Foo Fighters/Nickelback/Linkin Park/Seether/Mudvayne / whatever friggin else the radio is playing . I am a fan of early Metallica , Van Halen , early Judas Priest , early Def Leppard , early AC/DC -LRB- most bands do n't get better with age -RRB- , Deep Purple , Led Zeppelin , the Scorpions , and everything else that is good in the metal world . I want to be a singer , and I can not stand bands with crap singers . System of a Down appeals to me because they 're something different from all the bands mixing Creed with Korn or whatever . They write songs that are catchy , almost beautiful , and whether Serj is crooning or death-metal growling , he 's always interesting.A small note here
 From the opening strums of Prison song to the Middle eastren ending of Aerials Systems Toxicity is a soilid cd . Not quite as good as the Self Titled cd -LRB- which is probely my personal favorite -RRB- but what is . The witty lyrics of their songs mixed with the amazing bass playing and exceptional singing of Serj Tankianin makes this a solid cd from start to finish . If you dont allready own this exceptional cd i would strongly suggest getting it right away
 i wrote a review to this one a while back but i must not have saved it.EVERY SONG ON THIS CD GETS A 5/5 BUT NOT THE SONG X IT GETS A 4.5 / 5 the lyrics are very good in this cd prolly the best lyrics they have ever done . . if your an soad fan then you must buy this cd there is no time to wait
 by far systems best album the power and the passion that they put into the songs are amazing this album is not gon na leave you bored alot better than steal this album self titled and mezmorized favorite songs chop suey thats a given since thats one of the greatest songs ever written toxicity and arials
 This album is one of the best albums I have in my collection . There is beautiful singing by Serj , awesome guitar playing by daron , killer bass by shavo , and the best damn drumming dy john . I 'll give u a rundown on the tracks :1 . Prison Song -- 10/10 -- very killer intro song . Great way to open a cd by yelling `` THERE TRYING TO BUILD A PRISON !! `` 2 . Needles -- 10/10 -- Very Clever Song . Again , the lyrics capture the listner .3 . Deer Dance -- 8/10 -- An O.K. song but has nice lyrics -LRB- which relate to me in a way -RRB- 4 . Jet Pilot -- 9/10 -- just like my rating , almost good .5 . X -- 12/10 -- I , to this day , have not found anything this kick ass . Nothing beats the insanely heavy chords Daron beats out of his guitar , and john beating the $ # ! % out of his cymbals .6 . Chop Suey -- 12/10 -- SOAD 's crowning achievment . This is the song that got the band really recognized .7 . Bounce -- 8.5 / 10 -- Honestly , one I skip by often , but it is a good listening to if you are in the right mood .8 . Forest -- 10/10 -- One of the best in my opinion . It has a really headbanging chorus , and a really neat bridge .9 . ATWA -- 10/10 -- ATWA standa for Air , Trees , Water , Air . This song is very powerful . It is a song about Charles Manson . Not his killing , but how he might have seen the world .10 . Science -- 9/10 -- ... Ehhhhh . An O.K. song but nice lyrics .11 . Shimmy -- 11/10 -- Makes me laugh . It is a really cool song to listen to , and if you look up the words in the dictionary , you might than understand what he is saying -LRB- I know I did ! -RRB- 12 . Toxicity -- 12/10 -- A very good choice to name an album after13 Psycho -- 10/10 -- When I first bought the cd , I did n't like the song because of the techno beginning . When I listened to it whole , I was Amazed .14 . Aerials -- 15/10 -- Spellbinding . SOAD always makes kick ass outro songs . This is a work of art , poetry , and craft . This is their best song out of every one they have made . Listen to this first and you will be come instantly hooked.I hope you will buy this cd . You ca n't stop listening to it once you do .
 I am disapointed with some of the reviewers of this CD . IT is by no means a perfect CD , it is not as heavy as there first , and is not as musically diverse as Steal this album . The album opens strong with Prison Song , which is basically a rant AGANIST drug dealers and the prison system . The Next few songs are decent , but CHop Suey , Forest , ATWA , and SCIENCE are excellent . Serj 's Vocals and the Guitar Chords get a bit repitive from time to time , but the album is solid . I am very disapointed that some reveiwers have left a comment such as `` not music '' ... i can see that system is not for everyone , but of all the Metal bands today , system is one of the most musically diverse bands there is . I love Black Sabbath , along with led zeppelin , the who , the beatles , Pink Floyd , and ... beethoven ... and i cant see how any of those artists are any more or less music than system . A rebbutal to the reviewer how titler his review system of a turban , that is the most RACIST , IGNORANT PIECE OF S *** that i have ever read . He asserts that system of a down supports terrorism , and that they hate america and christianity . One major problem with the logic is that some of the band is christian , as the are from armenia , a CHRISTIAN COUNTRY . The review goes on to say that the line `` the toxicity in the city '' refers to anthrax ... this is logically impossible because the album came out before 9-11 and the songs were written well before than . The reviewer is obviously racist , and probably is one of the people who thinks all muslims are terrorits , just because of the events of a small minority .
 This CD is ABSOLUTELY - perfect ! However , I 'll review it in pieces as it is quite ... separated . ; -RRB- 1 . Prison Song - Weird begining . A veeeery fast song , which is of their early production.Good lyrics , though . Okay . -LRB- 3/5 -RRB- 2 . Needles - Beter than the first one . Terrific lyrics , were getting even some musical talent here ... -LRB- 3.5 / 5 -RRB- 3 . Deer Dance - cool protest on America . -LRB- muhahahahaa -RRB- good lyrics , better better beeeeeeeetttter music . -LRB- 4/5 -RRB- 4 . Jet pilot - Wow . That 's what i call fast . A weird song , i 've sometimes written these in school . ;-RRB- -LRB- 3/5 -RRB- 5 . X - this is the first time i 've heard a GOOD band go `` diiiiiiiieeeeeee '' . A short piece , boring lyrics . -LRB- 3/5 -RRB- 6 . Chop Suey ! - ... OH MY GOD ! perfect lyrics combined with an OK heavy style guitar . I just keep singing along in the end . -LRB- 543859378/5 -RRB- 7 . Bounce - these guys sure can have fun . Kinky lyrics ... okay . -LRB- 3.5 / 5 -RRB- 8 . Forest - another OH MY GOD here . perfect lyrics -LRB- again -RRB- , even the heavy riffs fit well into the slow parts . Sombody said this is an anti-religion song ? I thought the guys were pretty religious -LRB- considering what they say on the other songs -RRB- . -LRB- 5/5 -RRB- 9 . ATWA - the fast chorus is done weirdly , but fits well into the rest of the song . -LRB- 4.5 / 5 -RRB- 10 . Science - wonderful Eastern middle part . perrrrfect . -LRB- 5/5 -RRB- 11 . Shimmy - strange , different lyrics , but okay . -LRB- 3.5 / 5 -RRB- 12 . Toxicity - AAAAAWWWWWW YEEEAAHHHH ! I heard this right when the album came out . At first i HATED it -LRB- can you imagine that ? -RRB- , but guess what ? now i LOVE it . -LRB- 463278496/5 -RRB- 13 . Psycho - fast , but a good chorus and a stable song . -LRB- 4.5 / 5 -RRB- 14 . Aerials - smooth . Heavy-sort guitar riffs , peaceful singing . -LRB- 5/5 -RRB- -LRB- 15 . What can I say ? I can only respect these guys for making something for their homeland . -RRB-
 Here 's what I think of each song :1 . Prison Song ~ This the only song I do n't like . It 's just too wierd .2 . Needles ~ It 's pretty good . There 's one part in the middle that I love -LRB- do n't know why -RRB- , before he says , `` I 'm sitting in my room , with a needle in my hand ... '' I just love the little tune .3 . Deer Dance ~ Good , sorta wierd ... 4 . Jet Pilot ~ Really funky . It 's great ! 5 . X ~ Interesting ... 6 . Chop Suey ! ~ Good . Nice guitar riffs .7 . Bounce ~ I love this song ! It 's catchy and jumpy and just really funny ! Pogo pogo pogo pogo pogo ! 8 . Forest ~ Good , gets better9 . Atwa ~ Pretty good .10 . Science ~ One of my favorites . I love the funky tunes in the middle of the song .11 . Shimmy ~ Wierd , yet strangely , very good .12 . Toxicity ~ Best song ever ! 13 . Psycho ~ Good , although the lyrics are a little strange .14 . Aerials ~ 2nd best song . The Indian-thing at the end is cool .
 There are millions of cd 's produced each year . But only one of them can be named cd of the year . This cd in fact is the greatest piece of art I have ever listened to . System of a down , is without a doubt my favorite band , and if you were to buy the cd you would see why . This is my review of each song .1 . Prison Song 8/10 Only an 8 because I am comparing it to the other songs on the cd that are better . But a great song non the less .2 Needles 9/10 One of the best songs on the album . Very hardcore but slows down when the guitarest starts to sing .3 . Deer Dance 8/10 A great song great chorus4 . Jet Pilot 6/10 You just cant start a song screaming even if you are System of a down5 . X 10/10 unbelievable ... this is when I knew the cd wouldnt stop being good6 . Chop Suey 10/10 good first single got me to buy the cd Chop suey is not even mentioned in the song lol7 . Bounce Very 8/10 If it carried on it would be bad but is less then 2 mintues long so its good .8 . Forest 10/10 My 3rd favorite on the cd ... It is another crazy hard then mellow song ... wow how does Serj Tankian do it ? 9 . Atwa 12/10 My favorite song on the cd ... slow mellow into `` YOU DONT CARE ABOUT HOW I FEEL ! `` 10 . Science . 9/10 Fast and quick and so damn good .11 . Shimmy 10/10 Looking to get pumped up , listen to it over and over12 . Toxicity 9/10 This song is a reason they could be the best band in the world13 . Psycho 8/10 Why did they describe their fans like this ? Oh wait ... because we are Psycho cocained and crazy !?! 14 . Aerials 10/10 2nd best song and 3rd single on the cd ... the middle eastern jive at the end is unreal.At first I did not like the band as much as I do now . Their first cd did not do that much for me ... but Chop Suey changed all ofd that . So do yourself a favor dont burn this cd ... give the band the credit they deserve and go buy it ... twice !
 This is doubtlessly better than the first SOAD album ! It 's got a great mix of songs and it has hardly a bad song on itHere 's a review of each track1 . Prison 8/10 this is a great opener ! quick and cool ! 2 . Needles 8/10 another good song which has pretty weird lyrics ... 3 . Deer Dance 7.5 / 10 this is a good song too . fast and a bit comical in the tune4 . Horse Pilot 5/10 This is my least favourite song on the album , they just shout a load of -LSB- stuff -RSB- 5 . X 6/10 another fast one with no real tune6 . Chopsuey ! 9/10 -LRB- at least -RRB- This is a cracking song with a great ending ! 7 . Bounce 6.5 / 10 woh this is weird8 . Forest 9/10 This is another great song which is weird yet brilliant9 . ATWA 9/10 perhaps the slowest song on the album . Yet moving and brilliant10 . Science 7.5 / 10 This is a good quick song11 . Shimmy 7.5 / 10 This is short but I like the tune12 . Toxicity 9/10 the big hit ! This is an awesome song ! 13 . Psycho 7/10 not bad , fast and difficult to sing along to .14 . Aerials 8/10 I probably should have given this more but the tune annoys me . This is a slow one and it 's good but it still annoys meSo there you go ! BUY THE ALBUM ! IT 'S AWESOME !!!!! -LRB- The Offspring rule do n't forget -RRB-
 Toxicity is the best album on the market . There is not one song on this cd that is n't awsome . My favorites include Forest , Chop Suey ! , and Bounce . And the cd itself is n't the only reason to buy this . it also comes with a DVD that includes Toxicity -LRB- Video -RRB- , Prison Song -LRB- Live -RRB- , Chop Suey ! -LRB- Live -RRB- , and Bounce -LRB- Live -RRB- . Do n't hesitate to buy this album and if anyone tells you otherwise then theyr ' e obviously out of their mind !
 I THINK THIS ALBUM IS COOL BUT THERE FIRST ONE WAS WAY METAL . IT KIND OF MAKES ME MAD THAT NO ONE CARES ABOUT THERE FIRST CD AND MANY PEOPLE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF IT AND ITS THERE BEST ONE .
 The driving beat , the sometimes amusing , sometimes political lyrics , the wailing guitar - everything . If you like a strong rock/metal influence with heart - give SOAD a try ! These guys ROCK !
 I had heard chopsuey in a pub and fell for it instantly . Incidentally i bought this album through you guys last month after going through some of ur reviews.I decided to buy it just for this number , but when i listened to the whole thing , i was kind of spellbound ... absolutely awesome stuff.I , ve been a crazy fan of linkin park for the past five years , but after listening to this one i would certainly add this band to my list of alltime favorites.so SOAD keep up the good work .
 As usual , SoaD brings it straightforward with hidden meanings only YOU can come up with . Innovating the new diverse genre considered `` System of a Down '' here comes the second album . Here 's the lineup :1 . Prison Song
 System of a Down 's follow up to their first album was much better than I thought it would be . Their first album was definitely better but this one was far from disappointing . All of their songs are fast paced and loud , but done well , unlike so many metal artists around today . This is a must buy for any fan of metal sounding music.Brad
 Im writing reviews in search of broadening my musical horizons so to speak . its time to ditch the blink and killswitch and move on to the wide world of music . I grew up in Washington so i do love the alternative music . I hope i dont up in the same category either.System of a Down was introduced to me in the form of `` Toxicity '' the song on the radio . It was a very interesting blend of metal at a time when i was very disillusioned with metal . the two common blends of metal seem to be either the direct descendents of a grunge era or that terrible type of music called screamo . The basis of both is that it is really heavy and theres no groove involved . This is the same for system of a down . They have a very post 2000 sound . The distortion is very clean cut and the drums are very clear and they follow the guitars . But the band does not limit themselves to that . they mix the rhythmic guitar work with the solos which ultimately leads to the singer . The drums a lot of times play their own time , most transparent in `` Toxicity '' . Serj is a very well spoken singer . having all the qualities of a great singer . when he sings out it is very heavenly , the band is very politically active so there is a bigger sense of umph behind the singing and lyrics , and his screams really do seem sincere . The political aspect of the songs are reminisent of Rage Against the Machine , very agressive and blatant . The most daunting of which is `` Deer Dance '' . `` Pushing little Children with their fully automatics , they like to push the weak around ! '' lyrics like these paints a very clear and angry picture . some bands scream for almost no real reason but serj 's lyrics are so outrageous that i would have it no other way . The most obviousely intricate and listenable tracks are `` Chop Suey '' and `` Toxicity '' . but after you get used to what the band is all about `` Forest '' , `` X '' , `` Science '' all fall into place . slowly the mind seeps into the intricacies of the guitar work . There is still some songs for me which i like but still are too obnoxious for me such as `` Bounce '' , and `` Jet Pilot '' . sometimes they get a bit too crazy .
 This is a very unique album . The Stand Out song for me is chop-suey . S.O.A.D is a very unique band . . and i like them . . keep it going .

 this Cd is great and has some truthful messages . i like `` Deer Dance '' its about brutal police and is a great metal song.another one is `` Prison Song '' its about how america has too many priaons and is true , treatment should be increased , and law enforcement decreased . this is a great CD from a great band , buy it today !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 What a disc . Out of the five biggest releases of the metal scene - this , Tool 's Lateralus , Slipknot 's Iowa , Machine Head 's Supercharger , and Incubus 's Morning View -LRB- sorry Slayer and Megadeth fans , I 'm talking commercial wise -RRB- , this has to be the best - and I have n't heard Incubus yet , so you can tell I mean business . The massive range of influences on show mix together in a blend so potent that a fan of only one of the styles on show will almost certaintly love every track . `` Prison Song '' - self-explanatory . As Wicked Neil said , this is what Rage Against The Machine did , but did n't . `` Chop Suey '' , the first single , is stunning , an amalgam of twisting styles , with a very sweet melody from Serj . He 's got the `` best . . metal voice ... EVER `` And before you come to a jarring HALT , one last piece `` Aerials '' , shows the band 's Eastern influences . Closing in at an all-too-brief 44 minutes , it 's even better buying the Special Edition CD-ROM version -LRB- red cover , making-of CD ROM , 3 extra tracks - that makes 18 -RRB- . Good Good Good ! Not only is this the best metal album so far this year , it 's an awesome introduction to a wider range of styles . As Pitchshifter said - `` GEEEENNNNIIIUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUSSSS ! ''
 I was lucky enough to go to Ozzfest for free by wining tickets , and they were the best band there , period . Their second CD is deffinintaly one of my best , and shows they can go from speed metal 1-2 trashes to calm melodic beats , and back . Any fan of Heavy Metal/Rock should and would like this album . BUY IT , IT ROCKS !!
 This L.A. metal band really has a unique sound . Their material is very original and unforgettable , and their performance is so good , that you will soon forget how unique their in-your-face sound is . My favorite tracks on the CD are ` Needles ' , ` Deer Dance ' , ` Chop Suey ! ' , ` Forest ' and ` Aerials ' . Each song has a different style to it , and each is as enjoyable as the last . This is one of the few American metal bands I really enjoy listening to . You can not compare their music to anyone elses . I take pride in the fact that there are a few American bands that do n't go along with everyone elses ' sound .
 I 'm a local from L.A. and have seen System Of A Down in little clubs in Hollywood before the huge outbreak of their music . I love them and will always.If there is a void in your life and need some filling , this will do it . I promise . It 's hard and original , it 's not something the record label is trying to push to make tons of money ... this album does n't need that.It 's a well balanced CD with everything you need for every mood . They always had the power to do that , and I do n't think that will ever change . If you are wondering if you should pick this up or not , my adivce would be ... . Pick it up !
 I actually heard System Of A Down on the Loud Rocks compilation Cd covering Wu - Tang Clan 's `` Wu-Tang Clan ` Ai n't Nuthin Ta ... With '' and loved it ! I purchased Toxicity and was floored ! It 's so melodic and playful but hard at the same time . The gems are Aerials , Toxicity , Prison Song , and Chop Suey ; but the rest is solid as well . Go get it !
 I share my experience because I feel it may be similar to other folks who have n't gotten on the System bandwagon yet . Before I owned Toxicity , I saw System in concert and absolutely HATED them . I had heard , of course , Sugar and Spiders from their self-titled album , but knew very little about them . The blazing fast , sticcato -LRB- sp ? -RRB- rhythyms did n't jibe well with what I was used to hearing . It does n't belong in the burgeoning rap-core genre , nor does it belong in the classic dark-metal arena , there 's too much energy here . After repeatedly hearing my friends praise Toxicity right and left , I decided to pick up the album . After a few listens , finally I get it.Toxicity will absolutely blow your mind . It 's an adrenaline charged non-stop ride . It is a drug that you ca n't get enough of . The songs ruminate in your head and the only way to get them out is to listen at high volume . Unfortunately , listening to the album only puts the songs back in your head ! The album could just as well be one continuous song , it flows so well and rarely stops for air . Serj 's beautiful voice on top of the brutal guitars and make a truly awesome combo . Even guitarist Daron 's frequent backup vocals are amazing . Listening to the album -LRB- and having the lyrics -RRB- really helps to understand there is a deeper meaning behind each and every one of the songs . Goodness ! Raw energy AND meaningful lyrics ? System is indeed a rare commodity nowadays.So now , I recently saw System of a Down again at Ozzfest . I was totally charged to see the place blow up . However , I looked around the crowd and saw so many that were like me , who just did n't get it . I 'd say about 30 % of the audience was - really - into the music . These are the people who own Toxicity . I was convinced that , like most bands , the live performance would be slower and more laid-back . Not true ! System 's live performance is every bit as energetic as the album , if not more so . Please do yourself a favor and get this album!Thank you System of a Down , finally I get it .
 Its a great cd i will not say anymore , because you all heard it before getit !
 System of a Down 's , Toxicity , was the cd that got me into heavy music -LRB- nu-metal/metal -RRB- . Toxicity is my favorite cd for one reason ... it 's perfect . It 's heavy when it needs to be , and melodic at the right times . Every song holds it 's own unique message and sound . I love every song on this musical masterpiece.Rating -LRB- 1-10 -RRB- Prison Song - -LRB- 8/10 -RRB- i 'll finish this later
 Toxicity is simply one of the best albums to come out in years , and System of a Down is the Elite of force in rock . You wo n't find any sappy love songs , or garbage lyrics on Toxicity . Lead singer Serj 's vocals are hard-hitting , melodic , meaningful , and straight to the point . The bands songs do n't dwell on social relationships , but instead their views on real-world issues . Their mix of hard rock riffs , powerful drumming , screaming vocals mixed with melodic lyrics , and heavy bassline work perfectly together . As do their Armenian influence mixed with Southern California attitude , provide rock fans a band with a completely distinct sound . Comparing System of a Down to bands like Slipknot , or Limp Bizkit though , is a complete insult . Slipknot is on a completely different playing field and has nowhere near the talent to hang with SOAD . Same goes for Limp Bizkit and with their garbage lyrics . System of a Down is far above and beyond their rock competitors both musically and lyrically . The only other bands that are in the same league as SOAD are Tool , The Strokes , Radiohead -LRB- Kid A ; in particular -RRB- , Incubus -LRB- before they sold out on Morning View -RRB- , Linkin Park -LRB- even though their mainstream now -RRB- , and The Red Hot Chili Peppers . System of a Down is the future of music , and I hope they continue to grow , evolve , and educate . From beginnning to end , SOAD delivers on Toxicity . My favorites are
 System of a down is some of the best hard rock music out there besides TOOL becuase everything is so harmonic that it is like symphony rock . I think that SOAD is a great band becuase they all understand the basic theory of music and how to create music with others in harmony . The singing is awsome . I have seen few people that can use such a range of notes . He goes from screaming to growling , to high pitch without hesitation . The guitarist and the bassist in SOAD work very well together to create a symphony of rock . The drummer works in perfect . TOOL is the only band that you can really compare SOAD to today . All of the other rock has a lot of bs involved . People who are n't talented musicians are not worth listening to .
 I got this album the week it came out , and I half expected it to be a weak production . No way ! This cd rules , and the only lame track on it is ATWA . Everything else rules ! Catch these guys live , if you really want a cool show . They have an amazing stage presence , and you can tell you 're looking at something cool . When I saw them , Shavo tripped and fell , but he kept playing ! Exelent band , exelent cd !
 This is the most creative and best work of music in 2001 . THis is probably more inventive than their first one . Recommended to anybody that like SOAD or a brand new metal fan .
 This album is soooo good . It is incredibly AWESOME ! Just listen to it acouple of times and you will be addicted .
 System of a Down is by far the best band on this planet . They have just released their mind blowing record , Toxicity . It features all the greatest songs on there like Toxicity , Forest , ATWA , Deer Dance , X , Chop Suey ! , Shimmy , Science , Prison Song and many , many more ! When I first got this album , I listened to it for the whole week without listening to any of my other CD 's . This proves how good Toxicity is . Forest , Deer Dance , X and Toxicity are my favorite songs on there because they all have great drumming -LRB- every song has great drumming but these for songs are the best -RRB- so if you have found some money in your wallet , go out there and buy the powerful TOXICITY and experience the SYSTEM !!!
 This is one bad -LSB- rear -RSB- group ! I have both of their albums and the only problem is that I listen to them so much that I ca n't get the songs out of my head.Killer lyrics and wonderful beats . You wo n't be disappointed .
 System of a Down is one of the most original bands in the major label music business today . This release is full of great lyrics , great vocals , and nut-kicking grooves . The track `` Toxicity '' has one of the all-time great endings and speaks to the `` inner warrior '' in us all . A must have have for all ! ...
 Let me start by saying that i was extremely nervous about buying this cd . I loved Chop Suey and had a hunger for more SOAD and bugged my friends for more of their music and was rewarded with aerials , and sugar -LRB- yes this is from their other cd . -RRB- After listening to those 3 songs for a week I decided to buy one of their cds ... but i couldnt pick which one ... so i bought both . Now heres the reveiw . This was my first Cd of this type . Soad doesnt seem to really fit in to any of the catagories for music ... soad is just soad . This Cd has a lot more heavy music than just Chop Suey.Interestingly enough Chop suey lies right in the middle of the cd , separating the heavier music such as prison song and X from the softer songs such as Aerials and Atwa . Chop suey is a good mix and basic representation of Soads music.Basically the best way to decide if you want this cd is to listen to the 30 second preveiws offered by amazon . Most of the samples have a section of the song and its transitions from harder music to softer . Go out , buy , listen , enjoy .
 The music speaks for itself . It is awesome . Each song is uniquely different and enticing , and anyone who says that it all sounds the same just does n't get music at all ...
 I bought this album after seeing the `` Toxcicity '' video on MTV2 . I had known a few of System of a Down 's songs , but after I heard this song , I really liked it . I must admit , I 'm a little dissapointed in the album overall , but nonetheless , I enjoy listening to it . I love the songs Chop Suey , Atwa , and Toxicity . Those songs made the album well worth buying . The other songs , however , all sound alike , but are okay to listen to . Despite this , I do not regret buying this album . Be your own judge .
 There are a few CD 's out there that are able to be played when you want loud , loud , I mean frikkin loud music . You know the kind to take out some agression , or just to get pumped . Rage Against the Machine was the original LOUD CD , but I think Toxicity might be its equivalent . This CD is excellent .
 I loved this cd from the moment I heard it . My friend Ani let me borrow it and when I listened 2 it I though ... holy ... crap ... yeah ... it wuz such a good cd ! All of system of a downs ' cds are good but this one was the best . Even my dad likes it and he 's into all of that old sh ** . Anyway it was a terrific album and I ca n't get enough of it . By the way here are some great songs from the Cd :1 . CHOP SUEY ! 2 . PRISON SONG3.FOREST4.ATWA5.DEER DANCE6.SCIENCETHOSE ARE THE REALLY GOOD SONGS ON THAT CD !! : -RRB-
 This album is by far their best , not Hypnotize , not Mezmerize and not their self-titled . It 's strong political message and historical innuendos concerning Armenian genocide is paralleled by some heavy rockin MADNESS ! This album has including a variety of styles including punk , middle eastern instrumentals , jazz , and hardcore riffs . It is unmatched by any metal album i 've ever heard !!! I 've had it since it came out and i 'm still not tired of it .1 . Prison Song
 Back in 2001 , when I first bought ` Toxicity ' , I listened to it alot . It was an addictive hard rock album that lasted for a few months . After that period of time though , while its still a good , enjoyable album , it gets kind of old , and the songs are just too overplayed everywhere . This album also marked a good time in my life as well , so it means alot to me . If you are in for a good mainstream hard rock , head banging , mosh pitting time , then get this . If you want a classic that you can listen to twenty years from now , maybe you should look else where , but this is just too good of a cd to actually miss , so I would suggest that you check it out . Now , I 'll tell you more about the album . ` Toxicity ' starts with the loud and heavy ` Prison Song ' , and throughout the album its like being in a tornado of rock . Limited edition versions of this album are also available -LRB- The covers are red and blue -RRB- if you can find them . They were fairly easy to obtain three years ago , but they can prove to be hard to get today .
 This CD is littered with hints and certain political messages , which is okay in my book . As long as the music is good , you can sing about whatever you want!The music is great , the tunes are catchy and you can really sing to the songs !! How can anyone not like `` Chop Suey '' anyway ? Or `` Aerials '' ? This album is packed with great songs.A personl favorite ? `` Pogo '' . A fun , quirky song , that is still catchy and fun!This album has been out for awhile ... I am just getting to review everything , I know ... but hey , why not ? This album does n't have as many reviews as Ashley Simpson 's album ... * chuckles *
 ... as printed on the CD - including in vocal terms , let me add . 3 Outstanding ! tracks - `` Needles '' , `` Chop Suey ! '' and `` Toxicity '' , another couple just a few steps away - `` Atwa '' and `` Aerials '' , and plus 9 tracks of a unique sounding , that 's for sure . Indispensable !
 This is my favorite CD of all time probably . The songs have so much political and social meaning to me . System of a Down probably has just a hint of an intended meaning in their songs , but they do n't care how you take their lyrics . That 's the whole point . Their songs only mean what they mean to you . So much people say they 're a religeous band and a political band , it 's not true . They sing and dance about what they see around them in this world . This CD is so great though . Shimmy is probably my favorite song now . I think it 's about the insane subjugating school system . Some awsome tunes and lyrics here .
 prison song 9/10-great song , sound andry when serj said `` they try to built the prisonneedles 8/10-a little bit screaming , this is the only song that I heard daron singingdear dance 10/10 - good song , just like prison song and good bridgejet pilot 6/10-a little bit short but okx 8/10 - cool intro , screamingchop suey ! 10/10-best intro I ever heard , weird lyrics but cool songbounce 7/10-its about pogo stick and its very cool songforest 8/10-serj singing like he was dying but pretty good ending of this songATWA 7/10-not much to say , weird titlescience 9/10-arabian , fast song but pretty goodshimmy 9/10-cool but one problem too short , you can found this song in tony hawk pro skater 4 gametoxicity 10/10-their 2nd single , cool intropsyho 9/10-great guitar tuning at the ending of this songaerials 10/10-their 3rd single , good song , my favourite song alsobonus track-funny , american junglebuy now at store near you today
 I love this shhhtuff !!!! They are Queen of this generation ... anthem songs ... creative and sound humrous at times ... mixed with good ole hard core ... need 2 buy this folks ...
 System of a down are like dr pepper , you have to try them to like them . Most of my friends say they are crap but i totally disagree . System are one of my favorite bands as they do n't stick to the rules and they dont follow political correctness.The music has soul behind it , you can tell this by their desire to entertain and their lyrics , most of the time the lyrics help you relate to the songs and get you thinking.Prison Song - 10/10 Fast paced song , catchy lyricsNeedles - 10/10 Catchy lyrics and wiered chorusDeer Dance - 10/10 very fast pace and political charged?Jet Piolet - 7/10 Lyrically substandardX - 8/10 Talks about Genecide -LRB- TOO SHORT , BUT GOOD -RRB- Chop Suey - 10/10 -LRB- You 've all heard it you know what to expect ! -RRB- Bounce - 8/10 Not as good as people say and again too short.Forest - 10/10 Lyrics like umpa lumpas but generally good.ATWA - 9/10 Not one of my favourites but nice interlude.Science - 10/10 Fast paced song and good guitar riffs.Shimmy - 8/10 Good but probably written under the influence.Toxicity - 10/10 Best song on the album and not much else to say.Psycho - 10/10 Very fun and Fast.Aerials - 10/10 last song , nice way to finish off the album , very good bass line at the beggining.TOTAL
 Toxicity is an amazing album . I 've never heard anything like this before . It 's so unique.The first System song I heard was Chop Suey , and at first I did n't like it . I thought it just did n't work . I did n't get what the whole thing about System was . And anyone in the same situation as me , just listen to it.But as I heard it more , it grew on me . Their sound is so unique , you 'll either love it , or you 'll hate it . And personally , I love it.My favourite songs of the album are Chop Suey and Bounce . Chop Suey is an amazing song . It almost seems like it 's in 2 parts - a slow emotional part , and a faster , harder rock part . And yet these 2 fit together to make something amazing.Bounce just makes me laugh . If anyone has been to badgerbadgerbadger.com , it reminds me of that . It 's a really upbeat , funny song . And the only way it could be improved is by making it longer . Come on , you 're only giving us 2 minutes of this !! Anyone who is slightly hesitant about System - and I do n't blame you if you are , I was , should definitely listen to this . It 's an incredible CD and when you 've heard it once , you 'll want to hear it more and more and more .
 What genre is System of a Down ? Originally I thought SOAD was Heavy Metal , but now I 'm hearing Hard Rock?Eh , well genre aside , I am so glad to have bought this cd . I 'm a person who 5 days ago nearly hated Metal , screaming music . SOAD changed this for me . SOAD mixes catchy melodies with rythmical screaming . I am a permanent fan.This is most definately a cd worth buying , even if Metal music is n't your favorite . Especially now when it 's an older cd and the price has dropped.If you have Windows Media Player , a few of the songs are available in the `` Media Guide '' -LRB- www.windowsmedia.com -RRB- . If those songs do n't sway you , then I do n't know what to say .
 after five awesome years of owning toxicity i still consider this to be one of my favorite cds . i also find that other people who usually cant stand metal/hard rock have enjoyed alot of the songs on this cd , especially songs like `` bounce '' and `` prison song '' which are very fun and catchy . If you listen to the radio you have probably already heard some of the best songs on this album like
 System of a Down 's `` Toxicity '' has got to be one of the best hard rock albums I 've heard in a while . Sophisticated stuff for mature listeners only . If I could give this higher than five stars , I would . Totally awesome !
 Toxicity is one of the best albums ever . Every metal fan should buy it NOW . In my opinion , there is only one filler song on this 14-track cd , Jet Pilot , although by other standards , it is quite good.Here is a short review of each song in turn .1 . Prison Song . 7/10 . Good song but a bit repetitive . A good start to the album .2 . Needles . 8/10 . Here you get an idea about what System are really about .3 . Deer Dance . 8/10 . A good song .4 . Jet Pilot . 6/10 . The album 's only filler song . Fast and furious .5 . X. 7/10 . A good outburst of power .6 . Chop Suey ! .10 / 10 . Arguably the best song ever written and the album 's track .7 . Bounce . 7/10 . A mad rant of stupidity . Weheay ! 8 . Forest . 9/10 . A very good song .9 . Atwa . 8/10 . A soft ballad turned into a demonic shout . Well Done .10 . Science . 9/10 . Another political rant .11 . Shimmy . 8/10 . An experimental song that works well .12 . Toxicity . 10/10 . Genius .13 . Psycho . 7/10 . Psycho by name , psycho by nature .14 . Aerials . 9.5 / 10 . Brilliant ending to this great album .
 One day early last summer I was driving home from work and I heard this incredible song . It was fast and furious one minute , then slow and ballad-like the next but was entirely compelling the whole time . I rarely love songs the first time hearing them , but Chop Suey ! was one of the few exceptions to this rule.Toxicity has a lot more to offer than its first single , Chop Suey ! and its radio-favored title track , although both are great songs . The album ranges from the overtly political -LRB- despite what the band says -RRB- in `` Prison Song '' to the purely entertaining `` Bounce . '' Some tracks , such as `` Aerials '' and `` Forest '' are strangely melodic . Others , like `` Prison Song '' and `` X '' are heavier on the shouting than the singing , but still without being obnoxious . Most are a combination of the two ends of the spectrum , as seen in `` Chop Suey ! '' `` Psycho , '' and `` Deer Dance . `` My personal favorites are `` Aerials '' for not just the radio-friendly melody but for the obvious intensity with which lead singer Serj Tankian sings the lyrics . `` Psycho '' is another favorite of mine , if for no other reason than the interesting subject matter-coke addicted groupies . Finally , the short and sweet fast-paced `` Shimmy '' makes the list for pure entertainment value , while still managing to be at least borderline political.Hard rock is finally out and available to the masses , and no rock lover 's CD collection would be complete without this album .
 The first System Of a Down song I ever heard was Chop Suey , and like most people , it shocked me . It was weird yet melodic . But the mainstream aspect of it turned me away , because if it 's on MTV then I do n't appeal to it . But after being introduced to some more of SOAD from internet and took a gamble and picked up the CD . And the first track `` Prison Song '' got me hooked . The sudden rhythm changes and brilliant timing and song writing was exactly what I had been looking for . Then CD definetely appeals to me . For those who like easier listening and catchy hooks from mainstream MTV music , then you might not like this . But take a gamble and buy it or download some songs and you could easily be surprised . Standout tracks include Prison Song , Aerials with its beauty and great songwriting , Bounce with its overall weirdness and hilarity -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- , Science with supberb timing and good vareity of rhythm and intensity , Toxicity -LRB- Self Titled Track -RRB- with some of the best drumming heard on mainstream these days , the drumming came at me like Basket Case when I first heard it , X , and Shimmy with its catchy and humorous chorus . You wo n't be dissapointed I think , and maybe it is n't as long lasting as Nirvana , but it kicks major @ $ $ to me at this moment . Take a gamble .
 A dynamic and intense follow-up album to their self-titled debut , System of A Down 's Toxicity contains many vast political and social views depicted within a metal environment . The CD 's uniqueness surpasses any of which I have seen from a metal in the current time . It is a mixture of various styles of music as viewed in aerials there is a light acoustic guitar with mellow vocals but in songs like prison song and X you get more of a metal vibe . The vocals on this CD were in my opinion what sets it apart from the rest of the current CDs out in this genre , they are very vibrant and go from a slow melodic beat to a rapid out roar of screaming and heavy guitar riffs in a matter of seconds without loosing its composure . Its very unusual for a band to show such diversity but System of a Down does it with such a style that it has compelled me to listen to it over and over for a countless amount of days now .
 Bought this album cos System were going to tour with Slipknot in Australia . Listened to it , thought to my self System should be headlining the Aussie tour . If their live shows are anything like their album the will blow us all away . Just hope the younger generation of todays society dont get themselves caught listening to Blink and Limp Bizket . Get some System into your blood , it will boil .
 System of a Down 's debut is a metal masterpiece , and was definitely the best metal album released in 1998 in my opinion . So there was no way Toxicity could top it , and does n't . But what an interesting metal stew it is
 Well ... after hearing the first effort from SOAD I was really pumped up for their follow up . After their utterly brilliant debut , the LA quartet had a serious task on their hands to follow it up . After rushing out to buy it on the first day it was available , I have to say that it has lived up to all my expectations ... and then some.Toxicity is a natural progression for the band , if natural is the right word to describe such a unique and quirky sound that is System of a Down . The rapid time changes are there once again , heard most evidently on tracks like Chop Suey ! and Science . The utterly brilliant Bounce is a testament to how creative these guys really are.The political messages are much more obvious this time around , and despite the occasionally cryptic lyrics -LRB- Jet Pilot -RRB- , they are clearly hammered out in tracks like Prison Song and Psycho . The middle Eastern influence has been toned down slightly from the first album , but the songs here fit better together as a unit then they do on the bands first effort , and are more accesible -LRB- ` Soil ' anyone ? -RRB- , while still retaining their creativity and craziness.Musically , this album is utterly fantastic . No two songs are the same , and while some may argue that tracks like ATWA are slightly similar to the ones on the first album , what is wrong with that ? They still have no parallel on commercial radio . These guys have more creativity in their little finger than Limp Bizkit , Linkin Park and Creed combined.This album is right up there with Fantomas ' superb ` The Directors Cut ' and rates as one of the best metal releases this year.If you liked the self-titled , you will love this album . If you have n't heard it , do yourself a favour and get a copy of it now !
 The main reason I decided to buy this CD was because of `` Chop Suey ! '' , which I had heard a lot on the radio . I quickly found out that unlike most rock bands that I listen to , SOAD is VERY political , but I guess thats what makes them unique . Anyway , the CD is pretty good , but since I 'm not a death metal fan , I do n't live by their music . Here 's a breakdown of the CD .1 . Prison Song -LRB- 7/10 -RRB- One of their more interesting songs . I would n't say that the guitar riffs are extremely pleasant , but the catchy lyrics kept me from discarding this song as crap .2 . Needles -LRB- 8/10 -RRB- A little too much screaming , but once again , clever lyrics . Nice guitar part on `` Pull the tapeworm out of your -LSB- ass -RSB- . Also , cool bridge and tempo change .3 . Deer Dance -LRB- 7/10 -RRB- Yeah , about that chorus ... pretty worthless , but once again , creative bridge .4 . Jet Pilot -LRB- 5/10 -RRB- I like the verses and the rest stinks .5 . X -LRB- 7/10 -RRB- WE DO N'T NEED TO MULTIPLY ... This is a pretty cool short song ... very short verses , though .6 . Chop Suey ! -LRB- 10/10 -RRB- Awesome song , great chorus , good middle part except for the cursing .7 . Bounce -LRB- 3/10 -RRB- Retarded song , too short .8 . Forest -LRB- 8/10 -RRB- Good song except for the verses . Serj sounds like he is dying . Nice chorus , though . Strong ending eith a cool beat change .9 . ATWA -LRB- 9/10 -RRB- Not much to say . Weird title , but cool electric guitar part in the middle .10 . Science -LRB- 9/10 -RRB- Fast-paced song with pretty cool guitar riffs and a surprising bridge .11 . Shimmy -LRB- 7/10 -RRB- Pretty cool beat , but pretty basic song , but once again , too short .12 . Toxicity -LRB- 10/10 -RRB- Another stand-out song , cool beginning and verses . The chorus is a little wild , but an unpredictable finish makes up for that .13 . Psycho -LRB- 8/10 -RRB- I would probably only give this a 7 but there is a cool electric guiar solo at the very end of the song .14 . Aerials -LRB- 10/10 -RRB- Another radio hit with a good beginning acoustic guitar part . The only thing wrong with this song is its 6 minute length.Overall , this CD is 108/140 , which is about a 4 . If you are fed up with normal heavy metal and are looking for a variety of songs , this is the CD for you , but do n't judge the CD by its first part . The last 7 tracks are the best . TOXICITY is a very cool collection of music talking about issues in everday life .
 This album is so full of time changes i didnt know what way my head was going to roll to . . a brillant awesome modern rock album that makes you never wan na stop listening to metal me im in my 18 year started im my nappy and enough of that filth . . i hope there next album is better than that mixed bag of rubbish steal this album a total cash in with 3 good songs sorry not good enough when u go from this sort of album the next is always going to be a disappointment so i dare system to better this album if they do i will give them a written apology but i doubt it thank you for caring to read this Respect
 It highly irritates me when people bash records or bands just because they have finally gotten some airplay or have become popular . Many of these reader reviews that say Toxicity is such a horrible album say so because songs like `` Chop Suey ! '' or `` Aerials '' have gotten so much airplay . ... This is fantastically written and produced -LRB- another no-no to these hardcore fanatics -RRB- . They are still very political , even in the song `` Bounce '' . The meaning of `` Bounce '' is just a bit hidden . I 'm not going to tell you directly of the meaning , but i 'll give you some hints . `` She has so many friends/went through many hands '' . SO ... to these people who bash Toxicity purely for the reason that it has become extremely successful , I say to thee ... ...
 ... how does it compare with their first ? there are three differences . the first difference is that the first one is a lot darker and controversial , and with those characteristics comes bad language , which toxicity has none . -LRB- that was what made me think they had sold out , removing the language to make it more `` radio friendly '' -RRB- the second difference is that daron -LRB- the guitarist -RRB- backs up on the vocals a lot , whereas he only did this once on the first album . the third difference is that tankian 's vocals change as well . on the first album , he had five different voice ranges
 System Of A Down 's album `` Toxicity '' is one of the greatest rock albums i have ever heard . With producer Rick Rubin where can you go wrong ? The album is one of the best recordings of 2001 and should have won the Grammy for best rock performance or album or something , System of a Down needs a whole lot more attention than they 've been getting . True , `` Toxicity '' did enter Billboard 's album charts at # 1 and went on to sell over 3,000,000 copies nation wide , but there are still thousands that have n't experienced the best rock group of the new millenium . This album leaks with killer songs
 One of my most listened to CD 's in my collection , Toxicity is one of my all time favorite albums , and System Of A Down is one of my all time favorite bands.Chop Suey - While I 'm not sure bout the songs meaning I do know that it is my favorite song on the album , from the moment it was released . Serj 's voice is mindblowing and so powerful and beautiful and chaotic all at the same time.Toxicity - This has to be one of the coolest songs from the metal gods , it begins quitely and melodically enough then like a crack of thunder , it SLAMS into this insane onslaught of drum abuse , and brutal guitar riffs . The Bass guitar seems to literally explode , Serj 's voice is gentle and powerful and angry , screaming bout the ` disorder ' of the city . The toxicity of our city!Aerials - A beautiful yet haunting intro leads this song into a climax that ends in the opening chorus `` we all drink from the waterfall then turn around and put up our walls . `` Now what album would be complete without a rocking tribute to the movie Psycho - This song begins interestingly enough with a bass line , then slowly -LRB- just like the shower scene , in fact it even has the sound effect . -RRB- it builds and builds and builds til it ends on the line , `` psycho groupie cocaine crazy , pyshco groupie coke '' Awesome song - Rating 4.5 / 5 stars.ATWA - This song took me by surprise in the literal sense LOL , i totally am in love with it , beautiful , just beautiful !
 To begin with , I LOVE this cd ; however , when I purchased ` Toxicity ' I was expecting all of the tunes to have the harmonies present in Chop Suey ! and -LRB- the song -RRB- Toxicicity . That was not the case . Not all of these tracks are quite as catchy -LRB- at first -RRB- as the songs getting radio play.With that said , this is an incredible cd ! It 'll definitely be on your list of cd 's that make you drive about 80 miles/hour on the highway without even noticing . This cd has some heavy material on it , great for unwinding after a long day . There 's some serious intensity on this disc that I ca n't describe in words . I picked up the disc after hearing Chop Suey ! and Toxicicty and it 's been in heavy rotation in the car ever since.PLUS - You get the bonus DVD with the Toxicity Video and 3 live tracks -LRB- Prison , Chop Suey ! , & Bounce -RRB- . If you 're looking for somthing heavy , pick this up . But just know that it 's not all `` Chop Suey ! '' and `` Aerials '' .
 Every once and a while there comes an album that is so incendiary and different that even the fickle mainstream can not ignore it . Toxicity is one of those albums ... . I was not exactly impressed by SOAD 's self titled effort , but when I first laid my ears on Toxicity I knew it was something special . If so called `` nu metal '' had a masterpiece , an album that would define the genre for years to come , this is it . Toxicity is the Number of the Beast of modern commercial metal.System of a Down very much prescribe to the school of `` less is more '' . Daron Malakian 's guitar riffs have a caveman quality to them , yet they add color to the song that senseless wanking never would . Unlike most of their contemporaries , they have a sound all their own and an original approach to song writing which includes -LRB- sometimes choppy -RRB- key changes and eastern influences.This CD transcends genres , offering something for death metal , hardcore , punk , popular rock , and new wave fans alike ... while remaining unique . You could file it under the progressive tag and be self assured , because it definitely marks a progression in popular music.The groups Armenian background lends a hand in forging their sound , -LRB- see bridge to Deer Dance , Aerials -RRB- which often results in beautiful eastern melodies that sound perfectly at home in their frenetic blend of heavy music . To top everything off , Serj Tankian 's vocals are refreshingly devoid of the Jonathan Davis or Maynard Keenan copycat complex most newer bands suffer from , furthering his status as a great frontman.My favorite songs are Needles -LRB- which contains a groove even the most battle hardened hardcore kid would love -RRB- , the absolutely brilliant Deer Dance , Jet Pilot , X -LRB- metal fans who doubt their heaviness , check this -RRB- , Science -LRB- more greatness -RRB- , Toxicity and ATWA . At first , their schitzophrenic stylings turned me off , but this CD grew on me like no other , untill it held a monopoly on my playlist for at least a solid week . Anybody who dismisses it in a similar way upon first listen , spend a little more time with it , you may end up falling in love.Of course , there are a few throwout tracks , namely Psycho and Shimmy , and I find Aerials to be dull , but that 's what skip buttons are made for . This CD is absolutely killer and it 's staying power is proof that a good band CAN survive in today 's world of redudant rapcore garbage
 This CD is the sh-t . I love this album . Everything on this one is great . Best songs thoughPrison Song , Needles , Deer Dance , Chop Suey ! , Forest , ATWA -LRB- best song -RRB- , Shimmy , Toxicity , and Aerials.a damn good album . better than their first record , by far.check this one out . one of the best from 2001 , if not the best .
 It 's almost surprising to hear a band of Systems ' intensityplayed with such regularity on the radio , but they 're popularitydoes n't detract from their quirky , powerful metal stylings . This disk kicks MAJOR * SS all the way through !! From the intro cut , `` Prison Song '' to the last track , `` Arials '' , it is an aural treat . Serj 's vocals combine with music that is undenialbly crushing to produce a sound that is unique , and oddly enough , despite the dark undercurrent of this CD , celebratory . Listen for yourself if you think I 'm off my rocker !!! System Of A Down 's music on this sophomore effort does n't over-shadow their previous self-titled disk , it merely expands upon what they began with it . And Serj 's lyrics relay a man in tune with his reality ... he gives voice to angst and sarcasm , along with biting social commentary -LRB- ` Science ' , ` Toxicity ' and ` Psycho ' ; reveals an upbeat side with tracks like ` Shimmy ' ; and finally balances things out by revealling a thoughtful flirtation with spirituality in tracks like ` Jet Pilot ' , ` Chop Suey ! ' , and ` Aerials ' . All in all , `` Toxicity '' is a very satisfying release . It 's quirky , dark , fun and intelligent . Definitely a must for your collection !!
 System of a Down is one of the most creative and original bands currently on the music scene . They combine nearly death metal like songs , to slow-moving ballads . Serj Tankian , who is probably the best rock singer I 've ever heard , with his beautiful voice ringing out , sends chills down my back . Another great thing about his voice is that it is obvious that the band does n't use pitch correction . Do you ever hear that computer like sound in many singers these days -LRB- a la Scott Stapp of Creed -RRB- ? Serj Tankian 's voice is not computerized and that is his real voice . Daron Malakian 's voice is completely opposite of Serj 's , not as intense and more high-pitched , but on the numerous times the band uses harmony , they 're voices interlock . Add great bass playing , and probably the best drummer out there . Here 's a breakdown of the songs : Prison Song - This song is pretty bizarre , with Serj doing what I think is his version of rapping near the end . Good message about the way the American prison system is screwed up.Needles - Verrrry bizarre . With a chorus of
 This has to be one of the best albums I 've ever heard . Now , I 'll have to come out honest , when I first heard System of a Down , I did n't like their song , `` Chop Suey ! '' , because I 'm not usually into that kind of faced-paced , fast talking type of music ... It usually gives me a headache . Though I do like rock , not normally that fast . But once `` Toxicity '' -LRB- the song , -RRB- came out , I really liked it ... it grew on me , but I ended up liking it . I heard it enough on the radio until one day I decided , `` O.K. , just buy the CD , '' so I went ahead and did it ... knowing that when I do this , most CDs I have n't heard yet sound really bad . . heh ... only one or two songs are usually good . But , this one is good all the way through . It 's awesome . They mix heavy riffs with sort of a middle-eastern sound ... and it 's really unique . They 're just a really awesome , unique band . My favorite songs would have to be `` ATWA , '' `` Aerials , '' `` Science , '' and of course , `` Toxicity . '' ` Science ' though , is awesome . Oh , enough of my blabbing ... just by the album ! : D
 Wow is a great word to describe this album . Ive been waiting three months to get it and its finally here . This is definately good for anyone how likes hardcore , death-metal , or punk . SOAD has elements of all three . This is definately worth the buy .
 SOAD have to be one of the most original bands on the scene at the moment , and as such , are deserving of huge recognition -LRB- although I 'm not too sure if they 'll get it , at least on my side of the water -RRB- . This album is both intelligent and entertaining , and shows what great musicians the 4 band members are . Stand out tracks for me are Toxicity and Aerials -LRB- the more mellow tracks -RRB- , but Bounce is a classic . I knew after hearing their first album that I was onto something great , and this album proves it !! One of the big disappointments is that they did n't get Mike Patton to appear on the album , which had been rumoured - oh well , I guess we ca n't have everything .
 i just have to say that this album is just great , it follows well in the footsteps of the other.these guys know how to rock , pure and simple.do your self a favor and pick up this loud mess of great rock .
 I do n't usually give 5 stars for an album but I think I will go against that for this . This is one of those albums that you may need to listen through a few times to truly respect it . What I find to be most amazing about this album is the band 's choice of having more musical diversity . It is a pleasure to hear that a band of this nature can still remain musical and not go for a hard core sound only . I definately recommend this album .
 ... and I like the band . But I do n't think this album will win them many new fans . It 's really short -LRB- 44min -RRB- and , while the sound quality is still really good , most of the songs sound a bit unpolished . Some songs -LRB- like `` Bounce '' -RRB- sound like experimentation -LRB- `` pogopogopogopogo '' as percussion ? -RRB- , and a couple -LRB- `` Jet Pilot '' I think it 's called and `` X '' -RRB- are pretty valueless , even obnoxious , as far as I can tell . `` Chop Suey '' stands out as the most polished song , I think ; none of the others seem as tight , well thought-out . I think they tried to tackle more concrete , literal subject matter -LRB- `` Prison Song '' being the best -RRB- , but they still sound so paranoid that I ca n't take the lyrics too literally ... not that that 's a bad thing.I think there 's still too much repetitive yelling , but there are more melodic , mellow , harmonious bits which are my favorite parts of the album . Besides `` Chop Suey , '' I think `` Atwa '' and `` Toxicity '' -LRB- which has been going through my head -RRB- stand out.I do n't think this CD is as good as the debut -LRB- where I 'd say the best songs were `` Suite-Pee '' and `` Spiders '' -RRB- , but I 'm still happy to have something new from SOAD . I hope they put out a third album a little faster , though ...
 System of a down is a great great band . The song Chop Suey has been spreading like fire all over the radio and Mtv , it has given the band new hope and will bring lots of more fans to the band . I highly recommend picking up this cd if you are into hard rock . But , if you listen to music at all , i recommend buying every tool cd known to man , because every tool song ever is incredible . SOAD is a great band , but nothing compared to my friends of Tool .
 Just purchased this cd and boy was i surprised ... I caught bits and pieces of the their first ablum and wasnt impressed but something told me , on the strength of `` chop suey '' video , to give this a chance . I am glad I did . Besides chop suey , Bounce and Forest are immediate standouts . Just what metal heads needed a band that isnt pretty looking bringing back guitar rifts and great lyrics . Hopefully , between At the Drive In and A system of a Down can spawn metal and hard rock back to where it belongs !
 Since System of a Down 's premier on the music scene nothing has been the same . System is consistently inventive and wild , and always either in the state of or pushing towards thought provoking . This album is no exception . A varied experience between the insane and the melodic , with a generally less dark feel than the first album . Serj 's randomly fluctuating vocals still stud every song and the interesting guitar style presented by Daron is relatively unchanged.The albums starts off on the right foot , with the insanely enjoyable Prison Song . The noted radio hit Chop Suey ! is of course a worthwhile song . X and Needles are both excellent , the Russian chant sound in Needles is instantly addictive . The album is loaded with traditional 2 minute or less System songs which pack all the instensity of a normal band 's 4 or 5 minute song into a very short period time.The album as a whole is less political than the first , bu that does n't stop it from having just as many loaded , razor-edged songs . The songs are just as critical of society and modern tendencies as they ever were.In short , anyone looking for another self-titled album is essentially in luck , with the exception of a very minor stylistic difference this album is almost perfectly like the first , and definitely more fun at parts , since it goes into less melodrama .
 Well , I was thouroughly blown away by System of a Down 's last album , and this one was even better . Some of the best hard rock I 've ever heard , this is the perfect kind of music to jump around and mosh to . The songs fit together on the CD quite well , and it feels more like a whole album than just a collection of songs . If you 've heard System of a Down before , this will blow you away . If you have n't , prepare to be shocked ; this is the best it gets in hard rock right here . This CD is a dish best served loud . ROCK ON !
 I bought Toxicity yesterday , after looking around for what felt like forever ! Finally , I got it and I do n't regret it . SOAD has evolved and has formed their own sound from all the other bands out there . Anyone could figure that out from there first CD but in their second , they have controled and harnessed their sound . The album is one of those where I never have to skip a song . A note on younger people
 best cd of the year forget about slipknot you must own this one i have listened to this cd over and over and it still does not get old i ca n't believe someone has finally made a cd where almost every song is great except for psycho for me but believe what everyone has written better than the first
 Ever since the first time I heard Chop Suey ! I could n't wait to get this cd . It 's 15 tracks if you include the bonus track and it 's around 45 minutes long . Toxicity starts off with one of the best tracks on the cd , `` Prison Song . '' I love this song and it has pretty cool lyrics . `` Needles '' is definately one of their heaviest songs ever . `` Chop Suey ! '' is their first single off of Toxicity . If I were S.O.A.D. I 'd make ATWA or Prison song the next single . Another sweet track is Psycho , in which Serj chants , ` Psycho , groupie , cocaine crazy ... ' Also , check out the bonus disk . Pretty cool stuff . The only reason this cd is considered explicit is probably the bonus disk and several drug referances . Buy toxicity now.dj ozell
 This album is just amazing . System of a Down are definately a band we are going to hear a lot about in the not so distant future . Toxicity is quite different to their self titled debut , the music and vocals are much better , this is definately a band whom has musically matured.This is a very strong album , Serj Tankians lyrics are good but it is his vocal style which captures my attention . These songs are suprisingly catchy and Serj 's range shines out , the guitar and drum work are commendable as well.This album is definately worth picking up . The strongest tracks are `` Prison Song '' , `` Forest '' and `` Chop Suey '' . The only weak track is `` Jet Pilot '' which really is why i did not give this album 5 stars.System of a Down are definately on an up .
 Personally , I think this album is far better than System of a Down 's self-titled debut . This one is more musical , with time changes , dynamics , and melodies outside of downtuned power chords . Also , this one is not as redundant as the first . The songs are all pretty much death-metal mania , but each one has a different touch to it . If you are new to this band , I would reccomend the first album because it 's a little easier to digest and get in to . If you are a seasoned veteran and you do n't have this album , you should be ashamed . Every song is simply amazing , filled with blistering guitars , machinegun drumming , sludging bass , and of course , Serj 's signature vocal `` stylings '' . The funny thing is that when he 's actually singing , he is an amazing vocalist . The best songs are `` Deer Dance '' , `` Needles '' , `` Jet Pilot '' , and of course , the epic `` Chop Suey ! ''
 After first hearing the single `` Chop Suey '' off of this CD I immediately had to run out and buy it . I took it home , sneaking the Parental Advisory Warning past my parents , put on my head phones and proceded to listen . Boy was I suprised ! I love Rage Against the Machine , so the first song `` Prison Song '' really got me hooked , everything after that was `` like butta '' . All of the songs are great , and the African Soul Drum Jam at the end was icing on the cake . It sure beats the jock strap off of Barbra Streisand .
 System 's brutally heavy , daringly experimental , angelically melodic second album is in a class of its own . The opening track `` Prison Song '' grabs your attention and gets you an immediate adrenaline pump . You 'll find yourself singing this song after a couple of listens . `` Needles '' , `` Chop Suey ! '' , `` Bounce '' and `` Arto '' also stand out in this album . Hook laden riffs abound in this album -- typical SOAD . SOAD is not just another heavy band -- they have something new to offer .
 This is definitley the best cd of 2001 , and prob one of the best ever . The cd flows great , every song is excellent and well placed from `` Prison Song '' to `` Aerials . '' This intelligent , hard-rocking opus is a must !
 Let me just say that System of a Downs new record Toxicity is nothing short of awesome . The CD starts of hard with `` Prison Song '' and leaves you begging for more . Once again the lyrics are focused on political issues and well thought out ideas which is a welcome change from the typical `` my girlfriend left me '' records . So if you 're into hard rock and meaningful lyrics pick up this CD . You wo n't be let down .
 oh my God . this cd is a work of pure genius and is far better than their brilliant debut . the songs here are alot more melodic with more of a singing emphasis , but still has very heavy music backing the vocals up . fav songs are prison song , deer dance , chop suey , science , and toxicity . go pick this cd up now if you are a true metal fan . lets hope these guys stick around for a long time to come .
 I thought I was taking a risk buying Toxicity just for the hit song , `` Chop Suey ! '' . Man , was I wrong . These guys are so intense and unpredictable . Every time I thought a song was getting all wussy , they start kickin ' ... again . Riding home from the store , I almost got into an accident cuz I was banging my head so hard . In this age of one-hit wonders , SoaD stands out from the rest with a CD where EVERY track RRRROOOOOOOCKS .
 This is the best album of 2001 . Hands down.As a metalhead I was impressed by Iced Earth 's latest effort but this is just mindbending.Buy this disc . Get a pogo stick . Prepare to smile .
 Ok , first off , I saw a reference to Evanescence . No . We do n't do that here . If you want to be taken serously , do n't talk about crappy pop bands in a SoaD page . Secondly , Nine Inch Nails sucks . They always did , and they still do . Thirdly , RAtM is a pretty good band , and there is no sence in trashing them , just because you do n't like the way Zac De La Roca raps in some songs . Next , SoaD is a good band , too . Do n't come in here throwing around your third grade insults and useless curses just cause you do n't like them , or do n't agree with someone else 's oppinion , no matter how wrong they may be . Next , no one will ever be right about getting an abortion , and you are a sick person for suggestion that the world would be a better place if someone had n't been in it . This is what everyone fears about Rock music . You guys have no oppinions of your own . You believe only what Zac or Serj tell you to believe . I like both of those bands , but I can honestly say I think their views are completely wrong . I 'm a Christian and I listen to Incubus , SoaD , RAtM , and plenty of other music that is n't necessiarly Christian , but I do n't let any of it warp my mind . Meagalomaniac -LRB- Incubus -RRB- did n't make me want to vote Kerry . Born As Ghosts -LRB- RAtM -RRB- did n't make me want to send money to any third-world countries . A.D.D. -LRB- SoaD -RRB- did n't make me curse the American government . You guys need to quit taking things so seriously and just let this stuff go.By the way , Toxicity is a great album . Serj Tankien cranks it up to ten on some songs , and down low on others . `` X '' is just amazing drumming at it 's best . `` Bounce '' will be stuck in your head for days . On the flip side , `` Jet Pilot '' is alot of noise the first several times you hear it . Once you get used to this album , you will enjoy it , though ...
 Why , oh WHY did this band have to add a second vocalist ? Whoever this guy is , he certainly can not stand up next to Serge . He might be good in another group , but he just does n't fit in here.As strange as it may sound , I think this album is too complicated . The first , with such simplistic -LRB- yet catchy -RRB- riffs , really caught my ears . This one ... well , it lacks the simple charm that SOAD 's first had . -LRB- Listen to `` Sugar '' and then `` Chop Suey '' if you want to know what I 'm talking about . -RRB- This is a solid album , for sure , but do n't expect D-Devil , Suite Pee , or any of the others . I 'm sure I 'll get the same old BS from people that support Metallica 's change of direction , but I really hope that SOAD do n't shift their sound so radically that it ends up sounding nothing like their first release . `` Bounce '' and `` Prison Song '' are among the best -LRB- nix the second vocalist on `` Prison '' -RRB- . ICQ
 Few cd 's exceed my expectations and Systems new release `` Toxicity '' does that and more . System has always had a style that was unique to them and it blossoms with this disc . From start to finish there is not a weak song and it gets better and better the more you listen to it . A must buy for everyone !!!!!
 The sophomore album from these Ozzfest vets is fast , loud , and a lot more provocative than most of their peers ' output . There 's a post-goth appeal to the music , which veers between black thrash and nomadic prog , and Serj Tankian is an appealingly dynamic frontman . There are moments of nu-metal excess , and at times it 's heavy for heavy 's sake , but on its core cuts -LRB- like the slippery `` Chop Suey '' -RRB- Toxicity is indeed lethal stuff .
 I bought this CD and now own two copies . The reason is that i have already worn lines in my first copy rendering my disc useless . This is easily the best alblum of the last three years , and I listen to a lot of music everything from Adema to zepplin -LSB- a to z -RSB- and honestly this record is an instant classic . Serj is a very talented man because he has a vision and scope which transgresses barriers of music . Now as far as the classification of this music , most people consider this metal but I consider it art rock , now hear me out . This record dos n't need to be grouped with the likes of slipknot and staind who we may eventually only remember the hit singles from . System has made an alblum that every song is memorable and for that fact they could very well be the next Beetles popularity wise but because some people do not like dramatic music or distorted guitar they will probably never be that big . Despite all this I reccomend this record to everyone , it has got a lot of great lyrics that are positive and descriptive of our society . Also as to the review that mentions that this is a political band , that is only partially true because even serj and malkian have both said that only a few songs are heavily political . So I tell you to buy this and really listen to the lyrics and eventually the music will satisfy you on a level that you can only begin to imagine .
 This CD is the best I have ever heard from Rock 'n' Roll !!!
 this cd is actually beautiful i personally hate metal but this cd is great i actually luv this cd bounce is a funny song chop suey and needles have some damn beautiful parts in em serj is a great singer get this cd now o and a good band is BUFFER THAN ROCK ...
 And i mean `` not sweet '' in a good way . This CD rocks to the max ; it will pound your brain into not submission . I bought it because of the song `` Chop Suey '' -LRB- but , um , what does that title have to do with the song ? -RRB- , which is one of the most beautiful songs ever . Because each song has so many different rhythmic changes and riffs , at first it 's hard to distinguish the songs from each other and the album sounds like one big mish mash . But after several listens the songs take on their own mind-blowing character ; I particularly like `` ATWA , '' with its beautiful , haunting refrain , and the song `` Science , '' with its repeated `` Spirit moves through all things , '' revealing the spiritual -LRB- in addition to the political -RRB- side to the album , like the part of `` Chop Suey '' where he quotes Jesus
 Rarely does a band like System come to the forefront of the underground metal world . They have struck gold -LRB- maybe even platinum -RRB- with their sophomore album , Toxicity . The amazing creativity behind the minds of Serj Tankian and Daron Malakian are nothing short of godly . The spellbinding blend of political messages and energy-driven music gives the listener an amazing new view of the world . Really ! `` Prison Song '' demonstrates as such . `` Science '' , my favorite song on the album , also gives personal views and provides insight into the mind of Tankian . Though i can not even compare it to their first album , Toxicity reigns near the top of the best metal albums ever ! No lie .
 I do n't even like metal but this album changed that , i ca n't believe i like this :-RRB- my opinion on the genre is worthless but i love this album .
 To be honest , I never really listened to System of a Down until recently . I 'd heard them before , but just did n't get into it . After hearing Chop Suey ! at a friend 's house , I decided to give the CD a try . All it took was one listen . In fact , I 've played this album for friends who 've never listened to them before , and all of them have loved this CD . System of a Down has a great sound that 's pretty unique -LRB- something that seems to be getting more and more rare these days -RRB- . It 's hard for me to pick any tracks that I like more than the others , because every track on the album is good . I would definately recommend this to those who liked SOAD 's earlier stuff and to those who like harder music that 's a little different .
 UN album qui d&eacute;m&eacute;nage ... . sa d&eacute;coiffe . . sa nous rend st&eacute;rille quelque 45 minutes de temps ... bravo cest du bon stock musical ...
 This CD is perfect ! It goes from mellow to strong metal sounds ! Lots of really cool screaming ! System of a Down will be around for years to come .
 This cd just blew my mind . i had never heard an album this good in awhile . I must of heared it a hundred times . This system album is terrific . this was really the first time i heard them . i do not regret getting this cd . it is different and original . sarj is a mezmerizing artist along with the other guys who hypnotize you with there very last song . let it take you on a trip . SYSTEM OF A DOWN ROCKS ! ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS !!!!
 Talk about non stop energy . System Of A Down 's sophmore release , `` Toxicity '' has people talking , and talking loud . Hailed as `` one of the best albums , EVER '' by many critics , SOAD shuts down the skeptics and the critics who thought they could not top their debut album.Not only does it top the album , it blows it out of the water . Serj and he boys have really done their job here , and offer a unique brand of metal that stands out from most of the nu-metal/rapcore sludge out there.A must-have for all rock fans , `` Toxicity '' will have you pumped up for a long time .
 SOAD 's 2nd album is a triumphant response to their 1st album . No one puts together an album of beats and riffs and lyrics like System of a Down -LRB- SOAD -RRB- . Although all the tracks are winners , I found `` Aerials '' , `` Chop Suey ! '' , `` Forest '' and others to be worth the price of the CD alone . For you `` behind the scene '' buffs , get the Limited Edition CD to see the making of this album .
 This CD is awesome . Every track is killer . You can listen to this CD over continously a thousand times . System of a Down rules . The Cd has great songs like Chop Suey , Prison Song , and Toxicity . This is a great CD to add to you 're collection . If you do n't have this buy it now .
 i love this cd ! i especially love Chop Suey . Recommendations for this song - Play on the bus to any field show or field tip , the results are usually reaaaallly funny . bnu 4evr .
 If it can be believed , this is the same four men that in 1998 released their self-titled album . That first album never really hinted at the level of maturity this band has reached . The songs are more unified wholes , and the lyrics are meaningful , even in their occasional humor.It is one anthem after another and easily the best album of 2001 . Probably too heavy for some , but just right for what America 's youth needs
 this cd kicks -LRB- ... -RRB- . all of the songs are worth listening to . I bought the cd for the song Chop Suey ! , but I liked the whole album . I got the limited editon cd . The behind the scenes/making of the album was pretty cool too.BUY THIS CD !!!!
 Excellent CD ! Alternative rock that blends great music , great vocals , with a hard hitting , important message ! I 'd recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys alternative rock music !
 I bought this CD based off of the fact that I loved Chop Suey ... and after the first listen I was very disappointed . It did n't remind me much Chop Suey . I liked about 4 or 5 songs , and found the rest of the CD too odd . I thought about shelving it . I listend to it again -LRB- as I always do with a CD I do n't like on the first try -RRB- and found myself liking more than half of it , with only a few tracks that I did n't like . After a 3rd listen , I found myself liking everything , and loving 4 or 5 tracks . The CD is now my favorite that I 've heard in years ... not a single bad track ... The originality , diversity , and raw songwriting talent of this band amazes me . I guess I have to go get their debut CD now ... I 'm definately a convert !
 This is the best CD that SOAD has ever released . Some people do n't like this album , but they DO NOT no what great music is ! I recommend this album to any rock fan . If you do not own this album and you like rock music you should stop reading and buy this RIGHT NOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 In the '80s and '90s Anthrax made metal fun to listen to . Nothing deep , nothing too philosophical , just fun music with a great tune . Now we 've got System of a Down , after a raft of depressing crap , and the fun is back . I mean , seriously , how can you not love a song that tells you to `` pull the tapeworm out of your a $ $ '' ? Besides that , they 're awesome musicians . Metal and melody do n't usually go well together , but System makes the tansition smoothly and well in each song , especially in `` Toxicity '' . Great band , great music , real talent here . Listen , enjoy , and try not to take it too seriously .
 oh yeah , fyi people this is charles t. so , KMEZ , old buddy . you think serj is a `` towelhead '' ? well let me just tell you that in all of my fifteen years , i have NEVER seen a more racist person than you . so you and your beloved Crack de la Roach can go get a room , so you can kiss his ass in there the way you are in front of all of us . Serj Tankian and Daron Malakian are an inspiration to music , because they invented their very own way of playing , unlike certain bands that sound EXACTLY the same as the ones before them * cough * RATM * cough * . so you can just f**k off and DIE .
 i think this album is the best album by system of a down and the song r the best that i have ever heard
 I too have thought about the meaning of Chop Suey ! I came up with the conclusion that the song is about the Columbine High School massacre . I know this probably is n't true but I have related each line to that possibility : `` Wake up grab a brush put on a little make up , hide the scars to fade away the shake up `` The day of the shootings the killers get up and put on their `` make up '' which is a metaphor for their combat gear and trenchcoats , this is their make up because it turns them into the video game characters they fantasised about being . With this gear on they are hiding the scars of being bully victims because now they are dressed in this gear they feel powerful and strong . `` Whyd you leave the keys up on the table , here you go create another fable `` They left the keys on the table because they were n't going to need them again because they were gon na die that day . Create another fable meaning they were gon na create a big news story that day that will be talked about for a long time . `` I do n't think you trust in my self-righteous suicide `` Their suicides were self righteous because they did it to make a point . People would n't trust in their suicides though because people think it was pointless . `` I cry when angels deserve to die `` They proclaim themselves to be the victims because they were bullied . The people who they killed are made out to be angels but they think they deserve to die because no one cares about them being bullied . `` Father into your hands I commend my spirit ... why have you forsaken me `` They kill themselves thus giving themselves up to God 's judgment but God forsakes them because they killed all those people , they are asking why because they consider themselevs to be victims also.Thats the great thing about SOAD songs you can interpret them anyway you like because they are so masked in metaphors . So KarlMarx you need to wake up & smell the coffee , SOAD are amazing , lyrically & musically . Malakian is an amazing composer and Serj writes amazing lyrics.Aerials is my fave SOAD song ever , its amazing , the strings , powerful riffs , and hypnotic vocals means I never tire of hearing it . SOAD is the greatest band on earth !
 In this day and age of music , it is quite hard to lump bands into a particular genre . Yes , System of a Down is catagorized as a `` hardcore '' heavy metal band , but this album definately defies the boundaries.TOXICITY is an excellent follow-up album . It shakes up the typical flow of a heavy metal album in that it begins with a soft acoustic guitar , only to delve into harsh power chords and screaming chants . To throw more of a mix into the album , the subtle sound of a piano can be heard . What makes this album so good , is that this strategic switching is constant throughout.Lead vocalist , Serj Tankian , stands out strong with his unique voice amongst the melodic chaos . It 's as if the band wants to present some type of structure to the music 's disorderly inclinations . Yet , the vocals do change throughout the album . It is quite extraordinary , making all of the songs really interesting to listen to.Most of the lyrics are quite laudatory and compliment the album 's sound and overall mood . The poetic verses of `` Prison Song '' are truly amazing , standing out on the album exceptionally well . Other awesome tracks include the viciously heavy `` Chop Suey , '' and wonderful guitar-heavy `` Shimmy '' and `` Science . `` TOXICITY is a very unique album in that System of a Down utilizes their middle eastern influences to defy their music format . There is a wonderful overall sound with several well-made songs . As the band tears down their music boundaries and revolutionizes their genre , you ca n't help but enjoy this album .
 system of a down are great!this cd is awsome . . TOXICITY , CHOP SUEY ! , ATWA , FOREST , PRISON SONG , SCIENCE , PSYCHO ANDAERIALS ARE THE BEST SONGS . . YOU SHOULD BUY THIS CD .
 This may say 4 stars but really its a 4 1/2 . Its a real good album and it gets you pumped up for somethings . After hearing about it and listening to it , My Tape Worm was telling me to buy this cd and so I bought it and here are the songs I think are cool . # 1-Funny Song about drugs 9/10 # 2-Pull that tape worm out of your ass 10/10 # 3-its okay but not the best 6/10 # 4-this ones ok also 7/10 # 5-TOO SHORT !! 5/10 # 6-This is a cool song but i dontt like the angels dying part 9/10 # 7-Another funny song and weird and about hos 10/10 # 8-This ones is my favorite hard rock song on here 10/10 # 9-Its ok but it sounds like he had a abused life 9/10 # 10-This is ok also but dont know what its about besides science 8/10 # 11-Shorter than # 5 but its a good song 9/10 # 12-Somewhere between the sane and silence scream/sardar and sardar !! its also one of my favorite songs 10/10 # 13-Psycho !! Groupie !! Cocane !!!!! Crazy !!!!! this is one of my all time favorite funny songs ever 10/10 -RSB- # 14-This song is the BESY DAMN SONG EVER !!! one minute its melodic then it turns into rock . Just think of the aerials in the sky dancing 100/10Anyway this cd is worth buying and Darons not cutting up on this one , but thats what made Mezmerize . Buy this with Mezmerize and solve 3/4 of the puzzle and expect for Hpnotize to be the complete part of the puzzle .
 Ok , I 've got ta be opinionated here . This is one of the best CDs ever made.Listening to it for the first time was a little strange . Among other quirky lyrics and seemingly out-of-place riffs -LRB- `` Chop Suey ! '' -RRB- , the misleading start to `` Prison Song '' threw me off a bit , but it soon became second nature as I listened to it more and more . The hard , powerful , metallic riffs will have you headbanging like there 's no tomorrow , and combined with Serj Tankian 's lyrics and compelling vocals -LRB- ranging from a throaty growl to a softer yet still amazing tone -RRB- you 'll be hooked and there 'll be no getting this CD out of your stereo . Tankian and Malarkian work so well together , and it shows in their harmonies , frequently utilized throughout the CD.As far as the individual songs go , they can range from deeply allegorical to brutally blatant in their point . Take , for example , `` Needles '' or `` Bounce '' -LRB- the first sings about a tapeworm but is about drug abuse , and the second seems to be about nothing more than a pogo stick when it 's actually about an orgy -RRB- ... and then you listen to such songs as `` Prison Song '' , where Tankian literally screams data to the background guitar . The songs tend to be somewhat confusing and random in their techniques
 SOAD are definitley in the category of best metal bands . Not only do they ROCK they also have intelligent lyrics to accompany it . To imagine SOAD take Rage Against the Machine and make them harder and faster like thrash metal almost . This is a highly reccomended CD ! . .
 Most nu-metal bands seem to have forgotten what metal is about . Fortunately , System have not . Despite being what most would call an old-school metal fan as well as an extreme metal fan -LRB- I listen Iron Maiden type stuff and death metal as well -RRB- I have to say that this is a great album . In fact , I 'm in question whether or not System Of A Down are even nu-metal . They certainly relate to what the scene used to be , despite having a very original sound . But with the nu-metal scene as it stands now with terrible rap-rock bands like Limp Bizkit , Linkin Park and Papa Roach at the forefront , System are very different.Firstly , guitarist Daron Malakian is n't just another detuned power chord merchant . This album has some technical stuff on it . Nothing special , but still some variety in his playing . Secondly , Serj Tankian has a great voice and experiments a lot with it . Thirdly , they do n't rap -LRB- thank God ! -RRB- . The best tracks include Prison Song , Needles , X , Chop Suey and Shimmy.This is n't as good as the debut though . The songs do n't really have their own individual character like they did on the self-titled , and Toxicity is n't as consistently good . Deer Dance and Boucne are all good tracks in themselves but they tend to merge together and all cover explored territory . On the debut the variety was greater and and there was a sense of individuality to each song . I would recommend the self-titled over this . Nonetheless , this is still a cool album.To the more elitist metal and rock fans who look down on nu-metal -LRB- I suppose that for the most part I 'm one of those ! -RRB-
 May I start out this very formal review by saying that ... THIS IS THE GREATEST ALBUM EVER TO CROSS THE ENTIRE MUSIC INDUSTRY !! I do n't care about Linkin Park or Korn or Limp Bizkit because after you listen to this CD you will never again have to return to that crap metal world of darkness . You want great insightful lyrics you 'll get that here , you want crazed guitars , great bass beats and awsome drumming you 'll get that here too . Seriously though this is such a great CD . S.O.A.D. is the best band ever!Prison Song 10/10 - Great political songNeedles 10/10 - Very Middle Eastern sounding guitars in this songDeer Dance 10/10 - AwsomeJet Piolet 7/10 - Not that this is a bad song it just dose n't fit inX 10/10 - Very good songChop Suey ! 10/10 - You 've all heard itBounce 9/10 - Very fast paced sogForest 10/10 - Most Mid-Eastern sounding songATWA 10/10 - Slow song but very meaningfulScience 10/10 - BreathtakingShimmy - Increadably fastToxicity 100/10 - The best song ever recordedPsycho 10/10 - It sounds just like the nameArials 99/100 - Second best song ever recordedPlease go out and buy this CD when your done reading this review . So go !
 SOAD seems to be a lot more focused on this album compared to their debut . I think this time they realized exactly what they wanted to do with it and went strait for the throat . The last thing I 'll say is do not believe the radio SOAD is much more than just an average band .
 just hearing ` chop suey ' once was enough for me to buy this album.From the intro of the prison song to the melodic and haunting aerials , this album is a mindblowing experience.It sounds like nothing ever done before and system mixing their roots with the music makes it all the more unique.I rate this as the best album in my collection.Don ' t hesitate to buy it !
 This CD has to be one of the greatest to be released lately . System of a Down -LRB- SOAD for short -RRB- have progressed quite nicely with this CD . This CD is different from most of the stuff out there now , which makes it good .
 If you 've read my Toxicity DVD review , you 'd know that in this review I 'll tell you about the music ... and I will ... Songs rated on a scale from 1-5 .1 . Prison Song-5 / 5-This is very political and hard , but can be melodic at times . Very good.2.Needles-1 / 5-Boring . Really Boring . Very bad .3 . Deer Dance-1 / 5-See # 2 . Very bad .4 . Jet Pilot-1 / 5-I 'm making this CD look bad , are n't I ? Very bad.5.X-1 / 5-Suprise ! Very bad .6 . Chop Suey ! -5 / 5-Finally ! OK , I 'm positive you 've heard this song so I wo n't review it . Very good.7.Bounce-3 / 5-The intro and choruses are cool , but it 's too short and the verses are ... strange ? Is that the word ? OK.8.Forest-5 / 5-The choruses in this are similar to Chop Suey ! 's choruses . Very mystical . Very good.9.ATWA-1 / 5-Sorry , SOAD . Very bad.10.Science-3 / 5-This has strange lyrics . Scary lyrics . Evil lyrics . OK.11.Shimmy-1 / 5-Shimmy co-co puff , give it to me now . Oh yeah . Very bad.12.Toxicity-5 / 5-Wortyh of having the CD named after it . A slower song , but it still kicks ... 13.Psycho-2 / 5-I do n't like this song , but I give it 2 because it sends out a message of positivenessnessness . Fair.14.Aerials-5 / 5-Awesome song . The longest here . Very good.OK , I recommend SOAD 's Toxicity if you like Slipknot , Mudvayne , Disturbed , or Dope ... !!!
 Rock n roll baby ... rock n roll ! System of a down has rejuviated my faith in rock n roll , or should I say `` NU METAL '' . I discovered these guys on the `` not another teen movie '' soundtrack and after hearing `` the metro '' a few times I ran out and bought their first album only to turn around and go get this one also ... now I can only be patient and hope that nothing bad happens to these Armenian badasses untill their next one ... After the split up of RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE I was hearbroken and bummed . System helped cure that pain!I had to listen to toxicity 2 or 3 times to fall in love like i did with their first one but i 'm stuck now ! BUY THIS ALBUM AND THE FIRST ONE ! Definite must haves .
 This album just pushes the hard rock envelope with amazing lyrics , loudness -LRB- must have for me -RRB- , overall madness -LRB- most important -RRB- , and just some CD that i think you should definetly go out to the store and buy . Yo you wont regret it .
 System of A Down ca n't be matched . They have awesome lyrics along with some of the best combinations of drums , guitar and bass . Throwing their own cultural sounds into their music is also a great twist . Any one who says this band is bad , they are probably just some poser loser listening to bands like Rage Against The Machine or Good Charlotte . This is the band of the new age . I urge you to buy this cd along with Steal This Album and the original self titled cd . Believe me , once you 've heard this band you wo n't be able to resist their greatness !
 This is how a CD should be . Every song is great , & trust me , it will definitely be one of the best CDs you ever own !
 I can say that this cd is just awesome . Not as good as their first but it still gets the same five stars . it really threw me off the first time i heard it because the different sound , its got some mid eastern influences and its a bit mellow but that just makes it better . Its still got some nice heavy tracks , some fast tracks , and even mellow just chill out and rock tracks . I 'm a big fan of System and this album makes me love this band even more . With songs like Atwa and Toxicity , chop suey ! Aerials , Science ect ect ect ... it really does have a song for everybody and they are all five star songs in my eyes . You must buy this cd if your into this band , even if you are n't i 'm sure after listning to it you 'll change your mind . Best CD right under the self titled but both hold their own weight .
 I feel system is on it 's way to developing its new sound , like Shavo said they were trying to do . The self titled was had a harder sound , Toxicity got a more melodic feel to it , and although songs from STA didnt make the Toxicity cut , they sound even more unique . Toxicity is great for those who are in between . If you do n't want hardrocking songs like P.L.U.C.K or Soil , and want more focused melodic songs like Chop Suey or Atwa then Toxcity is it . -LRB- It still has hard rocking tunes do n't worry -RRB- Overall a great album . Better to come though .
 The only review neccesary of this album can be summed into this : THIS ALBUM RULES !!!! I said yayah !!
 I thought that System of a Down would just be one of those bands that releases one good album and you dont expect to hear from again . Well , I was very wrong . This may not have been as good as their self titled release but it definatly comes close . This was a great follow-up album and it definatly prooved me wrong . After I heard this album I realized that System would be here to stay for a while . I was anticipating this album very much and was not at all upset . `` Chop Suey '' , `` Needles '' , `` Toxicity '' , `` Deer Dance '' and `` Aerials '' are flawless , perfectly written songs with great lyrics and great music . The only song that didnt really appeal to me was `` Bounce '' because I think they could do a little better with it but the rest of the songs make up for what they lack in `` Bounce '' . This is the best follow up album I 've ever heard with the exception of TOOL 's Undertow . Worth every star
 This album was the first I ever heard of System Of a Down and I was immediatley hooked , if you hav n't heared it then you should buy it and listen to it . The best songs are
 This album seems short but other than that its pretty good . I love the songs Chop suey , Bounce , Toxicity , and Shimmey . All in all , pretty good CD , i recommend buying it .
 this is a great rock album ! It 's not nu-metal , not heavy , not trash , not punk ... . it 's everything together , all styles mixed up in a wonderful sound ! One of the best band I listened to in the last years . Last time I had the same feelings was as I listened to Slayer 's `` Reign in blood '' ... . a shocking experience ! Buy it !
 See the problem with this album is , it 's just too good . I normally listened to alternative rock , then I heard Chop Suey ! on MTV and fell in love with this Nu-Metal phenomenon . The album opens with the solid and powerful anti-government `` Prison Song '' . The lyrics are just so well thought out and seem to make no sense at first . After you look at the lyrics and analyze them , they still make no sense . It seems like incoherent babble , but it really works well . Song for song was the best album I had ever listened to in a long time . There are a few songs like X and Jet Pilot that do n't fit , but the other tracks more than make up for it . Chop Suey ! , Toxicity , and Aerials were all really big radio and music video hits , but there is so many more hits on this CD . Forrest and Psycho are two excellent examples of System 's immense musical talent . If you do n't own this album , then go out and buy it . Now ! Forget Korn , Disturbed , and Slipknot , System of a Down blows em all away ! -LSB- Bo -RCB- ~
 This cd is very well put together . If you read my other reviews you 'll know I do n't do this often . I 'll rate each song .1 -RRB- Prison Song - Very political , good lyrics , cool intro 10/102 -RRB- Needles - I did n't like this one very much the lyrics are lacking , but they get the point of the song stuck in your head , that 's for sure 4/103 -RRB- Deer Dance - I like this one it has great music , the guitars sound really cool 9/104 -RRB- Jet Pilot - The low point on this cd I DONT GET WHAT ITS ABOUT !!!!!!! 3/105 -RRB- X - Not bad , it 's got a nice tune , the lyrics are like Needles -LRB- keep repeating the same thing to make a point -RRB- 8/106 -RRB- Chop Suey - Definitely a cd highlight , for sure top three on cd7 -RRB- Bounce - Not very good in any way , the lyrics are mostly comic , serj sounds like hes drunk , so it 's kinda funny ... 5/108 -RRB- Forest - Not much to say , I 've never liked it much but others do 6.5 / 109 -RRB- Atwa - Starts slow but explodes later on , one of the best three on here 10/1010 -RRB- Science - Kind of like Forest it 's only ok for me 7/1011 -RRB- Toxicity - Great song , great lyrics , amen . 9/1012 -RRB- Shimmy - If it was 4 minutes long it would be the best song on the cd , but it 's only 2 8/1013 -RRB- Psycho - Vocals are good in this one , it starts out kind of techno style 9/1014 -RRB- Aerials - Maybe the best song on the cd , cept there 's this weird outro , it 's this primitive music with people chanting , very strange 10/10 -LRB- without chanting -RRB- 8/10 -LRB- with chanting -RRB- Overall great cd it may not sound like a 5 star cd but trust me it is .
 THIS CD KICKS SO MUCH ASS!THESE ARE ALL THE SONGS .1 .

 I think this is a pretty good band . I don ; t get the point of the music -LRB- what the poit their getting accross is . -RRB- I 'm proably to young to understand but of all a good band . It 's probaly not for everyone though . This is a great album for heavy rock fans !
 This CD has quickly become a classic and a must-have for all rock listeners . System of a Down has really improved their sound and lyrics . This CD is amazing from start to finish ! 1 . Prison Song - 6/10 - This is one of the weaker songs on the CD . Serj 's vocals are pretty good , but this song is pretty repetitive .2 . Needles - 9/10 - This is where the CD really starts . This adrenaline-packed track is full of growling , loud riffs and a strong drumline . The bridge , where Daron sings , is a really contrast the echoing chaos of the rest of the song .3 . Deer Dance - 8/10 - This is a good , better-than-averadge song . It 's got a good chorus and a fast-paced verse .4 . Jet Pilot - 8/10 - Very fast , confusing song . Says something about a horse , but the rest is like utter nonsense . A little repetitive , but since when has repitition sounded so good ? 5 . X - 7/10 - Ok song , not as good as the songs so far -LRB- except Prison Song -RRB- . Pretty basic , catchy , but nothing really stands out .6 . Chop Suey ! - 10/10 - One of the best tracks on this CD . This is the first single , but it does n't stop its utter onslaught of awesomeness upon your ears . The bridge is the best part .7 . Bounce - 8/10 - Always got ta have a song about a `` Pogo stick '' . A lot like Jet Pilot , but a little better . Very good background vocals in the chorus .8 . Forest - 10/10 - My favorite song on this CD . Awesome chorus , awesome verses ! The lyrics are really good . You can System stayed awake late one night perfecting these ... 9 . ATWA - 6/10 - My least favorite song . Nothing really stands out , not very catchy , no real System-like fast beats or anything .10 . Science - 8/10 - Good song . The riffs are solid and precise , and there 's a little bit of Armenien influences in it .11 . Shimmy - 9/10 - This song gets my adrenaline pumping . It 's a short song , but it 's still awesome .12 . Toxicity - 10/10 - Second single , solid song . Great drumline . More of a mellow song -LRB- no screaming -RRB- , but still hard and it delivers a powerful chorus .13 . Psycho - 9/10 - Great song ! A little repetitve , but in a good way . Powerful , strong , and good .14 . Aerials - 10/10 - Third single , but still awesome .
 With one of the most impressive sophomore releases of the last decade , once again SOAD has proved to be the only hope for `` nu-metal . '' A classic album .
 great cd , perfect songs great riffs and gutair speed that rivals even the great Kerry King of Slayer , if you like bands that follow there own style then you must check these guys out . Also by there first cd `` System Of A Down '' . If you like those cds check out Reign In Blood by Slayer . They too have followed thereown style for close to 20 years and im sure you would love them if you like these guys
 This album ... well it just rocks plainly said . Nonsense turns into a great musical experience for the ears . Shavo sucks as a bassist but everyone else is good , especially John . Short , but great .1 . Prison Song - Awww yeah . Great intro , awesome song , it had the works . 10/102 . Needles - Rules . Just rules . 10/103 . Deer Dance - Bang your head until you get a concusion . Fun ! 10/104 . Jet Pilot - Starts out fast , middle is fast , ends fast . Wow . 9/105 . X - Not bad ... . very short . 9/106 . Chop Suey - At first I HATED this song . Then I started to like it . 8/107 . Bounce - I 'm always tired after this song . Probably because I jump around everywhere when I here it . 11/108 . Forest - Longest song on album at 4:00 . Wow , that 's sad . still rules . 9.5 / 109 . ATWA - Rules . 10/1010 . Science - My least favorite subject and my least favorite song on this album . Wow . 6/1011 . Shimmy - Not good either . 7/1012 . Toxicity - Good single . 10/1013 . Psycho - Go Psycho Groupie Cocaine Crazy ! 10/1014 . Aerials - Sucks . 7/10
 Anyone who likes Limp Bizkit and Tool but suspects that these guys are basically talentless screamers needs to dig up System of a Down . Intelligent metal is n't an oxymoron ... here is an abulm that shakes your bones while stimulating your mind . Amazing .
 This , if u enjoy rock and/or metal music should be the perfect album for you . System of a Down is a pretty kool group and they definetely sound like they know what they 're doing in this album . Ill give a quick runthrough of the songs , 1 being worst , and 10 being best . of course this is all my opinion , and u may think otherwise , so dont take everything i say and believe me , cuz u may think otherwise . the only way to know is to go buy the cd ! anyway here we go :1 . Prison Song 9/10 Good lyrics , good music . All-around just a good song , though its not perfect .2 . Needles 9/10 Another good song that sings about `` tapeworms '' controlling Serj -LRB- vocals for SOAD -RRB- but the `` tapeworms '' actually referring to drugs and such . So good vocals , good guitars and drums .3 . Deer Dance 8/10 this one 's about how those with higher authority enjoy `` pushing little children with their fully automatics '' its an ok song , and has some good stuff in it .4 . Jet Pilot 7/10 probly has the weirdest lyrics of any song on this cd , though its still an ok song , but kind of short .5 . X 6/10 the drummer John does a really good job in this song in my view , but other than that its not a whole lot . same or similar lyrics repeated the whole song .6 . Chop Suey ! 10/10 probly the best song on the album . awesome guitars , drums , lyrics ... EVERYTHING ! 7 . Bounce 7/10 another song with weird lyrics cause it talks about a pogo stick and having some kind of pogo stick contest with his girlfriend and her friends . its also an ok song . nothing really bad music-wise . nothing all that good either .8 . Forest 9/10 i think serj did a good job with lyrics in this song , and i like how it really starts to pick up speed in the end . all around kool song ,9 . ATWA 8/10 i think this song is supposed to be about life through the eyes of charles manson . anyway , its pretty good , lyric wise and sound wise .10 . Sciene 9/10 a kool song with an armenian/arabish feel about how science is ruining our world . pretty interesting song .11 . Shimmy 8/10 another shorter song . i cant really define a topic for it , but its ok .12 . Toxicity 7/10 good guitars , but its just kinda slow to me throughout the song . and it seems to pick up pace but lose it as soon as u start to notice the change , but still an alright song .13 . Psycho 6/10 another ok song about groupies on cocaine . its kinda long , but its not really all that good14 . Aerials 10/10 an awesome song . it can somehow be slow and fast at the same time , though i cant explain it , but its got great lyrics and sound .15 Armenian Funeral Song 10/10 this is a funeral song that comes on after aerials ends . its a pretty kool song that reminds us where all of the SOAD members came from . Its an arabic song really , kind of a kool ending to this albumwell thats all for this album . I guess that means , including the funeral song , it would score a 123/150 which is pretty good . anyway , thanks for reading this if u actually read all of it . Cya .
 I love benji 55 they are the best band eva !! check em out ... www.angelfire.com.punk3 / benji55
 I have just recieved my Toxicity disc from Amazon , and WOW ! I am totally blown away by this band !! If you are a metal fan in the least , I highly recommend this group . From beginning to end it is non-stop thrash ! Buy this disc ... NOW ... What the heck are you waiting for ?????
 I believe that these guys reall need to shut up . they are so addicting and it is one great cd . BUY IT . The songs are great from begining to the end , and you will eventually love this cd . -LRB- ... -RRB- BUY IT . I WOULD GIVE IT 10 STARS ! **********
 Like the title says , this is the best CD ever . I do n't know why all those people out there who hate good music talk trash about System of a Down . I 'd like to see the stuff they listen to . It 's probably some stuff they found in their parent 's record collection .
 This album is brilliant ... go out and buy it right now . Seriously , i bought it and have n't taken it out of my car cd player once . . it has beautifully written music and great lyrics . But what use are good lyrics if the singer does n't give all he 's got ... not a worry for SOAD though ... great harmonizing and grunts and all that great stuff ... Aerials and Chop Suey are still my faves . .
 Although Chop Suey is getting overplayed , and this album is getting SOAD a LOT of attention , and the lead singer 's voice is kind of annoying when he screams , this album ROCKS ! The second I heard the first guitar strum in track 1 I knew this was gon na be a great cd . I ca n't say my favorite tracks , I like em all ! I still have yet to check out SOAD 's first cd - look for my review for that soon .
 This is easily the one of the best cds I have ever heard . Although the first time you listen to it chances are you will go right to Chop Suey . Good song but by far not the best . After you listen to it 2 or 3 times you are addicted . And you take Chop Suey with all the others . The lyrcics are very weak but it does not matter at all because the dynamics in Serj 's voice will blow you away . And I promise you , if u like hard core speed metal then this cd will never leave your player .
 It 's been 3 years since System of a down released their self titled debut album . Finally the wait is over for the new album , and the verdict is simply put amazing . From start to finish `` Toxicity '' is a non-stop all out music blitzkrieg , taking Nu-Metal places it has never been before . Lead singer Serj Tankian supplies amazing vocals and lyrics , John Dolmayan rips through every song like a sharp knife with his drum work . Daron Malakian 's guitar work smashes your ears to pieces and Shavo Odadjian 's bass playing is some of the best I 've heard in a long time . Top tracks are `` Prison song '' , `` Deer dance '' , `` X , `` Chop suey ! '' , `` Bounce '' , `` Forest '' , `` Shimmy '' , `` Toxicity '' & `` Psycho '' .
 Whoever has he original cd , can you please send information that includes the tracks and how long they are . and how long the entire cd is . This would be greatly appreciated . Thanks.By the way , this cd rocks and i definately recomend it to anyone who like rock music !
 ever had an eargasm ? well if u want one ... buy this CD ! Its so incredible i loved the first but Toxicity takes the cake ! ATWA is possibly my most fav song . check it out

 From the album 's ferocious opening backslap to the sludgy riffing of `` Aerials '' , Toxicity is the definition of aural beatdown . At first listen , the drums and guitar seem to share the simple goal of liquifying your brain , and the vocals grate against that wall of sound to horrid effect . The music and lyrics rush quickly by , and the many interesting facets of the songs ' construction and execution are gone before you can figure them out . Repeated listens further illuminate the musical ornaments and twists on the album -LRB- at least , they did so for me -RRB- , but nothing ever detracts from the full-force attack incited by every single song.An open mind is essential for a full understanding of Toxicity . Some listeners will revel in its heaviness without ever locking on to the more subtle elements , and some will distance themselves from this music because its violence is too much for them . I pity both groups . Toxicity has something to say about music and about the modern world , and while the two messages can not be fully absorbed as a pair , neither should be overlooked .
 I 'm more of a Creed , Greenday , Blink 182 kind of a fan , but i LOVE this CD . When i first heard `` Chop Suey ! '' on MTV , i thought it was some annoying metal band , so i changed the station . Then my friend started talking about SOAD all the time so i downloaded a couple of songs . I got `` Science '' , `` Chop Suey ! '' and `` Toxicity '' and liked them all -LRB- to my surprise -RRB- . So I bought the CD . I have fallen in love with it . I take it everywhere . My favorite songs are
 TOXICITY by System of a Down certainly reigned supreme in the year 2001 . While another great band nipped closely at their heels -LRB- Tool -RRB- , System of a Down certainly makes the band of the year on my list . Their music truly infilitrates a bit of your soul and keeps doing so until you reach enlightenment in a surreal sense . The music on this album contributes to giving you a proverbial high all without the need of toxic -LRB- pun intended -RRB- substances . So , for now , let 's make a quick rundown of this supreme album 's tracks :1 . Prison Song - 2/10 - When I first put this album in after hearing ` Chop Suey ! ' on the radio and already a fan after P.L.U.C.K. and Suite Pee from their self-titled debut , I was extremely disppointed . The convential means to an end which makes System of a Down a band in themselves was gone and now we were left with a proverbial shell . The lyrics were quite rash and forward , and the beat lacked that trademakr System of a Down feel . Extremely disappointing .2 . Needles - 9/10 - What an excellent song ! Has all the trimmings of typical System of a Down faire and truly sets the stage for what the remainder of the album will be like .3 . Deer Dance - 8/10 - Quite powerful lyrics , but lacking a tad in the enuff section musically , this song also displays Serj 's immense musical talents .4 . Jet Pilot - 9/10 - Better then Tracks 1 and 3 , but not as good as 2 , Jet Pilot houses within it all the great thrash metal trademarks that all System of a Down fans truly appreciate .5 . X - 10/10 - Terrific example of thrash metal that truly rings in the entire System of a Down genre . Do n't be surprised if this song is n't played over the radio waves in the next few months .6 . Chop Suey ! - 10/10 - No reason rating it . You 've all heard it and we all love it . The BEST single of the year 2001 , followed by Tool 's Schism offering from earlier in the year .7 . Bounce - 9/10 - Gets docked a point because of the lack of seriousness which is evident in all SOAD songs , but still remains on the top because of its extreme talent and range that it exhibits .8 . Forest - 7/10 - A good song , but definately not a stand-out among the album . This song would be a knockout ! in a band who lacks the talent of SOAD , but in this album , it just oes n't shine .9 . ATWA - 100/10 - No , that is n't a typo . This song , excuse my American dialect , kicks so much ... ! The lyrics and delivery are truly what makes this song the best song of the year 2001 . If it becomes a single , it will probably take SOAD to a whole new level .10 . Science - 7/10 - Refer to Forest . Good song , but again , it lacks in many places , mainly in the power that is usually evident in Serj 's voice .11 . Shimmy - 7/10 - Same as Tracks 8 and 10 , Shimmy lacks the necessary seriousness , harshness , and power of SOAD .12 . Toxicity - 10/10 - After two decent tracks , this song punches you right in the face and screams into your ears . The power of Serj 's vocals , and the talent of Daron 's guitar are what make the title track the current best single of the year 2002 , as a matter of a fact , one of a handful of actually decent tracks this year .13 . Psycho - 10/10 - After you are blown away by Toxicity , Psycho keeps you away with this huge offering . The lyrics are what truly make this anti-drug anthem a hit in my book . Another song that deserves to become a single just for the exemplary offering of Daron in the final moment 's solo .14 . Aerials - 10/10 - The last track seals the stamp of my approval on this album . The song truly is set forth with the extremely powerful ... well , everything . The only thing that might lack in this song is the power behind the drums but is more then made up for in the rest of the album . Another song that must be a single . NOTE
 AMAZING !! This is a great CD . It is nice and hard but still keeps Melody . Making it Catchy Metal . NICE !! Favorite Songs
 this cd is excellent . system of a down shows that you can rock , and still not sound the same as everyone else . in a maket saturated with cry-baby-middle-class - ... -LRB- see fred durst and aaron lewis -RRB- it is refreshing to hear this cd . they are loud , but actually have something to say other than '' ... you , i rule '' -LRB- see fred durst again -RRB- and '' ... you dad '' -LRB- see arron lewis -RRB- . and they are n't afraid to incorperate different instruments and sounds into their music , or have songs that , gasp , no way , sound different . also , they get their point across without the use of constant profanities , showing that if you use that much profanity , you obviously did n't put much effort into your lyrics .
 This CD is absolutely a great buy . From `` Prison Song '' to `` Aerials , '' it 's one of those CDs that only show up once in a great while . This CD is a great pick for any heavy metal fan . Though the sound may be a bit different from their first CD , Toxicity is still great . I ca n't say that I dislike any of the songs on this CD , but in my opinion the songs that really stand out are `` Prison Song , '' `` Chop Suey ! , '' `` Forest , '' `` Toxicity , '' and `` Aerials . '' -LRB- My favorite being `` Forest . '' -RRB- The unique vocal style of Serj Tankian and the out of this world guitar riffs of Daron Malakian just add to this great CD . You will never get sick of this CD .
 The very first time I heard Chop Suey on the radio I loved it . I have put off buying the CD because usually the whole album is not that good , and eventually you get tired of the radio hit . But Chop Suey just keeps getting under my skin , so I finally bought the album . Man I love it ! I listen to Creed , Godsmack , Disturbed , Rage Against the Machine , POD , and Aerosmith quite a lot . I think this album is most similar in sound to some of Disturbed . Although Creed will continue to be my favorite band , I am VERY impressed with SOAD . I have listened to the disc over and over , and it just gets in your blood , and charges you up . Just heard on the radio today they are coming to Austin . Sign me up .
 Over the past few years , it seems that real rock has been fading from sight and music like bubble gum pop and weak rock acts have been controlling the airwaves . 2001 was a time when great hard rock like sevendust , nickelback and staind began getting a great deal of attention . System of a down is one of those groups . They mix an interesting combination of politics suchas as prison with humor like bounce with some stuff that is a little more personal like forest . The band plays fast and hard putting a great deal of intensity into what they do which can be seen the great quality of songs they have written for toxicity
 This cd and this band are both the only things I respect in all nu metal , the rest is a terrible joke , however this band is awesome , their music concept is really diferent from the others and the lirycs are inteligent , the mix between agressive vocals , some good guitar riffs and some melodic parts all at once makes this record a memorable surprise , in a kind of '' metal '' that the bad taste is what rulez ... , System Of A Down is the ONLY great one in nu metal .
 This album was the best thing ever to happen to S.O.A.D. . It has the best S.O.A.D. song 's made to date -LRB- even better than some songs on `` Mezmerize '' -RRB- . This is what put them on the map . A lot of people probably did n't know who S.O.A.D. before this album . Toxicity is by far their best work yet , with songs like `` Chop Suey '' , `` Toxicity '' , `` Deer Dance '' , and `` Arials '' all becoming names of songs that even MTV watchers would recognize . I believe even `` Mezmerize '' may not even be able to top this one .
 Toxicity was the first album I had heard of System of a Down . Naturally , at first , I was shocked , but it grew on me overnight . System of a Down is by far THE most original and creative band I have ever heard . Chop Suey ! , A.T.W.A , Toxicity , Science , Aerials , Prison Song , etc. ... , this album will completely blow you away ! Ignore any Parental Advisories on this , or any System of a Down album , because they are full of profound messages that cleary , and sometimes , bluntly , adress real life issues . Some People think that System of a Down is an unoriginal band . Some people think they are untalented . Well , some people are idiots . Rock on , System of a Down !
 This album was my introduction to this band . I do n't know what the one-star reviewers are thinking , but it 's one of my favorite albums ever.He can sing ! It 's punk rock-esque so that 's why he 's sings so fast , which is really hard to do actually -LRB- try it -RRB- . In addition , he -LRB- and the rest of the band -RRB- can switch the tempo of the song from really fast and punky to slow and dramatic , yet it still flows ! This element of this band 's music is what makes them unique and interesting to listen to.Their other albums such as Steal This Album ! are faster , which is also fun and great , but I like how Toxicity incorporates more slow , melodic elements with the fast tempos , which creates a passionate , dramatic tone , which renders the songs gripping . I think this `` gripping '' tone makes this band stand apart from most popular bands whose lyrics and music are vapid and lack feeling and personality . This band takes major risks that most bands do n't , and most of SOAD 's experiments are successful.By the way , many people say that many of this album 's lyrics are `` left of center '' . That 's true , but they 're are also surprisingly conservative elements as can be heard in `` Aerials '' and `` Science '' and even `` Chop Suey ! ''
 Toxicity is a very good album by System of a Down but it 's a huge disappointment for me after hearing their debut album . That cd was much more chaotic , fun , and the guitars were much better , there 's nothing even close to `` Soil '' on here . Daron 's riffs seem so much more monotonous and boring on here , which can easily be heard on songs that start out heavy like `` Jet Pilot '' and `` Deer Dance '' and in the choruses of songs like `` ATWA '' and `` Forest '' . On a more positive note this is a little more concentrated than the debut , there 's nothing like `` Mind '' on here which really was a waste of a 6 minute song . During the quieter parts and such the guitar playing is good , as seen in `` ATWA '' and `` Chop Suey '' which is n't something I can say as much about the debut.As a conclusion I 'd say this is a good first album to get for System of a Down , either this or Mezmerize which shows the band is really good but not in full force like the debut which I recommend getting by all means , but you wo n't appreciate it if you do n't get this first.Best songs here include Prison Song , Chop Suey , ATWA , Science and Shimmy , the other 2 singles are n't bad either but not as good
 Toxicity is the first Soad album that I heard . At first listen , it was random and unlikable . But it grows on you , much like mold on an old sandwich . Toxicity is awesome , taking what made the first great and continuing in consistency.The album opens heavy with Prison Song , Needles and Deer Dance blasting the hell out of any speakers . Jet Pilot is a little obscure in both rhythm and lyrics , but should catch on . Same with X. Chop Suey , the title track , and Aerials are the radio hits , with the first two being absolute classics . I think Aerials is weak and overplayed , while the outro Arto is just unneccessary . Shimmy is the best song on the album while Science and Forest are cool too . I 'm giving it a 4 because the songs do n't offer the same variety and depth as those from the first , although ATWA makes for a nice softer song and Psycho is pretty insane . And for those that think Bounce is stupid and random , try checking around for what the lyrics actually represent -LRB- via old interviews -RRB- . Then you 'll just call it random .
 When comparing this to their new album Mesmerize , I realize that Toxicity blows it away . It was no wonder why this album sold millions of copies worldwide . All four members of the band are at the top of their game in this album . Going from the very political Prison Song to the melodic hit Aerials , the album is very varied and shows how SOAD is not consistent . It 's a good thing that the guitarist , Daron Malakian , did n't sing on this one leaving Serj to be in all of his glory . However , his guitar playing on this one is quite good . The bass just chugs the songs along and the drumming is amazing and crazy . There a couple of weaker spots on this album I have to admit like X , Jet Pilot , and Shimmy , however the highlights , including the melodic climax and my favorite SOAD song Chop Suey , the amazing title track , Forest , and the ender , Aerials clearly make up for that . If you want to get into System of A Down , this should undoubtedly be your first album to get .
 After most of the day pounding Avril Lavigne and the Backstreet Boys on other reviews , I come upon one of my personal favorite bands
 System of a Down started off as a rather clumsy band with their s/t-debut . This album took them in a new direction . Instead of the crazy , disjointed `` noise '' of their first album , this one is a beautifully-produced , heavy-yet-melodic , and truly powerful thrash -LRB- not `` nu '' -RRB- metal album . But before I go any further , I would like to make a little rant
 This is a truly remarkable album . I had no idea who SOAD was until I heard the song needles at a friends house . I was amazed ! Serj has such a unique vocal palette , and the lyrics are great . This band strikes me as odd how they sing some of their songs , as if they were merely speaking , but i think this is unique , and easily an adding factor to the experience . it 's things like that that make bands unique . This CD should not be missed . there is no filler , and every song is good and has a place . Needles , prison song , deer dance , and toxicity are my all around favorite songs . Go out and buy it !
 Dear God this has to be the greatest album of the year . No other band sounds anything like System of a Down . System has a unique sound and style all their own and this is ever more aparent in Toxicity . They match incredible lyrics with amazing instrumentals and vocals puting their original album to shame .
 all the soad haters really should go get a life instead of attempting to review an album they probably listened with alot of prejudice no matter what anyone says this is a master piece enought people say so to make that a reality ok its not everones cup of tea but neither is any album by any artist right to the album the album is a phenominan and highly innovitive see my review of the album under all reviewsthe bonus material is great and makes you yearn to see system of a down live truely wonderful
 system of a down have proved one of the most innotovive and controversal bands of there generation ever since there 1998 debut they have captiveted listens witch surprisingly origonal `` nu metal `` music my dad brought this cd after hearing the the first single chop suey i have been captivated by this album and am gon na list the songs and what i thought of themprison song-good album opener but wears thin after a few listens 7/10deer dance 9/10 realli good song wacky and heavy at the same time and a beautiful section in the middle where everything goes guitejet piolet 5/10 to loud to devoid of melody for me but does have its qualitiesx 3/10 like the last one cept worsechop suey 2000000/10 this song is a classic beautiful chorus agressive verses and a wonderful climax at the endbounce 7/10 i like it a bit wierd something bout a pogo stick may be something else because live he describes it as pogo d ** kforest 10/10 like this its bouncier than bounce in my opion great songatwa 8/10 i love the verse and the chorus comes as such a shock it propells you off your seatscience 10/10 this song rocks great riff reminds me a bit of the giants of metal very very good and good middle section quite wierd very system of a downSHIMMY 9.5 / 10 2 short would of got the full 10 if a bit longer great fun love to shimmy to the record while listeningtoxicity 9/10 has alot to it melody predominatly very heavy very good 2 listen to in the bath -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- Psycho 10/10 love it great energy has melody as well a feature of system its what makes them in my mind the greatest band of all timeAERIALS 12/10 i love this song it is so so so so so good ive never been so haunted by anything in my life it kinda creeps up on you amazingARTO 8/10 nice way to end an album hidden track scared mi first time i herd it thought id passed to the after liferanks first in all the albums for a reference in my opinoin they line up like thisToxicity 10/10system of a down 9.8 / 10mezmerize10/10steal this album 9.8 / 10all the albums have a charm of there own but this is the place to start this album has defined a genre and has made `` nu metal '' acceptable even thou they can bi put under any category
 ONE OF THE BEST CD 'S I EVER HEARD THE MUSIC IS GREAT AND SO ARE THE LYRICS THEY ARE NOT AFRAID TO EXPRES THERE OPINIONS
 This album kicks ASS !!!!!!! I love it . I have n't heard any of their other ones , but this one still kicks ass ! All the songs have awesome beats to them and they are really cool . They are all worth listening to . `` Chop Suey '' , `` Bounce '' , `` Toxicity '' , `` Prison Song '' , and `` Aerials '' are my favorites . Well all the songs are my favorites , but I pretty much like these the best ! I suggest this be the first album of theirs to get ! You will totally enjoy this cd ! Who would n't ??? I do n't think I have anything else to say about this album , other than it 's a must for any System of A Down fan !! And it kicks some major ASS !!!
 These guys know what they 're doing . This is not an amateur attempt at music , believe me . The pure talent and energy can literally be felt when you listen to the album all the way through . If you liked what you heard on the radio and are thinking about buying this CD , think twice . Although it is a masterpiece of modern music , SOAD 's typical sound is nothing like Aerials or Chop Suey . Try downloading Needles or Shimmy or Psycho before jumping into any impulsive buys that might end up with you being freaked out by the sometimes disturbing , psychotic screams that make `` Toxicity '' so unique within it 's genre.The songs I most strongly recommend are : -- Needles -LRB- wait for when the song slows down for a sec and it goes `` I 'm ... sitting in my room , with a needle in my hand , waiting for the tomb of some old dying man ... just waiting for the tomb of some old dying MAN ! ... '' One my favorite moments on the whole album . Oh , I also love the line `` And you slither up to me in your pimpin majesty . '' I have no idea why , though . -RRB- -- Deer Dance -LRB- My absolute favorite moment however comes during this song . `` a deer dance , invitation to peace . War staring you in the face . -LRB- dressed in black -RRB- ... a little boy smiles , it 'll all be well , a little boy smiles it 'll all be well ! '' Beautifully done . -RRB- -- Bounce -LRB- These guys got some humor too . Sure , the repetiveness of this song gets old after awhile , but it 's a great way to wake up in the morning . -RRB- -- ATWA -LRB- Starts out slow , but does n't stay that way for long . Best part

 If you want some good intense , brutal , and energy-filled metal , this is the album for you . Still doing well on the billboards and selling like crazy , System of a Down 's `` Toxicity '' is one spectacular album.Every song is great and filled with energy . Very political at times as well . Much so like Rage Against the Machine , except imagine them all on speed . And the lead singer can sing beautifully , or yell and growl like hell . All songs are for the most part very fast-paced . The guitars are great , the druming is great , and most of all , the vocals are outstanding.Favorite songs include `` prison song , '' `` needles , '' `` chop suey ! '' `` bounce , '' `` science , '' shimmy , '' `` aerials , '' and `` toxicity . '' But trust me , every song is great.One weak side is since the songs are so fast-paced , they are rather short , making the CD length not that long . But all of that is made up by including some great music and songs.So if this sounds like something you would like , then check out `` Toxicity , '' a.s.a.p. It 's a great album to listen to when you 're driving , but if you have this bad boy in , everybody else on the road better make sure they know how to use the gas pedal , because your foot will be pressing on it HARD ! `` Look out , you fools ! Get out of my way !!! ''
 It 's just Narley . Only for those days when you 're just in the mood for some energetic and bugged out tunes . Inervision and Toxicity are the best song they 've ever made yet in my opinion and based on what I 've heard from SOAD . I personally agree with some of the reviewers about heavy metal . I feel that it 's a way of expressing your feelings on life and it 's more passionate and positive then rap . Heavy metal gives me so much motivation at a level where it 's consistent about different things and it 's very unlike the bullcrap which is possibly the most listened to source of music out there called rap . I usually listen to jazz , but I would rather prefer this over rap any day because you wo n't have to worry about hearing money , sex , drugs and b * tches all the time . Although , you may also find negativity in this kind of music .
 This album is by far one of the best I 've ever heard in my life . I am a huge SOAD fan , and their sophomore effort is definitely great . They debuted in 1998 with their Self Titled album , and 3 years later , the still unknown SOAD came out with Toxicity . It is sheer genius .1 . Prison Song - A strong opener that criticizes the prison system of the US . The opening guitar chords ar eunforgettable as Serj whispers , `` They 're tryin to build a prison . `` 2 . Needles - One of my all-time favorites . A cool intro leads to heavy basses , guitars , and drums . Very awesome .3 . Deer Dance - Intense intro that builds up to a sliding guitar with very fast drumming in the background . AWESOME .4 . Jet Pilot - Underrated brilliance . A Metaphor for jealousy . The songs begins so loud , it 'll knock you over . This leads to a quiter , sweet verese .5 . X - Short and sweet . Fast guiatr and drums in the beginning lead to a dominant verse . It 's fast and to the point , a favorite of any SOAD fan .6 . Chop Suey ! - the first single , and one of the best songs on the album . The start-stop action of the verses is unforgettable and the climax at the end with pianos in the background it godly .7 . Bounce - Funny song about an orgy . It might also be about how sex is becoming more of something one does with anyone -LRB- All players no names ... -RRB- Intense song , with a cool ending .8 . Forest - Great Song with a cool guitar riff playing over the verses . Then the crushing chrous roars in . Its simply awesome .9 . ATWA - Air Trees Water Animals . Soft intro that leads to a chrous that 's anything but . Its a roaring classic .10 . Science - awesome intro , verse , and chorus . Towards the end of the song , Arto comes in and plays some really cool stuff . Its a greatr song .11 . Shimmy - a classic made famous by Tony Hawk 's Pro Skater 4 . It features a sweet intro and fast paced verses and choruses .12 . Toxicity - My personal favorite . The cool intro leads up to the heavy chorus , and then dives back into the verses . The little guitar solo towards the end is godly .13 . Psycho - funny song about being on the road awhile . It has a vicious chorus and at the end , an awesome solo where Daron seems to make the guiatr `` cry `` 14 . Aerials - the 3rd single . a ballad-esque song that features a classic SOAD riff . It leads up to a vicious chorus at the end . -LRB- Hidden -RRB- Arto - An Armernian folk song usually played at funerals . Its pretty coolSo basically to warp this thang up I 'll say this : Go Out And Buy This Album Right Now ! Then get their 3rd album ...
 System of a Down is an all around awesome band ! They have talent that few metal bands of today can even come close to matching . From intense screaming moments to well-sung melodies , Serj 's voice kicks ass ! Guitar and drum work is awesome throughout ! Although some songs , such as Jet Piolet and Shimmy are a bit too weird for their own good , they make up for this minor flaw in every other way . Hits like Chop Suey ! , Toxicity , and Aerials are perfect for those who like the hardcore aspcet of SOAD . Other awesome songs include Needles , X , Psycho , and Forest -LRB- though I really liked every song on here -RRB- . Though they sometimes tend to write songs that support the democratic point of view , SOAD is a band that will hopefully be around for a long time , and will hopefully make a huge dent in the rap and pop bull-s ** t that has become way more popular . Overall , I give this 4.5 / 5 stars . Buy this album !!!
 this is an excellent record.highlights-needles
 This is possibly my favorite post 2000 band . I mean it is the best metal gets . Its political , hard and down right cool . John Dolmayan one of the coolest drummers makes me proud to be a drummer . Some of the songs were just funny little songs and some of them were angry rock and some of them were just memorable . but i still wish there was osme way to put it all together
 I own this album and have continually listened to it of about a year and a half , and to me it never dissapoints . At one time , I kept playing this album for a straight week to see if I would get bored , and I did n't . But that 's just me . I forgot to mention this album as one of the best albums in 2001 . Also check out Steal this Album and the STD -LRB- Self Titled Debut -RRB- of the band .
 I admit , this was my first System Of A Down CD . Sure , I had heard `` Spiders '' and `` Sugar '' kicking around on the radio the year before , but this is the CD that got me to realize the genuis of this band . Thrasing and brutal one moment than beautiful and genuine the next . Some people say SOAD 's songs are short , but that 's because they are to the point . Full out stompers like `` X '' and `` Bounce '' are plain fun . < ... > `` Ariels '' I still love because of the haunting aura about it while `` Chop Suey ! '' and `` Prison Song '' have to be some of the hardest hitting riffs I 've ever heard . Serj 's vocals are all over the place , screaming and sweltering while still being melodic and throught-provoking . Guitars and bass go full force , stop , and than go full force again . A second effort that improved on all the great things the first CD had . Other standouts include
 this album kick 's major ass so this is how i rate it1 . Prision Song
 Though Systems message at times may seem a little overhwleming , the general statement they are trying to make is that of awareness and not just trashing . If any of the people who have reviewed this album actually read the lyrics and used their brains to review what System i sactually trying say you would see that their message is intense and supportive of educating America to things that occur everyday . In general American 's are very ignorant to waht truly happens in our world , and quite frankly we have alot of room for improvement . Naturally this is an opinion and a feeling that is n't agreed upon by everyone.As for the drug comments , System of A Down puts down drug use constantly in their lyrics across all of their CD 's . Their message is political , and is spurred from their desire for the acceptance of the Armenian Genocide . If you understood this you would see where their anger for government is spurred from.But ignoring all that , System has some of the most heart pounding , intense driving riffs . Every song is a classic , and builds on the amazing foundation of their first album , and songs such as Johnny . System i sfresh trend setting and stands apart from the crowd . One listen and I was hooked . It does n't get better than this boys and girls . If you want an amazing CD with some deep lyrics and some of the most intense playing seen today , this is your best bet . For the true fan , check out their first CD self titled and Steal This Album ! . The Energy can be seen throughout all their music
 This album is one of the world 's best.Toxicity is just Spectacluar all the song 's are heavy metal gold . The only song that might not be great is Deer Dance but iam sure i will grow on it but other than that all song 's kick major ass . I do n't actually have the album yet but my birthday is next week and i keep buging everyone to get it for me . Iam just so jelous that my firend has it . Plus the bonus DVD kick 's ass with the live stuff and the Toxicity video -LRB- one of the best song 's -RRB- Here 's somthing to do.Play Psycho with full bass.So my conclusion is ... This cd KICKS MAjor ASSSO GET IT IF YOU DON `` T HAVE IT ALREADY
 I enjoy this band very much because they have great lyrics and awesome gituar and drum music . They also decided not to include profanity to make awesome music . I also like the different topics they cover including political views and just plain crazyness . The band integrates these views into catchy and memorizing songs . Hmmmmmm ...

 First off , I recommend this cd to anyone who likes modern rock . All the tracks are listenable , and I usually go through the cd nonstop . The only problem is that System of a Down is n't all that musical . They tune down their instruments down one step , then just hammer away with no effort . While I do appreciate this album , it does n't offer that much musical talent .
 Toxicity is just a great album , and SOAD is a great band . There are great moments on the album , and there are some parts that *** , but overall its a really good album . Song-by-song breakdown : Prison SOng
 When this record first came out I was worried it would be too commercial , but its not . Do n't listen to the hype . This album never gets old , no one else out there can do what `` System '' does . They are one of the most original bands , doing your own thing can be hard . With the radio full of bands that sound the same , SOAD is the one different band . Other than the radio over played `` Chop Suey ! '' the rest of the album is great . If I could give it a 4.5 it would .
 WHOOHOO ! Awesome cd!Awesome band too!Buy this cd today!I love this cd !
 When i first saw the music video of chop suey!on mtv i new system of a down was something special.Then after i saw that video i decided to buy toxicity.after i listened to the album system of a down was one of my favorite bands . their unlike any other band you 've heard ! do n't even think about passing buying this album it 's awesome !
 Unlike their dissapointing first album , `` Toxicity '' distinguishes System of a Down as both talented and crazy - in a good way . They keep a melodic rage throughout that by the end of the album leaves one breathless . Here is a song by song breakdown :1 -RRB- Prison Song - A humorous and to the point first track . Great beat . 9/102 -RRB- Needles - An average song that left me indifferent . 6/103 -RRB- Deer Dance - The first completely serious political track that is interesting throughout and makes headbangers out of us all . 8/104 -RRB- Jet Pilot - Another average song , seemed a little dull . 5/105 -RRB- X - A filler track that does n't distinguish itself . 5/106 -RRB- Choy Suey - Up to this point the album had two great songs , and then a bunch of average music that took up space . This song changed that - it is a classic song that got me back in gear . Truly emotional . 10/107 -RRB- Bounce - A good counter balance to the prior track that made things ligther . A good party rocker . 8/108 -RRB- Forest - A tad long and drawn out , but it has good parts . 7/109 -RRB- Atwa - A great intro followed by pure havoc . One of the best songs on the album that should have been a single . 10/1010 -RRB- Science - Kicks it up a notch from Atwa , and includes a great middle easter guitar rift near the middle . The only flaw is that it is a bit repetative at points . 9/1011 -RRB- Shimmy - This song seems to have no purpose or beat , and just gets skipped . 4/1012 -RRB- Toxicity - The best song on the album that is similar to Chop Suey in that it is both harmonic and full of rage at the same time . 10/1013 -RRB- Psycho - A good song that has an interesting hook , and good harmony near the middle . A good choice for a single . 9/1014 -RRB- Aerials - A great last track that is full of harmony . A great way to end an album . 10/10HT -RRB- Arto - No lyrics , but a good fade out track with middle eastern flavor . 7/10Although it had a bit too much filler at times , it rose above that because of its melodic rage .
 This CD really blew me away . I first heard Chop Suey and thought it was the best song in the world . I listened to it so often , that I eventually got sick of it and SOAD slipped from my mind . Then I heard Toxicity and loved that , and that one didnt wear out its welcome so I bought the cd and found out that the best songs were still yet to come : Prison Song - A Hard hitting song , with a death metal feel to it . A great one for sure . Some might not like it though , since its not like anything else.Needles - A great song about Drugs ... the bridge where Daron starts to sing is really well doneDeer Dance - Great song , very heavy until it gets to a great mellow bridge.Jet Pilot - Probably near the bottom of the cd in terms of greatness . But still listenableX - A very hard song , but its over before you can get into itChop Suey - A great song when I first heard it , but now I can still listen to it , but a lot of the other songs are better.Bouce - A funny song which I laugh when I listen to itForrest - Fantastic song , one of the bestATWA - Its about Charles Manson , but has an incredible opening , one of the best on the disc.Science - One of my favorites , I just love this songShimmy - Along with Jet Pilot , near the bottom but still good.Toxicity - In the top 3 of favorite songs on this albumPshyco - a great catchy song with a incredible guitar solo at the endAerials - The best song on the album , listen to this song and I ask anyone to not love it
 ... but this has n't come out of my player since I got it several days ago . I usually shy away from music lumped into the `` nu-metal '' catagory because it 's mostly a bunch of wannabees with little talent that rely too heavily on sheer aggression instead of cohesive , creative , intellegent music writing . Aggression is good , but in order to stand out , a band must learn how to use their brains and learn to lead , not follow . To be honest , SOAD are a rarity in today 's popular scene ; there are bands that come along , whom you can effortlessly pinpoint their influences and who they sound like , and then there are those who define a sound all their own like Tool , Korn , and Primus . With this album , SOAD have come close to establishing themselves as one of the latter bands , destined to have their sound regurgitated by many bands to follow.On first listen , every song was great . I would have trouble trying to pick `` the best of '' from Toxicity because EVERY song -LRB- except for maybe `` Toxicity '' -RRB- is unique , clever , and catchy . What makes this so good is the frontman Serj Tankian . WOW ! Kinda reminds me of Jello Biafra at times . He is so animated , lunging between enraged rants and heart wrenching emotion like a schizophrenic on speed . His vocal skills , and at times deranged sounding tangents , are top notch , while he also exhibits a wealth of maturity through his wider range of tones , the most prevalent of which is his increased usage of captivating drawn out emphatic harmonies . Beautiful harmonies -LRB- sharing the mic with guitarist Daron Malakian -RRB- one minute , death belching and screaming the next . One more area of praise is the lyrics . I wo n't go into detail , but they surely make for a good read . `` Toxicity '' is an album that draws from nearly everything , yet sounds directly like nothing . It 's one of those rare albums that injects excitement back into the scene , causing the listener to devour whatever comes next . The song writing is brilliant , the musicianship is precise and invigorating , and the depth of the material is utterly awe-inspiring .
 After owning SOAD album for the last year-two , I was excited about this new relaese , I did not really know what to expect , and I have to say I was pleasently surprised . With a one or two minor letdowns.Toxicity has the regular SOAD sound , meaning
 Non stop headbanging action . If you liked the first you will love this one , its actually a bit harder !! For the people who are buying this because of the Chop Suey you will be disappointed because that song is one of the few soft songs ...
 It is a rare occurence when I like a band 's second album better than their first . Most bands release a great first album and begin the burn out process . System of a Down avoided that burn out by taking years off between the release of their first and second album . The waiting paid off . This album is superb . System has transcended the genre of nu metal to create something unique and artistic . Along with their usual aggressive , pumped up music comes a new side of the band with a much more artistic side . They mellow out on a few songs , with great success . Most metal bands write softer music and the result is a boring ballad . With System , the softer songs are incredible , sounding like a different band than the high energy metal group that pumps out their other songs . If you want music that is creative and original , buy this album now .
 System , when I had first heard their debut in 99 , was one of the most promising debuts of the time . While coming in at a time where music was just begining to really come to a cliff -LRB- music hit the ground hard this year . So much crap these days -RRB- , System Of A Down created almost their own niche of metal . Sort of an odd-ball mix of a ton of genres with heavy overtones . Almost 4 years since their debut , they show no sign of softening anytime soon ... Luckly though , progression does show . Serj 's voice is used much more fully . Daron 's guitar is much more refined but just as wacky . Shavo still knocks out some great bass riffs . And John hits the skins as good as the debut.The evolution feels much more progressive than most albums . Still serving up the music that you loved from the first album , but with more refinement . Keyboards are added for good messure and some songs almost have a progressive edge to them . The songs themselves , once again stand out from each other . All with there own distinctive personality.But the question remains ; if you did n't like the first album , will I like this one ? My oppinion
 Seeing how it is my fav and i am a big heavy music fan ... This cd is one of the best out there and u recomed u buy it if u like heavy music ...
 System of a Down rocks . The music is incredibly original and perfect . The lyrics are powerful . I listen to this album more than twice a day . The more I listen to it , the more I enjoy it . My friends have all bought the album since hearing mine , and now they 're SOAD fanatics too .
 THIS ALBUM IS AN AMAZING EFFORT FROM SOAD . THEY MIX THRASH , PUNK , HARDCORE , JAZZ , AND MIDDLE EASTERN SOUNDS SO PERFECT ! EACH MEMBER OF THE BAND IS AMAZING AND HAS IMPROVED SO MUCH MORE .
 Loved this CD . I recommend Jet Pilot , ATWA but Toxicity is the best song I have heard in awhile . ALL of these songs are excellent !
 When I first got this cd , I was extremely enthusiastic . I have been a huge System fan for years , and this album has secured them as my favorite band in the world . Their constant flow from the crazy hard metal to soft beautiful mellow music suits any mood . This cd has beautiful songs . A rarity coming from metal musicians . Their Armenian background also has added a hint of Arabic flavor to the stew . Serj 's raw powerful voice coupled with Daron 's vibrato creates this mysterious sense of beauty that words can not describe . All I can say is that this is the best album I have ever purchased , and I have n't stopped listening to it once since I 've bought it . It makes other music look shallow and stupid . THIS ALBUM IS A MUST TO HAVE . Please buy it and enrich your life with groundbreaking music , and support this top notch band .
 This is one of the best albums ever created . If you are into heavy music and also like rock you will love it . It is hard to put SOAD into any category perhaps because they are a fresh stream themselves ... I would recommend it to all who appreciate novelty and alternative thought in music . The actual lyrics are not so important . This kind of music would be hard to digest for the shallow mind/taste though .
 How can you not like this band . Every song on the cd is good.Serj 's vocals are good whether he is going from loud to soft or high to low . This cd in my opinion was better than their last one but I loved their last one also . These guys may get criticized about their lyrics being mindless but you have to actually listen to the song to figure it out . SoaD has a great and promising future . Oh , and by the way if you like slipknot , mudvayne , linkn park , spineshank , or powerman 5000 , this cd should be # 1 on your list .
 Toxicity is the best cd . it has a mix of heavy meatal and alternate rock . The best songs are Chop suey ! , deer dance , toxicity , Forest , physco , needles and prison song . I recommend this cd to the people who like groups like rage against the machine or their 1st album `` system of a down ''
 These guys are from another planet ... crazy and brilliant at the same time ... Serj proves he can sing , scream , whisper , and croon with the best of them ... Daron comes off as a musical savant type who 's guitar lines are sometimes weird but make sense after a few listenings ... a lot of people i know blow these guy off because they 're too weird sounding and their music is just chaos . . well , it 's structure and brilliance from chaos on this album . -LRB- ... -RRB-
 This second album of SOD is really awesome . I got it a few days ago and i ca n't have enough of it . After the self titled debut , the band manages to bring on the goodies again , with a truly awesome masterpiece . Toxicity is great in all aspects , a perfect proof that the band has grown up alot since their debut.Serj has the same way of singing , so different and strange , yet so awesome , but his voice has progressed and now it sounds much better . Also all the songs are more complex , well written and different than those on the first album . There are so many time changes it 'll make you dizzy . One second it 's heavy and screaming , the other second ... back to a ballad . The lyrics are also better than on the first.The album starts with Prison Song , a great opener about the US prison system . Great song.Surprisingly , the next few songs do n't have the spark that characterizes the whole album . Well maybe except Jet Pilot . When i first listened to this album , after Prison Song , i was kind of disappointed , because Needles , Deer Dance , X , and even Jet Pilot , do n't have the originality of what i used to know about the band from their first CD.But i had no idea what was expecting me ... Starting with Chop Suey , it all changes . This is the SOD i love so much . Chop Suey is well known , there 's no point in describing it . And after the short Bounce , come the great songs of the album
 The second release from Armenian-American metal group System Of A Down , entitled `` Toxicity '' , is nothing short of incredible . It far surpassed my original idea on how the album would be . I heard most of the album before it had come out and it blew me away.This album is much better than their first album . Singer Serj Tankian demonstrates that he not only can scream but has incredible vocal ability , which , I feel , is most evident on their single `` Chop Suey ! '' Tankian 's distinctive vocals mix with the insanity of the guitar work of Daron Malakian , who also lends a hand on vocals on certain tracks . Setting the rhythm of the songs are bassist Shavo Odadjian and drummer John Dolmayan , who add a solid and consistant power to each song.There is no weak song on this album . Every song is good in its own way since each song is different from the other . Their lyrics are very diverse , ranging from the United States prison system -LRB- Prison Song -RRB- to sympathy for Charles Manson -LRB- ATWA -RRB- to pogosticks -LRB- Bounce -RRB- . As diverse as they may be , they are strong.I feel that the best tracks on the album are Prison Song , Deer Dance , Chop Suey , ATWA , Science , Shimmy , Toxicity and Psycho.If you like the music of the newer metal bands , then this is most definitely your best bet . One of the best releases of the summer of 2001 . If you are a fan of System of a Down and you do n't have this album , you must pick it up . If you just got into the band from the song `` Spiders '' and do n't like any of their other songs , you do n't know what you are missing .
 I 'm writing this review listing new Slayer album and i ca n't decide what is the best album of the year . I 've listen Toxicity so many time that i 'm addicted , and frusted because i ca n't understand how a man can write an album like this . No favorite songs , one of my favorite album of all time
 Thats all I can say about this cd . I have n't listened to metal for long but this band is easily the best I 've come across . I thought this cd would be like all the other metal cds I have . I was wrong . This cd has almost its own style of music . Also its songs have strange meaning I have n't heard from any other bands . From `` Prison Song '' 's hate of the U.S. prison system to `` Pyscho '' 's displaying the life of a cocaine addict .
 I gave this four stars instead of five bc the 6 song on this cd -LRB- chop suey -RRB- already skips . Other than that it 's fine ... but that was a bummer for sure .
 This is an awesome CD !!! I really love it ! But ... I wish Daron would sing in all of the songs . I really love it when Serj and Daron sing together like on Mesmerize and Hypnotize . Still ... I love this CD.WELCOME TO TOXICITY !!!
 Toxicity is SoaD 's best album including the songs `` Chop Suey '' `` Toxicity '' and `` Arials '' If you think thier newer albums are any good , you are wrong , -LRB- do n't get me wrong , i respect System of a Down more then i respect myself -RRB- Toxicity has more bass then all of there ather albums And the Guitarist -LRB- Daron Malakian -RRB- does a fantastic job . And besides This album has Serj Tankian On Vocals instead of Daron Malaian -LRB- Daron is good with guitars , but is not a very good singer -RRB- -LRB- Daron i still love you -RRB- But if you buy toxicty you will end up falling in love and will probably buy all of their cd 's ...
 System set the bar pretty high with their first self titled album . I never thought they would be able to top themselvs , but i was dead wrong . this album sounds alot cleaner then the last one , but it never loses its hard edge . Serj 's vocals r absolutle amazing , with great lyrics to boot . You can get in to every song be it fast like prison song , or slow like phsyco . all in all its so good
 People that wont like this CD without even listening to it properly are :1 -RRB- People Traped in the 70 's -LRB- I want more solo 's !!! -RRB- .2 -RRB- People who think someone who has darker skin then white is a terrorist . -LRB- Kill all Sand N % % g % S -RRB- 3 -RRB- People who love George Bush -LRB- What a ragga muffin he is i love that chap -RRB- .4 -RRB- People who dont know nothing about politics.This aint an AMAZING album but it is good . Reminds me of a heavy version of Mr Bungle , not as diverse though.It uses influences from varios different metal genres , so i wouldnt label it Nu-metal -LRB- Korn , Limp bizcuit talk about the same things and play similar music ? -RRB- Any way every one has an opinion i guess , but make it a bit valid .
 Toxicity is an excellent follow-up to their self titled album . With Serj 's vocals , Daron 's guitar , Shavo 's bass , and John 's drumming , SOAD is by far my favorite band ever . Serj 's voice control is absolutely incredible . He can sound like a ... . off grown man , but a second later , you could swear he is a little choir boy . He demonstrates this voice control in songs like Forest , or Psycho . SOAD is simply an amazing band . The current singles off of Toxicity are ATWA , and Chop Suey . They are currently working on a music video for ATWA to be directed by Shavo . I -LRB- and many others -RRB- expect to see very much more incredible music from this Lebbanese - American band . Way to go , SOAD !
 toxicity is SoaD 's best album lol all the song ar liek one song if you listne to them rite this album RULES lololol
 Okay ! Let us begin!Here 's what i think of the songs : Track 1 : Too political . -LRB- 4/10 -RRB- Track 2 : So-so .

 The two singles you 've probably heard are `` Chop Suey '' and `` Toxicity '' , both of which feature very original and surprising shifts in the speed and tone of the music , going from passionate rage to calm sweetness and back again . Be assured , these are not the only two songs like that on the album ; it is a CD that deliveres what it claims -- exciting and creative music .
 ... Now onto the review of this beautiful album.I loved this CD so much . I bought it one week after it came out in the brown packaging -LRB- ... known as the `` EDITED '' version -RRB- . In the lyric sheet there are no explicit words or on the CD there is no editing sounds . Was this PARENTAL ADVISORY in the first place ? I do n't know maybe I 'm just paranoid . I lost the CD to the brown case -LRB- I still have the case -RRB- and today I bought the red one with the PARENTAL ADVISORY marking on it , and yet no explicit words in the booklet or any explicit words in the music , it is the same as the brown version . I have not put in the CD-ROM yet which might be why the PA label is on the disc , possibly because of EXPLICIT LYRICS . I do not know as of yet . But anyway here is a list of my favorite songs on the CD :3
 This cd is the best i think its the best work from Serj and Daron . I 'll tell you what they mean the ones i think are coolPrison Song - means all the criminal life that has been misjudjing.Neddles - means hey guys stop being jerks.Deer Dance - means the disgrace that America has.That 's all
 I 've never heard any music from SOAD before `` Chop Suey ! '' and when I first heard it I shunned the band . I do n't know how I lived without the cd . I took a risk , bought it and found that it kicks ... ! I love it . ALL OF YOU NEED TO GO OUT THERE AND BUY THIS CD !
 This album is excellent -LRB- as you can probably tell from the title -RRB- with great musical performances and vocals from the band throughout . I 'm going to give a quick run-through of each song on the album : Prison Song - Starting with a stop-start riff & serj whispering before turning into a fast paced , political song and breaking down into a tranquil , melodic moment and back to fast paced riffing with daron and serj screaming on the chorus.Needles - Frenetic stop-start riffing with drums dominating on the verse and excellent drumming during the chorus from john dalmayan with serj & daron giving it their all on vocals during the chorus and melodic breakdownDeer Dance - Kick starts with a heavy riff before turning quieter with serj giving typically strange vocals during the verses and chorus before melodic vocals escalate to manic vocals and the fast paced , heavy chorus.Jet Pilot - Carries on the pace of ` Deer Dance ' at the start and during the chorus although has quieter verses with serj 's singing sounding very ethnic during these.X - Crazy , fast thrash riffs throughout this short song with serj singing very melodically in parts.Chop Suey - The first single has a very strong drum beat and bassline with guitar both thrashy & strange sounding at times and has typically excellent vocals with a sing along chorus.Bounce - The strangest song on the whole album featuring mostly thrash guitars and absolutely mad vocals from both serj and daronForest - My favourite song on the whole album , great vocals , probably the best chorus and vocals on the album and great playing of the instruments throughout . Too good to justify in words.ATWA - Inspired by Charles Manson this song starts with a very quiet guitar and soothing vocals with a heavier chorus and angry sounded vocals from serj and great back-up vocals from daron.Science - Starts with a riff reminicsent of old school metal before descending into thrash with shouty vocals from serj and a brilliant chorus with brief melodic respite featuring strange vocals and sounds and then back to thrash and the chorusShimmy - Brilliant , frantic , shouty vocals during this typically stop-start short song.Toxicity - The second single with absolutley amazing drumming fron john and whispery vocals in the verse and shouty vocals in the chorus , great song with the video directed by shavo odadjian.Pyscho - A song about groupies `` Pyshco , Groupie , Cocaine Crazy '' with a thrashy verse & tranquil chorus with great playing and vocals coming , rarely , entirely from serj . It also features a solo at the end reminiscent of ` Use Your Illusion ' era G 'N' R believe it or not.Aerials - Great closing song which although thrashy in parts is not as fast as the other songs and has an epic feel to it features melodic vocals coming almost jointly from serj & daron.Arto - Secret song following on straight after ` Aerials ' features strange tribal instruments and chanting .
 Even though SPIN and Rolling Stone are the two most incoherent pieces of garbage to be available on news stands , they at least know when to praise a great band -LRB- although rarely -RRB- . System of a Down 's Toxicity recently nabbed album of the year from almost every music publication out there.Not only is this album incredibly good , but it marks an advancement past the sound of their first album . While the sound on the first album was indeed just as amazing as this one , I found myself immediately drawn into this release . Daron Malakian definitely knows how to play a guitar , and has some great riffs that really make this album shine . It 's just all around heavy . John Dolmayan definitely has a bigger role with his drum work on this album , although he still ca n't compete with some of the more exciting drummers out there -LRB- read
 System of a Down has done it again ! This new album is fast , crazy , and sometimes its just funny to listen to their lyrics . I listen to this CD all the time , and anyone that likes any kind of rock will love this album . SO GO BUY IT !
 i heard chop suey and i loved it so much i went out and bought it the second the song ended on the radio.on my way out of the cd store i tripped over something and dropped the cd in a manhole.i went down to look 4 it and i found it.or at least half of it
 I do n't like Metal . Never did . I assumed System of a Down was Metal , because of what I 'd heard on the radio with Sugar , Spiders , and the newest release Chop Suey ! . Good thing I was mistaken.This album is far from metal . . it 's actually a brand of music I 've never heard before . They have a style all their own . With brilliant lyrics , and somewhat of a political stance , System of a Down smashed a Home Run with Toxicity . The album is incredible . There are a lot of catchy guitar riffs , and a lot of the songs chorus ' are equally as catchy . This CD wo n't leave my CD player for quite awhile .
 I can not believe just how good this cd is . It 's not like they just rehashed self entitled like some other bands follow up cds seem to do -LRB- Staind , Sevendust -RRB- , System grew , but did n't lose their roots . The opening 30 seconds of Prison Song I was Like ` Oh please do n't turn into start stop metal ' -LRB- The only problem I have with Mudvayne -RRB- . Then the song kicked in , and I thanked my lucky stars . The trademark of System to me was the oddness of what their songs almost always do , and the fact that no matter how heavy the song seems to be , there is always an underlying melody to it . There is an element of comedy to them , take prison song `` I buy my ... right here in Hollywood . '' But their music still holds its center . I would not recomend this to everyone , simply because of it 's oddness , but if you liked the first one then this will blow you away.I love all the songs but the standouts are `` Chop Suey ! '' which should 've been extended for another 3 minutes , `` Prison Song '' , `` atwa '' -LRB- which reminds me somewhat of spiders because of the end with the ascending guitar chords -RRB- , `` Ariels '' , and my favorite `` Forrest '' . Forrest is truly amazing , its heavy , but has melody , and the chorus and the end where the song speeds up is so cool -LRB- listen to it , you 'll know what I mean -RRB- . For your own sake buy this , to keep your sanity -LRB- or to Lose it -RRB- .
 system of a down is my favourite band and now toxicity is my favourite cd . i am not going to write a whole review of the cd cuz i dont know who would care to see other peoples opinions about cd 's and concerts and stuff like that . but the best songs on the cd are , deer dance , X -LRB- multiply -RRB- , ATWA -LRB- air , trees , wind , animals -RRB- , shimmy , aerials ahhh nevermind you get the point jsut go out and buy the cd .
 soo ... new SOAD cd ... its quite entertaining and stuff yet it 's odd ... but its all good ... better than the first ... worse than the 3rd ... soooPeace Out ...
 Im a punk rock fan with a distaste for ... - rock metal bands , and dumb rave pants wearing limp bizket fans . Usually i despise anything catogorized as metal , until i heard System of a Down 's new release . HOLY ... , this is great music . It is agressive , but not just screaming , its poignant , but not trying to be over-intellectual . I think that SOAD is much better than any `` metal '' band ive ever heard , and i throw them right in the mix with AFI and Cigar as hard rockin ' music that means something .
 i am in love with this cd . at the moment it is all i am listening to . diverse . melodic . ecclectic . intensely intelligent . i love every song on this . if i had to list my favorites ... wow . atwa . shimmy . aerials . those are favorites of the moment . i can honestly say that it has been years since i 've had a cd that i can stand to listen to from start to finish ... and love each song for it 's own reasons -LRB- instead of the fact that they all sound like the first single and are catchy ... so of course you like them for a week or two -RRB- each song is an entity . well , i 'm babbling here . great cd . great band . buy it . if you have their older cd and thought it was too dense or too striving to be serious ... this effort has shown that System Of A Down has grown as a band ... it makes an equal impact upon you ... with subtlety and melody . beautiful cd .
 This CD is beautiful . I can not begin to explain the greatness ofthis work of art that System of a Down has come with . With the masterpiece lyrics of Serij . Shavo 's breath taking bass riffs . The melodies of Daren 's guitars.The ear-shattering rythms of Jon 's drumming . This CD is a must have for any hard rock or punk fan . My favorite song so far is `` Deer Dance '' . I Highly suggest buying it if not for your own sake then for your ears sake .
 On renowned avant-garde metal maestros System of a Down &#65533; s sophomore effort , Toxicity , Metal and Melody are joined together in sonic matrimony . It is an astonishing mixture , and while it might be a little hard at first to swallow for the ears , it certainly pushes the envelope behind the mainstream conventions of modern metal . Rather than stick to the MTV-staple of rap-rock , Toxicity mixes an almost Mediterranean/Middle Eastern feel with pounding guitar riffs , by System &#65533; s producer and main songwriter Daron Malakian , on songs like the single , &#65533; Chop Suey ! &#65533; and &#65533; Science . &#65533; However , the melody is not only played , but also sung with great emphasis by vocalist virtuoso Serj Tankian , who has an explosively bombastic-like delivery . On songs like &#65533; ATWA &#65533; and the haunting album closer , &#65533; Aerials , &#65533; he demonstrates his talent not by his shouting , but showing to the world that he truly has the voice of a classic vocalist . His lyrics although not all the time coherent as in &#65533; Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot/One that smiled when he flew over the bay , &#65533; they do usually have a message behind them as in &#65533; Prison Song , &#65533; a revealing look on the Drug-War situation in our country today . &#65533; Beyond the Staples Center you can see America with it &#65533; s tired , poor , avenging disgrace/Peaceful loving youth against the brutality of plastic existence , &#65533; sings Tankian on &#65533; Deer Dance . &#65533; Lyrics such as these serve as a powerful reminder in the important issues that face our country today.Unlike their counterparts -LRB- Papa Roach , Slipknot -RRB- in contemporary music , they show a higher much level of musical maturity . Not merely whining about adolescent issues like Limp Bizkit , they know how to have fun and be creative at the same time . System of a Down was quoted in Rolling Stone that they want to see music evolve . The evolution has begun . Who will be brave enough as these audacious Armenians to take the next to step forward ? Only time will tell , and if these guys make the mainstream , you can bet that Backstreet and Britney &#65533; s time is almost over . So with that , get ready and make way for the evolution !
 Take Chop Suey ! -LRB- Track 6 -RRB- for example
 this is the best album by system of a down , definetly . i love them , and i love thier videos . this album has the singles such as chop suey , toxicity , and all the others i like , such as deer dance , science , aerials , prison song , atwa , and more .
 This CD is just beyond what you could imagine incorporated into a heavy metal cd . System of a Down not only has incredible points in their songs that show the many things wrong in the system we live by -LRB- hence their name -RRB- but the music is outstanding to back it up . Every song has its own special point and its own special moment in which it captures you .1 Prison Song
 Great Cd . The loudness of it all is splendid . Oh how nice .
 I think that this is the best System of a down Cd ever ! i think it is better than steal this album -LRB- steal this album is very good though -RRB- and the first cd . Every song on this album makes you just makes you want to go up to someone and hit them . Serj , Daron , Shavo , and john did a pretty good job on this one . I think that they are alot better with out alot of bad laungauge .1 . Prison Song - very good a great opening song 7/102 . Needles - This song is great it think this is one of my favorte songs 10/103 . Deer Dance - Awesome song 8/104 . Jet Polit - pretty good really nothing special here 6/105 . X - this songs ok but the guitar and bass in this song is very good sonds sorta like slayer 7/106 . Chop Suey ! this song is very very good 9/107 . Bounce - This song is ... , well lets just say its not my favorte but its ok i think there saying something about a pogo stick but sorta of funny 5/108 . This is probably my favort song on the cd 10/109 . ATWA - this song is ok i think that they are talking about the murder Charels Manson sorta weiod 5/1010 . Science - this sogs ok the guitar and bass solo is pretty good11 . Shimmy - this song is ok its the only song serj wrote b imself 5/1012 . Toxicity - this is very good 7/1013 . Physco - this is real good one of my favortes 9/1014 Areils - this song is the best one on the cd 11/10Over all id rate this cd 11/10
 i own the album and i have listened to it about 137.5 times sincethe release i wind my mum up with chop shewey
 Man , this CD is definantly one of my favorites . Honestly , how can someone not like it ? Heavy , fast , political rock that is as good or better than Rage Against the Machine.Prison Song - Wow , this is such a fast and heavy song , and with a strong political message . 9/10Needles - Very cool vocals on this one , with a super-cool bridge . 9/10Deer Dance - Yet another fast song , but with a slower bridge . It 's totally cool , with a good message for peace . 10/10Jet Pilot - A very hard rock song , with somewhat of a hidden message in there . Can you figure it out ? 9/10X - This song is my least favorite , but it 's still a pretty good song . Through this song , there is no song that is not super heavy and hard . 7/10Chop Suey ! - Awesome song , it 's really one of the best on the CD . If you have n't figured it out yet , it 's a first person narrative from Jesus . Very cool how they hide their meanings . 10/10Bounce - A pogo stick orgy is kinda a wierd thing to sing about , but its still a cool song . 8/10Forest - Another great song , a little similar to Chop Suey ! he lyrics on this one are really great . 9/10ATWA - My personal favorite , it 's supposed to have something to do with Charles Manson . ATWA stands for Animals Trees Water Air . I 'm not totally sure on this one about the meaning , but it 's very cool . It 's the slowest song on the CD , and it 's totally cool . 10/10Science - Another really cool political song , another of my favorites . 10/10Shimmy - It 's such a cool song , it 's unbelievable . The coolest song on the CD , definantly worth a 9/10Toxicity - Another incredible song , this one slower with a fast chorus . The video is awesome for this one too . 10/10Pyscho - Another fast and crazy song , not as good as most of the stuff . 8/10Aerials - A perfect end to a perfect CD , a great slower song , also a cool bonus track on the end .
 Toxicity , Toxicity ... Probably the greatest song in 2002 . To me nothing tops the first time hearing it , I was so puzzled at this band having only heard CHOP SUEY -LRB- which took almost 5 months of listening to on raido and tv to start liking -RRB- It was so different from anything i have ever heard . It had everything from a sweet ass guitar intro-verse to a hardcore chorus . Then my friend introduced me to the album and `` Prison Song '' which also was different but in a good way , I will never forget hearing Daron `` I smack by bitch right here , in hollywood '' it was almost comical in a way . Thats what pulled me in a combination of Darons guitar-Daron and Serj Vocals-Comical aspect of the songs . Will always be one of my fav . albums.Prison Song - Great song , my fav . is Darons stuffNeedles-Probably my second fav . song , agains Darons partForest - I love this song to death , took a couple of listenings , the middle part is amazingJet Pilot and X - two least favorites , just did not do nothing for me and I dont mind at all , still the album is flawlessChop Suey - song that started it all , took so long to decide that i actually enjoy it and its because of Daron and Serjs dueling vocalsForest-Great song but not sure of the meaningATWA - love this song , I always like the SOAD ballads and this one quickly hit me like a ton of bricksShimmy and Science - these songs are the bomb , short but a great songs especially on the guitarBounce-song is HilariousToxicity-my fav . of all songs , I was so obsessed with it . It was so perfectly arranged and is a short song . Video was awesome tooPhsycho - best thing about the song is the ending soloaerials - very catchy song until radio played it out , but the first time i heard this song I could not get it out of my mindGREAT album , Flawless , flawless , Pick it up if you have not heard it
 whats up with all the insulting with alternative metal bands today . sure maybe the fact that the life hating thing shouldnt be there because if i made anywhere near that amount of money then i would be really happy . but this band is great this album is there best so pick it up and youll like it i garuntee it .
 im going to review the songs on a scale of 1 to 10 -LSB- buy this album its theyre bestprison song 8/10needles -7 / 10deer dance-7 / 10jet piolt-8 / 10x-5 / 10chop suey-10 / 10bounce-8 / 10forest-9 / 10atwa-9 / 10science-7 / 10shimmy-8 / 10toxicity-10 / 10psycho-8 / 10Aerials-8 / 10toxicty is there bestoverall-8 / 10
 very interesting band-can be fast and intense , and also slow and moving . The most interesting part of the band is what Serj Tankian can do with his voice , and in songs like , `` Chop Suey , '' and `` Toxicity , '' you 'll see what I mean . Definitely has that middle eastern flavor to it , which makes this album so different and original and cool . All you people who have reviewed this , have no idea what ATWA is about , do you ? Well ever hear of a little serial killer named Charlie Manson ? ...
 Good effort , most issues coverd on here are political . So it would not be everybodies taste . Musically it goes in different directions of metal/alternative , it certainly isnt complex music but it is not dull either . Definatly worth checking out .
 of course like everyone else chop suey brought me in ... . Well , this is a pretty great band . I think that this is a band that just wants peace and not war . But I do n't know . I 'm probaly too young to get it . But thats probaly the case . This probaly is n't for everyone . But just try it cause you might just like it . I suggest this to heavy metal rock fans ! and I suggest that people maybe under 13 get their parents ok first . But this is a great band !
 First , I must say that I do n't buy many recent releases because most contemporary music out there just does n't interest me . This , however , caught my attention . Like most people , I was brought in by `` Chop Suey '' -LRB- who would give a song THAT title ? , I thought -RRB- . After listening to the entire album , I came to the conclusion that this is simply stunning . Nobody else that I know of has created anything like this . I love the quirky attack , the hard-as-nails rhythms , the unique vocals , and the thoughtful and inspiring lyrics . I do n't understand the reviews that deem this `` terrorist '' music ; I see it as the exact opposite
 first of all id like to say a big **** you to some of the below reviewers who gave this album under three stars because this is phenomenal music and should be heard by everybody , the guitarist daron malakian is the most original guitarist ive ever heard some of his guitar riffs have left me speechless if you play guitar and listen to this record properly then you should come to appreciate and understand what i am talking about , and also do not judge this cd on the first song , i mean i love it to death but the guitar is very simple and a tad repetative , i have over forty Cds by artists including deftones , mudvayne , korn , metallica , limp bizkit , slipknot , papa roach , metallica , marilyn manson and linkin park and i can say that these guys are by far the best , here is a quick rundown of the tracks on this exceptional record1.Prison Song :8 / 10 an excellent headbangers song , great lyrics2.Needles :9 / 10 lyrics arent great but the guitar and drums make up for it3.Deer Dance :10 / 10 i will always love this song extreamly heavy but emotional suprising bridge4.Jet Pilot :7 / 10 good song but a bit repetative and boring , the guitar riff towards the end is interesting though5.X -LRB- multiply -RRB- :5 / 10 many people i know like this song , but i personally dont like it and usually skip it6.Chop Suey :10 / 10 this song is what brought many people to like system , this song has the best example of heavy and soft music mixed into a song , great emotional ending7.Bounce :7 / 10 a bit to gimmicky for my liking but a great song non the less a great mosher song8.Forest :10 / 10 another exceptional song filled with emotion , the end will really get you pumped , more interesting guitar and drums for ya9.ATWA :10 / 10 stands for air trees water animals , many people dont like this song due to its fairly soft intro and verses but it really picks up for you people towards the end , love the guitar10.Science :10 / 10 great song listen to the words and love the guitar riff in the chorus11.Shimmy :8 / 10 another real mosher song , pretty good , can also be found in the playstation 2 game tony hawks pro skater 412 . toxicity :10 / 10 the drums in this song are absolutley ledgendary and the guitar is really creative nice song the instruments work really well together in this song a little suprise for you at the end ... 13 . Psyco :6 / 10 another gimmicy song a bit of a mosher this song is give a six due to the ok guitar solo at the end14.Aerials :9 / 10 their 3rd release excellent song , soft parts and hard parts this songs ending will also leave you pumpedalthough you may not share my opinion of this masterpeice at first i assure you it will grow and you and you will love it , especially if you are a musician yourself or like heavy music
 This Cd is the best.Im always listining 2 it . Im even listining to it right now ! You should get this cd . Even though they cuss , ur parents wont hear because the system is always screaming !
 Toxicity is in awsome cd . This is System of a Downs seacond cd out . it has awsome songs on it like toxicity , prison song , atwa And there hit single Chop suie.The guitar is so cool in their songs And serji 's voice is the best it has ever been . If you get one cd this year make sure it is System of a downs knew cd , tOXiCItY.Also cheack out there self titled cd . You will love it ... . Peace
 After hearing Chop Suey I had to get this cd . As soon as I heard the first song , Prison Song , I knew I would love this cd . -LRB- I could rant for hours and hours about the drug war and the current ridiculous drug policy but `` Prison Song '' pretty much sums it up -RRB- . Other very good songs are Forest , ATWA , Deer Dance , and Toxicity , but those are just my personal favorites-all the songs are good . There 's little filler on this cd , if any . System is kind of different and not everyone will like them , but people who decide to give them one star should at least have enough musical knoweledge and intelligence not to compare System and Drowning Pool . They have different styles , System 's being far superior , much more unique , interesting , and talented than Drowning Pool 's -LRB- who should be classified under unoriginal , untalented , headache-inducing , Korn clone * expletive * - -LRB- censored courtesy of Amazon.com -RRB- . This is completely random , but speaking of censoring is n't it great when Mtv shows some video that has fairly explicit and graphic scenes and then they go and beep out the `` s word '' . Well anyway , to sum up all the points in my random useless review I think the drug policy in the U.S. is idiotic , Drowning Pool sucks , I do n't like censorship , and the System cd is awesome and everyone should go buy it .
 System of a Down 's sophomore album is criticized as being a terrorist album because it came out on 9/11 ... and because the band members are from a middle eastern nation originally.I 'm not surprised , but dissappointed by these racist rants . For one , Armenia is near the middle east but is a Christian nation , not Islamic . For another , even if they were Islamic , it doesnt make them terrorist . What is a terrorist anyway ? Christian nations who take over entire nations , exploit resources , destroy cultures , enslave humans , and enforce Christianity ? The governments involvement in Iraq is a terrorist act in itself . The events of 9/11 have no connection with Iraq besides stupid Americans who group all of the Middle East and its inhabitants as one collective . There is no hope for this sad country which continues embracing racism even in music , the only thing good in this corrupt world .
 The price was right . Fast delivery . My sons like . Thanks . Colleen
 This was no joke the best album ever made by SOAD . Here 's the list of songs and my personal ratings.Prison Song - 8/10Needles - 10/10Deer Dance - 10/10Jet Pilot - 6/10X - 9/10Chop Suey - 10/10Bounce - 7/10Forest - 10/10Atwa - 8/10Science - 8/10Shimmy - 10/10Toxicity - 10/10Psycho - 10/10Aerials - 8/10The album is truly worth buying !
 this is the best cd by them and I hav all of the them it is my fav cd by them I love it of you like s.o.a.d buy it now
 This was the first cd I bought of system of a down before I ended up having the whole collection . The first song that I heard that got me into this band was Toxicity ! And all i can say is wowwww ! This is the type of cd that all you have to do is just put it in the cd player and not even touch anything , well , except putting the volume up ! For me , all the songs in this album are excellent , but i will give you my personal opinion on each one : Prison Song - Excellent Intro , great message and full of energy . Its pretty self explanatory as to what the song is about , just listen to it and you 'll see.Needles - Another great song that talks about heroin . Great drumline and beautiful riffs . I love the ending , evrytime i hear it , I can picture Serj doing a russian dance!Deer Dance - This is one of my favorites , talks about war and empires pushing the smaller countries around . My favorite part of the song is the break , when serj and daron sing together , `` Pushing little children , with their fully automatics , they like to push the weak around ! '' and then after that part , all hell breaks loose . . Jet Pilot - One of the weirdest songs in this album , to this day , i still dont know what the song is about . But its drumline is out of this world and has a middle eastern twist to it too . . X - This song is awsome , full of energy , talks about genocide , very sarcastic when Serj says , `` We dont need to multiply , Die ! '' John definitely earned his stripes with this track , He definitely knows how to make those drums smoke . . Chop Suey - My favorite song on this album , alot of people have different opinions about what the song is about , but for me , this song is about terrorism . Its a song thats filled with emotions , you can tell towards the ending when serj and daron sing the final chorus . It gives me goosebumps everytime i hear it . This song will go down as one of their classic ones.Bounce - One of the funniest songs on this cd , but with great aggresive drums and guitars . . Forest - This song is excellent , great rythym ... Its a very weird song , but im into weirdness , thats why i love it , Especially the beginning when Serj starts off , `` COme with me my little child-ahhhhh ! '' Awsomeeeeeeeeeee!ATWA - Stands for Air , Trees , Water , Animals . Talks about Charles Manson , oddly enough ! Its a great and beautiful song . I love it how it starts nice and slow and melodic , and then it just explodes in fury ! Also one of my SOAD favorites.Science - I love this song , I connect alot with this song cuz i feel the same way . Science has made our world turn into total crap . This song also has a middle eastern twang to it . Great vocals by Serj.Shimmy - Another funny song by the ever so sarcastic band . Short and sweet!Toxicity - Thanks to this song , I am a # 1 SOAD fan . This song was the gateway to owning system 's complete discography . The best song ever ! Cleverly put together with a powerful message about evil society and urban life . A true classic ! Psycho - This song is beautiful , packed with energy and strong vocals in the beggining . THe best part of the song is the guitar solo by the ever so great , `` Daron Malakian '' . You rock dude!Aerials - What better way to end the album , but with a masterpiece track . Excellent track , beautiful lyrics , astounding vocals by lead singer Serj Tankian . One of the most melodic songs in this album . And to top it off , they end it with a bonus track , with a middle eastern rythym to it . That track is commonly played during funeral ceremonies.So please , i will say no more . I hope that my review proved helpful and will make you run to the record store to get it . Enjoy !
 I love `` SOAD `` beacause there diffrent from all the other bands.and i would n't of never liked this band if it was n't for my freind who told me that `` SOAD '' stould for `` system of a down '' beacause when i sall it i culd of swore it stould for `` sheep on a dolphin '' and my mom sall it and she thought it stould for `` peanut butter '' long story short the whole album is awsomly cool exept for `` x '' wich is not a song about the 24th letter in the alphebet although it would sound beter than this `` X ''
 System of a Down 's Toxicity should be classified as a break-through catchy album . I got this in 2002 and I could not stop listening to it .
 This CD is cool . I like how they have such a variety of different songs and words . -LRB- themes -RRB- I really like it even though I was kind of late getting it .
 This is a truley amazing cd ! The style of Arabic type singing on nu metal is amazing , original and well-blended ! The powerful music delivers a great preformance-Prison Song - their trying to build a prison for you and me ! 5/5-Needles - cool 4/5-Deer Dance - alright 4/5-Jet Pilot - really cool 5/5-X - cool 4/5-Chop Suey ! - The best song ever ! 100/5-Bounce - real cool 5/5-Forest - cool song 5/5-Atwa - great !! 1000/5-Science - cool 5/5-Shimmy - real cool 5/5-Toxicity - sweet 100/5-Psycho - cool 4/5-Aerials - real cool-Arto - real cool tribal song 5/5
 A great fast , furious , bouncy cd . Heres a discription on each track .1 . PRISON SONG
 The first time I heard this CD at a friend 's house , I hated it . But after another listen or two , I ended up loving it . The lyrics are insightful and political , and are paired with driving , heavy riffs . The best songs are definitely Aerials , Chop Suey ! , Toxicity , Prison Song , Forest , Needles and Science . However , all of them are good and they are the type of songs that will get you pumped really easily . If you like hard rock , chances are you will like this album . -LRB- I have also heard Steal This Album , which has some of the unreleased material from the Toxicity recording session . It is very good too . -RRB-
 Holy -LSB- smokes -RSB- ... this is one of the best cd 's EVER !! the diversity and mixture of sounds throw you through a roller coaster rides of emotions and feelings , and you ca n't help but feel relaxed Aerials to finish you off . Here is a little song by song review : Prison Song
 To begin with , I LOVE this cd ; however , when I purchased ` Toxicity ' I was expecting all of the tunes to have the harmonies present in Chop Suey ! and -LRB- the song -RRB- Toxicicity . That was not the case . Not all of these tracks are quite as catchy -LRB- at first -RRB- as the songs getting radio play.With that said , this is an incredible cd ! It 'll definitely be on your list of cd 's that make you drive about 80 miles/hour on the highway without even noticing . This cd has some heavy material on it , great for unwinding after a long day . There 's some serious intensity on this disc that I ca n't describe in words . I picked up the disc after hearing Chop Suey ! and Toxicicty and it 's been in heavy rotation in the car ever since.If you 're looking for somthing heavy , pick this up . But just know that it 's not all `` Chop Suey ! '' and `` Aerials '' . If you 're going to purchase this cd , you might want to pick up one of the `` special '' discs . There 's one with a free DVD and another with a free CD-ROM , if you can still find them .
 System of a down is one of my all time favoritenew metal bands of this decade.I think this is thelandmark album for system , they really made it bigwith this one.Everysong on here is awesome.Somefans have different opinions on which one they likebetter Toxity or the first album , self titled.I loveboth of these albums and the new one Steal this album.However musically I think all their albums areamazing.Some fans think that the first one is heavieror toxity is heavier than the first one.PersonallySystem of a down is always heavy and hopefully theywill never sell out.My favorite songs on Toxity areArials , Toxity , Bounce , Prison song , Science , Psycho and wellbasically I love them all.I think Toxity is their bestalbum , even though I love the first one alot.The steal thisalbum is just as awesome as the other 2 . I ca n't wait fortheir next full length studio album .

 Very rarely especially in today 's music world can you call an album a masterpiece , but Toxicity , the latest album from System of a Down is definately worthy of that label . Mostley every song on the album is grounded in politics and the songs are fueled by the virtuosity of vocalist Serj Tankian , bassist Shavo Odadjian , drummer John Dolmayan , and musical genius/guitarist Daron Malakian , who is responsible for writing most of their songs . This album contains elements of many different genres of music , the most dominant is of course , metal . The album opens with Prison Song which is about the U.S. prison system , the song shows some of Serj 's vocal abilities , by going from a whisper to a scream in the matter of one line . That is like many songs on this album , he has the ability to completely change the sound of his voice and his singing style . Some more high points on the album include the songs Deer Dance , Needles , Bounce , and Forest which are all heavy upbeat songs with odd time changes and insane lyrics , to say the very least . I 'm sure most of you are familiar with the singles
 `` Father , into your hands / I commend my spirit / Why have you forsaken me ? '' - Chop Suey!You must hear this album for yourself to understand why it is dropping the jaws of critics and fans alike . Toxicity is 14 tracks -LRB- 15 if you count the beautiful Arto Tuncboyacian hidden outro -RRB- of pure ear candy.Serj Tankian . Daron Malakian . Shavo Odadjian . John Dolmayan . System of a Down is comprised of these four brilliant Californian Armenians . Their innovative style and powerful lyrics -LRB- no , Slipknot 's `` I want to slit your throat and f -- k the wound '' do n't cut it here -RRB- will leave you speechless . Only then will you understand why they are truly `` the most popular band that nobody has heard of . '' Do yourself a favor and buy this album . Sure , they made us wait for Toxicity , but boy was it ever worth it . In a sea of crap nu-metal bands , System of a Down emerges as the most original and rockin ' of them all.My copy of Toxicity has n't left my CD player ever since I got it . It 's that good .
 ` Toxicity ' , man , I just ca n't seem to make up my mind which is better , THIS or their self-titled album , they 're both SO good !!! Serj Tankian is an incredible vocalist and an intelligent , amazing person it 's no wonder he get 's along with so many people in the music industry . He 's a man who 's not afraid to say what 's on his mind in OR outside the the music he creates . Daron also brings out his superb guitar playing skills unbelievably well on this recording too , his solo 's are incredibly individual to anything else I 've ever heard before.Shavo , the best beard in the band ! And one hell of a bass player . John , the drummer , has too never sounded more energetic.This album goes straight up there with all the other metal classics ! ` Prison Song ' is my all round favourite track on the entire album ! It took me quite a while to pick a fave , but I got there in the end ! ` Bounce ' is just incredibly silly and funny , ` Science ' , ` Chop Suey ' -LRB- ANTHEM ! -RRB- , ` Deer Dance ' , ` Psycho ' , ` Shimmy ' , ` X ' & ` Ariels ' are all my other faves too.SOAD rule ! laters !
 I had already bought the other special edition cd that came with the cd rom disc and i loved it . When i saw this i had to buy it just for the bonus dvd . It was very worth it . Toxicity is a good video and the three live performances of prison song , chop suey ! and bounce are awesome . It is very worth the money to buy this cd . Even if you have the cd itself already , buy this version too .
 It 's hard to decide whether Toxicity or Steal This album are the better of SOAD albums , but I have to ere on the side of Toxicity . It is short and punchy , has some great riffs and some very intelligent lyrics . It is safe to say that every song kicks ass , and I 'm always feeling left slightly disappointed when the album finishes ! A great album and should be part of any metal/rock collection.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page .
 I do n't know if music can be addictive , but I ca n't stop listening to SOAD , especially this album . I only wish there were more recordings for System , that 's my only gripe . There are so few bands with such incredible originality , engaging lyrics and guitar and drums and YUMMMMMM . I can not believe how many times I 've put this on my MP3 , more than ANY other chunk of music , maybe EVER . Only Metallica and Queensryche have inspired me so much . LOVE you Serj and the rest of the brilliant musicians that form this ground shattering band ! Steal this Album is also AWESOME ! Maybe even more better....hee-hee !
 I bought this album not knowing what to expect and I 've got to say its FANTASTIC . If you are a SOAD fan this cd is the first one you should buy.Some of my favorites are Chop Suey , Toxicity , and Aerials .1 . Prison Song-A really good song . A great way to start the album . 9/102 . Needles-One of my favorites , really good . 9/103 . Deer Dance-One of the best . 10/104 . Jet Pilot-OK song . Gets a little repetative . 7/105 . X-Another OK song . 7/106 . Chop Suey-My second favorite song on the album . a really brilliant song . 10/107 . Bounce-Hillarious yet awesome . 10/108 . Forest-I love this song . Every time I listen to it , it makes me smile . 10/109 . ATWA-Really good song , I love Daron 's voice on this one . 9/1010 . Science-Pretty good and its got a catchy bridge . Spirit moves through all things . 8/1011 . Shimmy-Probably my least favorite on the album . 7/1012 . Toxicity-My favorite song on the album , hands down . 10/1013 . Psycho-Another really good song , and I love the guitar solo at the end . 10/1014 . Aerials-Different from all the other songs but in a good way . A great way to end a great album . 10/10
 Seriously , this is an incredible album and System of a Down are a truly unique band that have become the success that they are through creating music like nothing heard before . `` Nu-Metal '' is simply a genre label that was created in order to allow other bands with a `` unique '' sound to belong to . This is something that System of a Down created , they were a band that stripped away that label of being a rock band and essentially created a genre of their own . Serj Tankian the lead vocalist of the band is an incredible talent of massive proportion , he 's not only a songwriter but he 's a poet , a visionary and a political critic . He picks out parts of the System that are corrupt and downright criminal and gives us his no holds barred approach to the system . Along with being an utter genius at what he does , I think we can all agree that listening to how some of SOAD 's songs are constructed Serj Tankian is possibly a little bit insane -LRB- The good kind , not the OJ Simpson kind . -RRB- This album is considered by many to be the Systems best album to date and from turning on track 1 . Prison Song you come to realise how inventive , talented and intelligent this band really is . This first song simply points out the hypocrisy of the legal system when it comes to drugs , it points out the convenience of drugs being on our streets and less money being spent on treatment and more on prisons when research does show that treatment should receive the most money from the government . It 's a brilliant song that shows quite clearly the intelligence and political mind of the band . This is something that should be brought to the mainstream more often and it 's a shame that even now bands like this are looked down upon simply because of their sound.Honestly this is an amazing album and for those fans of music in general , who keep an open mind and are quite experimental in their tastes , then I promise you will be pleasantly surprised.My Top 5 ArePrison SongChop SueyXDeer DanceNeedles
 This is the first SOAD ablum I ever heard and the intensity of it can blow you away -LRB- edit
 My mind races at the thought of having to compare Toxicity with the first album . They are both amazing CDs that compliment each other so well thats why its such a mindf ** k to pick a favorite between the two . I can choose favorite tracks ; Shimmy and Needles . All I can say is that Toxicity is a better album to smoke pot to since I cant decide which album is better .
 In their second album , System of a Down delivers a hard hitting , completely original and influential masterpiece that is Toxicity . The 4 politically charged metal makers of this new style of metal have really hit the jackpot with this album . There is no mistaking it , this is a band that can only go farther and farther.First , the main reason why you should like this band is their individuality . Before this CD , I had never heard anything like it . Even how they present some of their politically charged songs like `` Prison Song '' and `` Deer Dance '' is just amazing because when you think of political metal , you think of Rage Against the Machine and I assure this is nothing like that at all . True , System of a Down is a band all their own . The second reason you should really be into these guys is because they give an unbelievable balance of melody and metal in their music that gives you a fast paced yet eloquent listening enjoyment.The 2 big songs off this album are `` Chop Suey ! '' , probably one of the weirdest singles on rock radio ever but still an amazing song . And the other would be the album title track `` Toxicity '' . A lot of people were extremely surprised that these guys got this much support on the radio with this song alone but I think it was for the best because as I remember 5 years ago , the metal on the radio -LRB- at least in Minneapolis -RRB- was Linkin Park , Saliva and Staind . It was nice to get a change from the ordinary.Personally , I could n't find a song on this album I did n't like because even the bizarre lyrical abstracts like `` Bounce '' and `` Psycho '' at least made me laugh . And then some of the B side songs on this album like `` Forest '' , `` Deer Dance '' and `` Needles '' are musical mastery . Seriously , just sampling these guys ' music is a great experience . This is totally worth it . Even if you 're not into abstract , artistic metal , this is still a great album . 5 star CD !!
 This CD is by far the best I have bought in quite some time . It has barely left my car CD player since I got it.I was never into System of a Down Before , but once I put this CD in I was hooked . Their style is like no other band . They are refreshingly one-of-a-kind . If you are sick of the mundane/overplayed , pop/alternative rock , buy this!Buy this CD . The more you listen , the more you will want to listen . You will find yourself singing the songs as soon as you wake up !
 First off , someone mentioned that this album 's melodies were in a weird Arabic style which he thought was a wrong orientation after 9.11 . -LSB- Stop -RSB- that thinking . I write Middle Eastern influenced riffs every now and then , but it does n't make it music that people might not want to hear . But anyways , while some people think the album 's not as good as the first , I think it might be a bit bette , not by much , but it 's a different album too . Different styles were used , and more speed and palm muting was used too . Who cares if it 's solo-less . Though Nirvana had some solos in their songs , how complex were their songs ? not very . How far and deep reaching was their music ? Very far and deep . It 's about the whole picture . If pentatonic solo -LSB- stuff -RSB- does n't fit in with the song , then toss the solo , not the song . I will definetely look forward to what they do next , especially with newer sounding songs like Needles , Chop Suey ! , ATWA , Toxicity and Aerials . Also , if you can find them , get the b-sides -LSB- ... -RSB- the system , Innervision , and Blue .
 SoaD has put out a very good disc with TOXICITY . It was probably one of the most anticipated metal releases this year and it doesnt disappoint . The album has some great melodies to go aling with some straight ahead in your face rock . -LRB- Chop Suey -RRB- It also has some pretty amusing lyrics -LRB- Needles -RRB- . DEER DANCE is also a great song on this disc . Some of the lyrics are serious and try to make the listener think . JET PILOT , BOUNCE , ATWA , FOREST , and AERIALS are also some of the stand outs here that you will want to listen to . Get this CD now
 I wo n't have much to say about this CD ... but I will say that this , this CD ... this is worth the money to buy ... and worth the time to listen to.System Of A Down has created a sound like no other band out there . They hit hard , and fast ... and with a little introspection and melody thrown in for good measure . While their peers like Slipknot and Mudvayne sing with just primal ferocity , SOAD has thrown in some political manifesto lyrics like Rage did ... with that said , Serj sings about the broadest of topics ... psycho groupies , pogo sticks , the state of the drug war , etc. , etc. ... now what other band can have a song about the corrupted prison system and drug war , and then turn around and do a song about a pogo stick the next ... only System Of A Down can . This my friends is an exciting album ... a maniac lyrical delievery ... a twinge of melody ... and a hard hitting edge ... what more can you ask from a Hard Rock band ... nothing ...
 System 's newest disc if so much more intelligent than anything I have heard in a long time . The music is so powerfull that you just would expect the lyrics to be the typical crap , more screaming and spitting . I used to listen to metal back in the day but then it just got stupid . People were just going for shock value than actual good music . This has the right combination of screaming and growling with unreal smart lyrics that will have you thinking about them for hours . Do your self a favor and buy this CD today then listen to it 10 times and read the lyrics in the notes . This is guarenteed to make you feel like you are a rock star or something .
 Finally modern rock has produced a band worthy to follow in the footsteps of The Who , The Clash , The Jam , and even the Dead Kennedy 's . I have heard a lot of hype about `` political bands '' for ages but System of a Down is the first one to combine honesty , politics , and good kick-a & & music in ages . Probably the last time this happened was when Joe Strummer of The Clash had to explain politics to drunken frat-boys -LRB- waiting for Van Halen presumably -RRB- at the US Festival in 1983 . `` Toxicity '' did n't come soon enough for me ! Now if only Philly could produce a group like this ; but that would probably take unrealistic divine intervention .
 Let me start off by saying that I did n't care for the last album.This one however is light years ahead of the debut . Sonically it is phenominal , they got great sounds this time out.The songs are heavier and less quirky than the debut . There are some awesome heavy riffs with great grooves , however there are still some of the annoying -LRB- IMO -RRB- vocal interludes . Basically I tolerate these to get to the cool parts , fortunately those `` coolparts '' pay off big . Just saw them for `` Pledge Of Allegiance `` and they were outstanding live .
 I must admit ; when I heard my first System song , it was `` Spiders '' from the Scream 3 soundtrack , and I loved it immediately . So being the influential young mind I am , I decided to check out the actual System of A Down cd . Not at all what I expected . My first impression was , `` Whoa ... lay off the speed , bro . '' I was taken back by the aggro-rock style these 4 guys emit , but after listening to the cd a few more times , I grew to appreciate it . Much like this time around with `` Toxicity '' . They still have the same in-your-face rock as the last cd , but the more I listen to Serj Tankian , the more I appreciate his musical stylings . The man has talent . Perhaps that is why he has his own cd 's and I just own them . Another reason I was surprised I liked these guys was the fact that they are an extremely political band . The `` Prison Song '' deals with -LRB- duh -RRB- the prison system in the U.S. I like it . I really do . As I 'm sitting here trying to come up with a reason why someone should buy this album , and also trying to compare this band to some other bands out there , I am finding it increasingly difficult . In the political genre of rock music , I can think of two other bands
 There is one thing wrong with this album and that is it made me like their s/t effort less . Although there is no ` Sugar ' on this album it is pure quality from start to finish . The only song i do n't love is Jet Pilot because I think its a bit too heavy in all the wrong ways but its still a good track . Best songs for me were Chop Suey , Forest and ATWA.I reckon Serj is the main reason that SOAD are a brilliant band rather than just a good band but every member pulls their weight . In short a modern day classic .
 I admit it . I 'm one of those pretentious music geeks who only listens to obscure stuff that only other pretentious music geeks have heard of and I only listen to new stuff in secret . Just kidding.I did buy this album because I heard `` Chop Suey ! '' a bunch of times on the radio and saw the kickass video on M2 . Having never been a huge fan of the first album , I was n't expecting a whole lot to sink my teeth into . Well , I 'm certainly the fool here because this sucker is badass from start to finsish . Starting with `` Prison Song '' and ending with `` Aerials '' , Toxicity grabs the listener around the throat and flings you around like a rag doll for nearly an hour . While the album 's greatness came as no suprise to the fans , this was my shock of the year . I had no idea it would be so good . If I could only come up with two words to describe this album it would be `` sheer energy '' . I guess one reason I like it so much is that they kinda remind me of some of the harder stuff that Faith No More -LRB- one of my all time favorite bands -RRB- did back when they were still Faith No More . I only say this because of the band 's eccentricties and Serj Tankian 's ability to change his voice . His random vocal switches remind me of Mike Patton , both with Faith No More and Mr. Bungle . I love how they can switch from being dead serious while throwing in a little saracasm and still sound heartfelt . How many bands can seethe with rage on one song , then turn around and do a song about a pogo-stick , all on the same album ? I liked Toxicity so much , I bought it twice -LRB- I never do that -RRB- . I 'll be catching these guys next month when they hit St. Louis , on the Pledge of Allegience Tour . It does n't really matter where your musical taste runs . It may be a bit off beat for some people , but I 'm sure that many will find something to like here . God , I sure did . I feel like such an idiot for not giving these guys a chance earlier , when I should 've . Anyone who really digs this album might also want to look into Mr. Bungle or Faith No More 's `` Angel Dust '' and `` King for a Day , Fool for a Lifetime '' .
 This is simply an incredible album . The songs have a stunning mix of a super heavy sound coupled with very melodic sound . I encourage anyone who has any interest in metal to get this album !
 This CD is one of the best CDs I have ever listened to . The music on this CD is very fast-paced and just plain crazy . I love that ! The best songs on this CD are
 It may have taken them 4 years , but System of a Down have returned with a very worthy follow up . `` Toxicity '' is much more mature and heavier than their debut . Some songs -LRB- i.e. `` Prison Song '' -RRB- have bobbing riffs , some songs -LRB- i.e. `` Deer Dance '' -RRB- have machine gun riffs , other songs -LRB- i.e. `` Jet Pilot '' -RRB- have guitar work that is very fast throughout , there are still more songs -LRB- i.e. `` Chop Suey '' -RRB- that begin slowly and build to a faster pace . But this is n't a complete guitar maelstrom . The drums -LRB- which often hit simultaneously with the guitars -RRB- are also very good -LRB- the title track has the best drum work -RRB- . Frontman Serj Tankien 's often soulful vocals and lyrics help make this album heavy in both meanings of the word . Some people hate SOAD simply because their a political band . That 's too bad , and it 's their loss . Some songs -LRB- i.e. `` Prison Song '' -RRB- have lyrical content that does deal with politics and politically related issues -LRB- `` Jet Pilot '' is about war , and `` Deer Dance '' is about police brutality . -RRB- But , for the most part , this is a `` socially aware '' band , not a political one . -LRB- Elsewhere , there are lyrics about over population , drugies , groupies , science `` failing mother earth , '' religion/spirituality , pollution , and suicide . -RRB- Sure , there are some songs -LRB- `` Bounce '' -RRB- that were made just to get mosh pits swirling , but this is a very deep and thought provoking album and there are many lessons to be learned from the lyrics . If you learn nothing else from this review , know that this album is a masterpiece .
 I do n't listen to much rock lately because I 'm a fossil -LRB- Jimmy Page is a god to me -RRB- but I did like this album . It 's different enough from all the other cookie-cutter mass consumption music that has been produced lately - any comments Himo ?

 Toxicity ... Perfectly packaged testosterone of intelligent design . Have another Red-Bull & Vodka and blast off - This is definitely one for the boys . Melodies and chords are tightly compressed into sounds that transport . Take the best of Candle Box , Tool , Metallica , throw in some hard Pearl Jam , well timed primordal screams and whispers , add whimsical nursery ryhme lyrics and you 've got it . This album is destined as a hard edged neo-classic !
 This is not as good as System 's other two CDs , but its decent . The version of this that comes with a DVD is great . It has three live performances and a the music video for `` Toxicity '' . The songs on this CD are very heavy , but they still just do n't sound as good as the songs on their self-titled debut . `` Prison Song '' is a kick ass opener with great vocals and a nice opening riff . `` Needles '' is a goofy song about ... tape worms ? `` ATWA '' is a song about the mind of serial killer Charles Manson . As you can see , most of the songs on this CD either have no topic , or a strange topic . Most of SOAD 's songs are like that . Their 's nothing wrong with it , it just gets boring sometimes when a band you listen to a lot sings about ... well , basically nothing important . These guys definetely have talent . The limited edition version that comes with a DVD is out of print , so if you have n't bought this yet , you 'll have to buy a copy of the original version . It is n't as good as SOAD 's other two releases , but its still a must own for any System of A Down fan .
 Dont listen to any of the idiots above me.this album is my favourite in the world.Buy it . it is worth ten times wht they charge . .
 Upon hearing the song Toxicity on MTV I had absolutely no hesitation in buying this album knowing that it would contain at least one gem . What I did n't expect was such consistency.Initially tracks like X and Forest do not stand out as much as MTV hits Chop Suey ! and Toxicity , however on further listens you will discover that it is the lesser known tracks that hold your interest and ensure this album stays in your cd player for a while . I now hope to see these guys live at some stage to see if the energy displayed on this album translates as well in live performance .
 The other day I was riding home from a barbershop in my friend Ryan 's car , just laying back in the passenger 's seat , listening to the loud , obnoxious radio . It was tuned to the modern rock station , and of course mostly what they play is Nu-metal and Post-Grunge . My ears soon tired of it . Yes , a lot of metal is good , but most of it is repetitive , unoriginal garbage and even good hard rock or metal bands can get boring after hours upon hours of distorted guitars , droning vocals and adolescent lyrics . I entertained the thought of changing the station , but of course I knew that there was nothing better on . What would I turn it to ? All the other radio stations only play Good Charlotte and the like . -LRB- You wan na talk about adolescent lyrics ... -RRB- But then , a miracle happened that made me sigh with relief . The title track off of System of Down 's second album , `` Toxicity '' came on . Having recently purchased this fantastic album and listened to it all the way through , from the opening track , `` Prison Song '' , it became clear to me that this Armenian-American , politically conscious alt-metal band has more gray matter in one of songs than in the rest of the Ozzfest bands combined . Their pointed tracts and metaphysical monologues convey a complex worldview , as singer Serj Tankian , with his long philosopher 's beard , seems to be an oddball , but in a good way.System 's songs live or die on the strength of his performance poems or , more specifically , on the slogan at the center of the chorus . He 's been known to bark such quirky mantras as `` They 're trying to build a prison for you and me to live in ! '' or `` Spirit moves through all things ! Science has failed our mother earth ! '' Their musical strategy is consistent and biting
 First of all , I do n't know why anybody that likes System of a Down would not own this CD . Some fans argue that this is not as good as their self-titled debut album , but I have to disagree . Every single song on here is good , and most of the songs are downright excellent . This is a CD that you can listen to all of the way through . Here is my breakdown of the songs :1 . Pison Song -LRB- Very Good -RRB- - One of the three songs on the CD where you can actually figure out the messsage of the song . Plus , the opening few seconds are truely excellent .2 . Needles -LRB- Good -RRB- - A song that gets kind of old after a while . However the middle part of the song deviates from the main theme and is very good .3 . Deer Dance -LRB- Very Good -RRB- - Another song with a political message . Fast paced and full of energy .4 . Jet Pilot -LRB- Average -RRB- - A short song that would be very good if the band expanded on it .5 . X -LRB- Average -RRB- - My least favorite song on the CD . The rythem is never very steady and the song is not very melodic .6 . Chop Suey ! -LRB- Excellent -RRB- - Even though it was played on the radio a lot , it still remains one of the best songs ever written by SOAD .7 . Bounce -LRB- Good -RRB- - A very funny song . It sounds like something that the band had played as a joke once and decided to clean it up and put it on a CD .8 . Forest -LRB- Excellent -RRB- - The song is a very energy-filled , driven song that has a very melodic chorus .9 . ATWA -LRB- Excellent -RRB- - A song that grows in intensity as it goes on . One of the best on the CD .10 . Science -LRB- Excellent -RRB- - The last song with a political message . The song rocks the entire way through and never slows down .11 . Shimmy -LRB- Good -RRB- - Not very melodic , but sort of similar to their sound on their last album .12 . Toxicity -LRB- Excellent -RRB- - You 've heard it on the radio . You know what I 'm talking about .13 . Psycho -LRB- Excellent -RRB- - A lyrically short song with a long -LRB- for SOAD -RRB- instrumental at the end .14 . Aerials -LRB- Best song on the CD -RRB- - SOAD saved their best for last . A great song to sing along to in your car and a great melody and rythem . Plus , it has an awesome bonus track at the end -LRB- think tribal . -RRB- The bottom line is , anybody that likes hard rock should but this CD .
 System Of A Down is one of those bands I have always been fascinated with . They just got everything ! And they always leave you longing for more with each listen . To call System Nu-metal is childish like Deftones and Incubus they are a band that is n't in the genre they pioneer and define the genre and make it hard for any band in the genre to look any good or not look like they are trying too hard . It kicks of to an abrupt start with `` Prison Song '' and the rush does n't end until about track nine where the ode to Charles Manson ballad `` ATWA '' kicks in where you can finally take a breath . Yes , sure the band is heavy but that does n't stop them from churning out some of the most beautiful harmonies and heartfelt lyrics of any of today 's bands . There is n't one bad song on this whole album and you never get tired of it with as many listens as possible . This album is timeless so please purchase it and do n't burn it trust it will be in your collection for a very long time .
 I am not a fan of the nu-metal scene , but I just had to get this album . My favorite songs on this album are Prison Song , X , Chop Suey ! , Forest , the title track , and Ariels . If you are not a fan of the nu-metal scene but would like at least one nu-metal album , let this be the one . Then again , this may not be for you.First half
 System Of A Down continues to deliver hard-hitting , meaningful metal music . This CD is my personal favorite of theirs .1 . Prison Song -LRB- 9/10 -RRB- A great opening song . Very striking polital views are present amungst hard-hitting music .2 . Needles -LRB- 8/10 -RRB- Awesome song with both hard and soft portions . Great vocals , too .3 . Deer Dance -LRB- 9/10 -RRB- Very meaningful and chilling lyrics mixed in with the usual great background music .4 . Jet Pilot -LRB- 8/10 -RRB- Lots of energy in this song . I also like the transition of vocal styles present .5 . X -LRB- 9/10 -RRB- I like the instrumentals in this song the most out of any other . Very energy-filled vocals , too . I love the growls .6 . Chop Suey ! -LRB- 10/10 -RRB- This is my favorite song . Not only S.O.A.D. , this is my favorite song out of any song I have ever heard . I absolutley love the transitions from quick-talking loud vocals to a melodic , well-sung chorus . The guitars are awesome , and the vocals are better .7 . Bounce -LRB- 9/10 -RRB- Great guitar work and humerous lyrics .8 . Forest -LRB- 9/10 -RRB- I like the vocals in this song a lot , both stylistically , and in regards to the message presented . The guitar is great , too , just like all the other songs on this CD ! 9 . Atwa -LRB- 10/10 -RRB- This is my second-favorite S.O.A.D. song behind Chop Suey ! The vocals are awesome . It is nice and soft with still the touch of heavy-hitting instrumental work .10 . Science -LRB- 8/10 -RRB- Good song , a bit repetative near the end .11 . Shimmy -LRB- 8/10 -RRB- Another good song . A couple cool growls .12 . Toxicity -LRB- 10/10 -RRB- One of S.O.A.D. 's best . The title track of the CD , and well-deserved .13 . Psycho -LRB- 9/10 -RRB- Very cool , effective repeats .14 . Aerials -LRB- 10/10 -RRB- Another one of S.O.A.D. 's best . They combine their usual hard-hitting instrumental style with melodic vocals . It has a good message , as well . Very reminiscent of Atwa .
 I loved this CD from day one and listened to it for hours daily for about 6 months . Every song is worth listening to , and there is a great variety . System 's lyrics are smart and political , far from N&uuml; Metal . THIS IS NOT N&uuml; METAL ! Following are song-by-song reviews . Every song is a minute or two too short for my taste , but it 's great .1 . `` Prison Song ''
 toxicity is a pretty good album , its alot better than their first album that cam out . My favorite songs from this album are
 WOW ! Do these guys play all their instruments with sledgehammers ? Super-percussive , attention getting loudness supreme ! SOAD gives new meaning to the words ` rhythm guitar . ` The first time my girlfriend played it -LRB- way too loud -RRB- I thought I would be annoyed . But my head was a-bang long before Chop Suey or Toxicity or any of the more popular tunes.It 's nice to see these local guys make good.Rock-us , dudes !
 I love this album , it has to be one of my favorite albums in my collection . Any time i hear toxicity or Chop Suey on the radio its stuck in my head all day . Any of the songs for that matter . If you love their first album you will love this one for sure . Be sure to check out Steal this album out too .
 With toxicity , system of a down has really progressed their sound . Better than their first cd , almost as good as Steal this album , But hey i am not complaining , i absolutely love this cd . Not quite a perfected like on steal this album though , ... if a was that crazy . JUST GO BUY IT , YOU WONT REGRET IT AT ALL .
 this is all i 've ever heard from this band . very fast , very complex , very heavy , and the vocal style is a great departure from the norm . only 4 stars bcuz its not incredibly deep and mind twisting , and its incredibly hard to play along w / the bass lines , but , for a nice rugburn on the old eardrums , pick this one up and u 'll be singen along with SOAD in no time
 Great screaming vocals , every one in this band is very talented , especially their drummer , very aggressive . A great hardcore cd that wo n't leave your cd till they make a new album . A masterpiece . Energetic
 How Steve-o can compare this album to anything Metallica and Anthrax did is beyond me . The Sepultura comparison is hilarious as well.Anyways , this is a great album if you 're looking for something different and are tired of the whole hip hop frat rock scene . From the message in Deer Dance and the ferocity of Jet Pilot , to the elegance of Chop Suey , Serj and company put together something original and fresh.Small minds need not apply .
 I love every bone-crunching , headbanging moment of Toxicity ! The thing about System of a Down is that they are not like any other hard rock band around . They know that in order for their heavyness to be effective , they must be softer at times . They seem to understand that intensity is nothing without buildup . If the whole album were nonstop pounding and screaming , it would get rather boring , but System knows how to mix it up with time changes , rifts , bridges , and solos . Every song is diverse and never boring . I must admit I doubted that these guys would pull off an album as masterful as their first ... but they have . You can hear the album begin to mature around track 6 , their first single Chop Suey ! . From that point on the songs take a shift from pounding to more melodic ... granted , melodic for these guys is still preddy darn hardcore , but you ca n't say it 's all just noise . System of the Down in my opinion is the resurrection of a breed we thought extinct before
 Great album . Love the unique sound this band has.I would recommend it . Amazon makes it easy to find music .
 Great band , all their music rocks ! I ca n't say anything bad about it except for if you were to listen to it 100 times , you 'd want to change it after a while ! Good music though !
 I really enjoy listening to this CD and no matter how many times I hear it , it never gets old ! But I still do n't fully understand how to load it onto cloud player so I can listen from my phone .
 It was great ! I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this ! This is one of my favourite albums by system of a down , and now I finally have it !
 I 'm not much of a `` hard rock '' fan . I enjoy it from time to time , but I mainly listen to Radiohead , older hip-hop , etc. . But this album got me hooked.One day , many years after the release of Toxicity , I decided to check it out . Right after the first track , `` Prison Song '' , I knew this was going to be a great album . The great riffs and political lyrics basically told me I was in for a treat . And I sure as hell was . Serj Tankian 's interesting -LSB- but awesome -RSB- vocals and catchy guitars and drum beats make for an awesome listen . Check it out.-Jeff
 This is the first system of a Down album I have heard and I must say it is one of my favorites . All the songs have words that actually go together thay say SOMETHING as opposed to bands like Blink 182 -LRB- everytime i look for you is a perfect example -RRB- . Aside from the lyirs -LRB- which I say can be very depressing -RRB- , the style of music is awesome and the voice of the lead singer is extremely unique . Ca n't wait for their next album , but if you 're wondering what to add to your CD case next , Toxicity is a very safe bet .
 This cd is the best I have heard since the original system of a down cd . I am a huge fan of these guys and I wish tha this cd was longer . I wish it was three four days worth of system music . They have progressed ALOT since self-title . They hav n't changed though . The lyrics are amazing -LRB- as usual -RRB- Serj sings them beautifully . Darron has come up with some amazing riffs . John and SHavo -LRB- though the do n't garner much credit as far as song credential -RRB- are better than ever . Possible the best songs are well , all of them . The ones that stand out though are ATWA , Aerials , X , Prison Song , Chop SUey , Forest , Shimmy and Arto -LRB- it i actually a bonus a little while after Aerials . Never mind ALL the songs stand out . I know that may not be helpful but If you liked self-titled you 'll die for this one . If you do n't buy it I PITY YOU AND YOUR LACK OF CHOICE IN GOOD MUSIC . -LRB- sorry if offensive -RRB- BUT BUY IT NOW !!!!!! . Thank you for your time . And always remember SCience has failed our mother earth .
 I happened upon this album because I heard `` Sugar '' -LRB- or whatever that song is called -RRB- played on KROQ and my musical tastes changed forever . The album is a revolutionary breakthrough in musical expression , combining the experimentation of greats like Frank Zappa with the melodic ability of Nat King Cole . The mind-force that created this music -LRB- the collective apparatus that is the intellectual force behind System -RRB- is absolute genius . Every grunt , note , sound effect and scream is perfectly woven into the fabric that assaults the ears.I have friends who hate this album as they can not get past the staccato resonance of some of the more popular songs , but in my humble opinion , these only add to the total experience that is Toxicity . This may well be System 's masterpiece - although we can hope they find ways to outdo themselves in the future . The Bonus DVD was a nice surprise and at the time of my purchase it was available at the same price .
 Dude , this album freakin rocks ! Oh , wow , I ca n't belive how good this band is ! I got this CD , because one of my friends bought it but then did n't want it so he sold it to me for $ 10 about a month ago , and I 've been listening to it ever since!This band 's music is very fast , harcore , and talented , their lyrics are so intelligent -LRB- how does Serj have such a large vocabulary ? -RRB- Serj , the singer , is great , I love the way he screams his heart out , and then sings in tune with the rest of the band ! Daron , the guitar player could really rock hard on his guitar , and he has some awesome guitar riffs ! John , the drummer , kicks ass , he pounds his heart out on those drums , and does some excellent solos ! Shavo , the bass player , is sweet , he really thumps hard on that bass , if you listen to this on a stero , turn that subwoofer on!Here 's how I rate each song : Prison Song
 Before I actually bought this CD , I heard Chop Suei on the radio a few times . Thought it was purely crazy . Yet , I was drawn to it . The same for the whole CD
 I 'm obviously going to give SOAD a five star review or whatever because they are one of my favourite bands . So I 'm surfing through the reviews when I find some 1 star reviews that trash this album to bits and pieces and then decided to be all triumphante and `` helpful '' by giving listing some `` worthier '' bands . who are they to imply that only the bands and artists they like are the right kind of music ? They do n't have the right . Music is something very valuable that connects with people and even if a song only connects with 1 person that makes it special and does n't deserve to be critized . What some people do n't realize is that music is taste . Certain people like certain music . Everyone 's taste in music is different and should be respected . I mean would n't you be pissed if someone said really awful about your music ? Anyways , its good to have opinions but being overly judgement and mean is a different thing . If u buy an album and do n't like it then I do n't see the point in reviewing it if you 're not an eudcated expert , and if you are one then why the heck are you posting reviews on this site ?
 This guy KarlMarxEmilioZapata seriuosly have a problem with SOAD . Here 's a guy who let his friends manupilate his thinking . He ca n't seem to make up his mind without getting opinions from others.I read a review by him in one of the Rage Againts the Machine pages , and in it too , instead of saying much about rage , he has gone on whining about how bad soad is.Seriouly dude , if you do n't like soad that 's your problem . . But remember that there 's million of others who do all over the world . -LRB- I 'm from Sri Lanka , even know where it 's @ ? -RRB- So please stop your f ***** g whining ... !!!!! No matter what you say , you 'll never be able to convince a true SOAD fan to think otherwise . Because they can makeup their own minds unlike you .
 I remember listening to Sugar of their first album about 3 or 4 years ago in my friends car , and while that song was so very very hard , it was definitely melodic in the strangest way , I was hooked on SOAD . I let them slip of my music radar , until this album kind of exploded onto it . They 're as hard as they ever were , but their melodies have moved to the forefront , and they 're so much better for it . I love this album , its musically complex and just a little off . That little offness is what makes them so popular , they are unimitable . The combination of the theatric vocals of Serj and the rabid instrumentation of Odadjian and Malakian is kind of without peer in the metal community , oh I forgot the drumming of Dolmayan , quite excellent to say the least . The highlights are Aerials , Toxicity , and the fine Prison Song , even if it is a little too political for me , I still love it . And of course the people who knew of them before Toxicity are going to cry foul and say they sold out to radio . But no one else sounds like them , so they are completely wrong . I 'm a little late on this one , oh well .
 What a great CD ! Lem me give you a run down of the CD1 . Prison SONG
 Toxicity is a very cool album , while it is very loud and intense at some parts it 's also very quiet and relaxing at others which make it really special . Lots of metal bands out there today just make noise and scream but `` Toxicity '' is n't like that by any means , it 's very musical . I suggest it for anyone who likes hard rock/metal , because although people who do n't like metal would enjoy some songs other songs would be a bit much.Higlights : Prison SongChop Suey!ATWAShimmyToxicityAerials
 im a huge fan of music like this . its kinda like fear factory only a little better . but i cant compare then like that . first of all , i like the guys voice ... the way he says the world Brutality or other words with Br words with R period . the way he announciate < -- -LSB- dont know if thats the right spelling -RSB- words anyways its one of the best music out there . of cource if you can handle the kind of music where the guy screams and so forth so on . the music got great bass , and I like Bass all the way . great CD i recomend it if you like heavy rock music .
 This is the best CD I have . . I listen to it at least twice a day , front to back . You never get sick of the songs ... Serj and the other guys in the band are really saying something in the songs , not just useless cursing like some other hard rock/metal bands !! yay i love this CD !!
 System Of A Down is a band that hates to have labels pinned on them , and this band has had their share of labels thrown at them , more labels than one would find in a supermarket . Whether they 're being called `` nu-metal , '' `` political rock , '' or even `` Armenian Rock '' is completely irrelevant . What is relevant , however is that System Of A Down is probably one of the few important bands to come out of the late-1990 's . SOAD is a band that I got into a little late in the game . I had liked them earlier , based on their hits `` Sugar '' and `` Spiders , '' but I did n't buy their first record until right before this one came out , and I did n't get this one until recently , for I had liked their first tremendously , but my record collection is usually a little short on heavy music these days , save for Helmet and Alice In Chains . This album is brilliant , though.What is relevant about SOAD is that they rock , and hard , too . Seamlessly blending eclectic influences into an immensely listenable stew that features flourishes of screaming thrash metal , punk , and even touches of folk music , they are unique . Their sound has been referred to as `` the bastard spawn of Frank Zappa and Slayer , '' which is about as close a description as one could peg on this band . Toxicity came out last year amidst a sea of other `` Nu-Metal '' albums , such as Slipknot 's `` Iowa , '' but `` Nu-Metal '' is something that SOAD does n't fit neatly into , for they are n't the 7-string guitar slinging , hip-hop beat-happy , mommy-hating posers that most of those guys are , they just happened to get popular around the same time as the `` Nu-Metallers . '' This album might seem uneven to some listeners , but after reading an interview with guitarist Daron Malakian , I realize that the sequence of songs and subject matter here is a touch of brilliant as well , for according to Malakian , `` our album is just like life -- completely frivolous and happy one moment , and completely serious the next . `` Serj Tankian is without a doubt the most talented singer in hard music today . He has the ability to go from a soft melodic vocal tone , to a bizarre carnival-barker 's voice , to a scholarly-sounding rant , to a blood curdling scream -- within the space of one song ! His lyrics are wonderful , too . Whether he 's writing about the utter stupidity of the U.S. 's laws on mandatory minimum sentencing for drug offenders -LRB- `` Prison Song '' -RRB- or waxing about the excesses of Hollywood and rock stardom -LRB- `` Psycho '' -RRB- his lyrics always make sense . They make you think , and laugh at the same time . A lyrical highlight can also be found in the song `` Needles , '' where Serj uses a tapeworm as a metaphor for a drug habit , and the chorus of the song is something you 'll be singing for days on end , making your closest friends go , `` What the -- ? ''
 TOXICITY ***** THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CDS AVAILABLE . SYSTEM OF A DOWN IS GREAT . I CANT CHOOSE A FAVORITE BECAUSE IT 'S JUST EXCELLENT . ALL 14 SONGS ON IT ARE GREAT . THEY ARE GREAT HEAVY METAL SINGERS . WHO IS THE LEAD SINGER . HE 'S EXCELLENT . THE INSTRUMENTS ARE AWESOME BUT IF I HAD TO CHOOSE ONE SONG I ABSOLUTELY LOVED ON THIS CD IT WOULD PROBABLY BE AERIALS . IF I HAD TO CHOOSE TWO THINGS TO KEEP IF I WAS STRANDED AND ALL I HAD WAS MY PORTABLE CD PLAYER AND HEADPHONES . THIS CD AND MY BEST FRIEND ARE WHAT I WOULD ASK FOR . I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS CD TO HEAVY METAL BEGGINNERS UP TO THE BIGGEST FANS OF HEAVY METAL . EVERYBODY SHOULD BUY THIS MUST OWN CD . IT RULES .
 I was lucky enough to go to Ozzfest for free by wining tickets , and they were the best band there , period . Their second CD is deffinintaly one of my best , and shows they can go from speed metal 1-2 trashes to calm melodic beats , and back . Any fan of Heavy Metal/Rock should and would like this album . BUY IT , IT ROCKS !!
 After Kurt Cobain died , music really went down the tubes . Rock music slipped into its biggest slump since the arrival of Disco in the 70s . Radio was plagued with nu-metal garbage like Korn -LRB- their first album was OK , but they pretty much -LCB- are bad -RCB- now -RRB- , Limp Bizkit -LRB- worst band ever -RRB- , Slipknot -LRB- second worst band ever , it 's not music , it 's all noise -RRB- , not to mention bands copying the style of the late , great Rage Against the Machine , plus Korn knockoffs , and all the pop garbage that was also starting to take over . To me , it seemed like the only bands that could produce good albums were those who had been around a long time , the youngest being the Dave Matthews Band.However , Toxicity made me reconsider . I had heard `` Chop Suey '' on the radio in my friend 's car , and thought it was interesting . A few months later , a friend at college introduced me to the album in all its glory . I found that many of the songs I actually kind of liked . It was n't until I borrowed it from a friend that I really decided , odd as it was , that I liked the album . For some odd reason , I did n't buy it until very recently , I wanted to buy some tapes for my new car -LRB- which does n't have a CD player -RRB- , and I came across a tape copy of Toxicity , and bought it.Not only is there finally an excellent hard rock album for the new millenium , it is in some ways comparable to classic albums . Serj Tankian is an excellent vocalist who can soar , moan , scream , shout , roar , and do the most original things with any consonant sound in the english language . Though the guitar playing is nothing like Jimmy Page or David Gilmour , Daron Malakian could be the best we 've heard since Tom Morello of Rage -LRB- I would say Kirk Hammett , but Rage was the best guitar band to come out after Metallica -RRB- . Malakian is the true musical genius behind the band , and it shows where the music is credited solely to him , in songs such as ATWA , Deer Dance , and Aerials . There is not one bad song on the entire album . All of the songs have memorable hooks in them , such as the Fred Durst impersonation in `` Prison Song , '' the chorus to `` Psycho , '' the word `` it '' in the line `` I do n't feel it anymore '' part of `` ATWA , '' the fast part of `` Chop Suey ! , '' the incredible harmonies in `` Aerials . '' It is hooks much like these that drove great classic bands like Pink Floyd , The Beatles , and Led Zeppelin to fame.Like I stated before , there is not one single bad song on the album , my favorite being `` Aerials '' with it 's beautiful harmonies , killer riffs , and excellent melody . The album opens with the rip-roaring `` Prison Song , '' starting off with a hit from the instrumentalists that will make you jump right out of your shoes if you have the volume previously turned up too loud . The amazing talents of Serj , both with his voice and the speed of his speech , will amaze all . Then we have `` Needles , '' another very catchy song , which then segues into `` Deer Dance , '' the first real burst of Daron 's genius on the album . `` Jet Pilot , '' is a fast paced song , the worst on the album , but I still like it enough not to fast-forward the tape . Then comes another fast-paced song `` X , '' short but really gets the adrenaline pumping . We all know the effect we get from hearing `` Chop Suey ! , '' the adrenaline starts pumping as soon as we hear beautiful opening chords . Then another fast-paced tune , reminiscent of their first album , `` Bounce , '' apparently about pogo sticks . `` I brought my pogo stick to show her a trick ... it was so exotic , '' did someone say `` sexual innuendo ? '' Closing the first side , we have `` Forest , '' a great song , not sure what it 's about , great music and lyrics though.Side 2 opens with one fo my favorites on the album , `` ATWA , '' apparently about Charles Manson . The song starts off slow , then unexpectedly kicks you in the -LCB- butt -RCB- as the band suddenly shifts from first gear straight to fifth . Then we have `` Science , '' a great song about how science has failed our world . The chorus to this song is what I mean about memorable hooks on this album , the words are `` Spirit moves through all things , '' but upon first listen it sounds like `` Spear , it moves through the whole thing . '' Listen to it and you 'll see . Next , we have another short fast song with `` Shimmy , '' which incorporates the use of of a middle eastern scale in one part , very cool . Following that is the rip-roaring `` Toxicity , '' you all know it , you 've all heard it , I do n't need to tell you anymore about it . `` Psycho , '' the current radio single , is also a great song with a memorable chorus -LRB- `` PSYCHO ! GROUPIE ! COCAINE ! CRAZY ! '' -RRB- and some of the best guitar work Daron has ever produced . Following that is my personal favorite , `` Aerials , '' which was the previous radio single , you all know that one as well , I do n't need to discuss it . As the final notes of `` Aerials '' fade out , we are treated to a little Armenian music , starting out with some sort of wind instrument , and then percussion and chants begin . This hidden track is one of the most beautiful things you will ever hear . After all that adrenaline that the album gave you , you are treated to this blissful piece of music , that leaves you wanting more and at the same time , totally at peace.It is inevitale that fans of nu-metal garbage will like this album . Just as people who like real music enjoy Rage Against the Machine , those same people will also enjoy System of a Down . I , like many people I know , hate rap-rock , but absolutely love Rage . These same people and myself feel the same way about nu-metal and System respectively . These guys pretty much saved modern rock for me , though I 'm still not convinced enough to turn on my radio dial . In the meantime , buy this album and realize that there may actually be hope for music in the near future as we await the next big , great , rock thing . Until then , buy this album , I guarantee you will not be disappointed .5 / 5
 In terms of quality , Toxicity is like many other albums . It has at least one excellent song -LRB- Aerials -RRB- , a couple standout tracks -LRB- Chop Suey , Toxicity -RRB- , some decent tunes -LRB- Science , Deer Dance -RRB- and the rest is largely filler . System of a Down , however , does seemingly filler tracks like nothing else . They generally follow a predictable pattern . Discordant , stop/start guitars that refuse to fall into a melodic pattern and a paranoid rant of some sort . While this does get rather annoying after a while , it provides for some unique , and ultimately interesting songs like Bounce , Prison Song , Shimmy and most recognizably , Psycho -LRB- who can resist a track with a chorus of `` Psycho ! Groupie ! Cocaine ! Crazy ! '' ? -RRB- . The rest of the songs on the album basically sound like the aforementioned filler tunes , but a lack of interesting lyrics or musical arrangement prevent them from being anything more than the same old , same old . All told , though , Toxicity is definitely a unique , above-average disc . I 'd probably give it 3.5 stars if Amazon allowed it , but I 'm feeling unusually optimistic at the moment . Aerials is simply an excellent song , one of the singles of 2002 . Although I hated Toxicity at first , it 's grown on me , and is generally a decent song . Chop Suey lacks some of the better elements of Aerials , though it 's the second-best song on the disc . Psycho should be required listening for any music fan . Toxicity is one of the better albums to come out recently , and is beyond a doubt one of the best hardcore / metal discs to be released as of late .
 I bought this CD a few months ago and when I heard it I loved it ! The Prison Song is great and kind of funny too
 Darin the guitar player has got amazing left and right hand chops making this music fast and furious not many people play that fast , and his guitars kick ... I scene them live he was dressed up like a girl it was funny !
 This is a great CD . I have listened to it a million times over and still get that same stoke whenever I hear Chop Suey or Toxicity . Serj graces the CD with his frantic and extremely talented style of singing . Chop Suey is one of the most vicious songs on the CD and has the most unbelievable ending . Daron and Serj 's voices have a great harmony and is set up to be quite possibly the strongest most powerful song . The stop and go style is great . Toxicity is more melodic then Chop Suey with a cool guitar part and the song is broken into two parts so you wo n't get bored . This seems to be a theme in all songs . There is no song on this CD that is the same all the way through . Every song gets changed up for the second half , so each song is totally unpredictable . You wo n't get bored . This CD ranges from poetic songs like Phsyco and super heavy songs like Shimmy . Its got everything a rock fanatic wants . Its superior to most every other album out there . Buy it . You 'll love it .
 This is on my top 10 list of all time great albums . Very fresh , very different . Ca n't get enough .
 i just got this cd for my b-day and it hasnt left my cd player since . this cd is so amazing . my favorite song is `` Aerials '' . the lyrics are so well written and the music to it is awesome . if u are thinkin about buyin this cd , stop thinkin and buy it .
 System of a down first came on the radio with the song that almost everyone knows , chop suey . Even then I liked them , but it was only on a whim that I bought their cd when I was in F.Y.E. one day . This cd has now become my favorite , and if you like chop suey or toxicity , then you 'll love their other songs . They go hard they go soft ; some are funny , sad , happy , angry , ... its all a big mixture that ultimately has you begging for more .
 System Of A Down Has Some Awesome Rock Songs.They Know How To Express Their Feelings Into Their Songs Such As Many Other Artists Do , But These People Put SOme Feeling Into Their Songs .
 This is a great cd.I have listened to this cd probably 20 times and it never gets old.All the songs are good .

 `` Chop Suey '' was a song intended to be a radio hit . They established themselves as a solid band . The problem with this band , accesibility . People do n't realize how vocally talented Serj actually is . The band definately revolves around his vocal in your face style which I like to compare to a boxing match . For example , a boxer looks to size up his opponent , and then attack with a flurry of punches , think of Serj 's style as that , a bit overdone and exaggerated in `` Chop Suey '' but well done throughout the rest of the album . Very solid all around album . Standout tracks for me - `` Psycho '' , `` X '' , but the album is all around good , and worthy of 4 Stars .
 This is just flat out the best rock cd ive ever heard . The best drummer ever , he even enspired me to play the drums . Really good guatarits . This gruop is really heavy and there drummer rocks , for example listen to the begining of needles . Do n't double think about buying it , just do it . you wont be sorry trust me
 The first album was really amazing and when I heard they had a new album coming out , I knew that it was going to be great and I was correct . The vocals and guitar work are truly excellent . This is not an industrial band , the just make good music period . I am a huge Slayer fan also . So far System of a down and Slayer are the only bands that I know of the have n't yet gone commercial and hopefully never will .
 This album rules . Since the last release , `` System of a Down '' , the group has been touring alot , and Terj , the lead singer , has developed greatly . All the tracks are excellent , especially Chop Suey ! and Aerials . The bonus CD-Rom has some great features for any big fan .
 System of A Down somehow manages to combine the political content of Rage Against The Machine , the emotion of Tool and the music of ... well , SOAD . The vocals are quite unique , being more than the sum of their parts
 At first listen i was a little unsure . I really loved the first album and at any volume it was played seemed to have a huge impact . On this one it did n't seem as the raw production was there . Ever since then tho it has really grown on me . Tracks like ` Prison Song ' , ` Needles ' , ` Chop Suey ! ' and ` Toxicity ' are the obvious stand out tracks that are the selling point for the album , but there is something so special and original in every track . Tracks like ` Shimmy ' seem to have a pop element in the chorus and you ca n't avoid tapping your feet to it . There are also mellow tracks on this album to break up the noise onslaught every once in a while , tracks like ` ATWA ' and ` Aerials ' highlight this . This is an album you need if you are into hard rock but are looking for something a little bit more original . What a superb album !
 System of a Down is one of the best bands out today . This bands music is so unique and the singer , Serj Tankian , has one of the best voices I have ever heard . It 's hard to think that System can make this album any better than the first one because their first album was outstanding but they did . This album is one of the best albums I heard in a long time . They come right at you from the beginning with `` Prison Song '' and end with the musical song `` Arto '' . The whole album is good but there are a few songs that really stand out on this album . `` Forest '' might be their best song ever , `` Deer Dance '' is one of the hardest songs on the album and the song `` Science '' is one of their best as well . To anyone looking for a great rock album look no further . This album should put System of a Down on the map with all the other great rock groups . If you are looking for an album that you want to listen to over and over again , buy this album immediately . It gets better everytime you listen to it . This album is a must have in anyones cd collection . You will not regret this one bit .

 System of a Down , coming from a superior debut releases this sophomore release and it does not disappoint . They remain around their roots and yet are able to produce new sounds never befor heard . This album is filled w / anthems that make you question your youth . And I LOVE IT . Your parents will hate it , and that 's the way Rock and Roll should always seen . The cd-rom is an interesting feature and it makes owning this version special . You should purchase it w/out a second thought , especially if you loved the first .
 If these songs do n't get your blood flowing , I do n't know what will . Most of them are mind-blowingly intense . And I dare you to try to keep up with Serj Tankian 's vocals . A few of the songs frequently change back and forth between being fast-paced and being slow and sensitive , and the guys pull it off excellently . If you liked System 's first album , ` Toxicity ' will blow you away . By the way , if you buy ` Toxicity , ' make sure you get the Limited Edition . It includes a CD-ROM containing some great footage of the recording process , including commentaries from each band member .
 This album is the most amazing hard rock I have heard in years . System Of A Down has put together an Album better that the first . If you like the first album you will love Toxicity . I can listen to the whole CD over and over again if you like hard rock ... This is a must buy .
 This album is beyond genious . System of a Down are one of the few bands today to pull of such amazing work . They are probably one of the most talented bands ever . Every song on here is amazing . I especially like ATWA and Aerials . SOAD mix metal and melody and make it sound absolutely incredible . Buy this album !! You wont be disappointed . Check them out on the Pledge of Allegiance tour with Slipknot . Get slipknot too !!!!! So many cds !!!
 for this album ! I must say this is an awesome album from SOAD . Although I 've heard how great this was going to be it certainly exceeded my expectations ! With 14 tracks in all , its great all the way through with a great blend of hardcore and melodic tunes much to the credit of the emotional vocals from singer Serj . I definitely recommend this anyone ! Go buy it now !
 System Of A Down , the greatest band EVER , have yet another great album . Their songs cover issues such as the prison system , the brutality of riot police and many others . It 's interesting to just sit back with them blasting on your Discman , while you read the lyrics . You 'll probably start making up your own song meanings -LRB- I know a lot of people that have done that -RRB- , and you might actually look at current issues in a different way .
 This CD is totally awesome . If you are a fan of hard rock this is the CD for you . At first it took me awhile to actually enjoy it , but after listening to a couple of the songs I was hooked . The guitar on some of these songs , such as `` Bounce '' , `` Chop Suey ! '' , and `` Prison Song '' have a great beat . My favorite songs , besides the ones I 've already mentioned , are `` X '' and `` Shimmy '' and the rest of the songs are great too . I bought this CD with some doubt in mind , but after hearing it I really love this CD and its up with my top favs . The lyrics -LRB- which totally rock -RRB- , the guitar , and their voices combined make up an awesome package . Buy this CD and you WILL NOT be let down .
 1 -RRB- chop suey ! ~ this song is the best song ... there isnt really a `` logical '' reason they just got everything right aobut it ! 2 -RRB- prison song ~ this song kicks major -LSB- butt -RSB- ! no need to explain , just listen to it and u 'll know what i 'm talking about3 -RRB- bounce ~ this song made me laugh so hard ! it wasnt ... um ... very hardcore or ne-thing it was just funny ! 4 -RRB- deer dance ~ omg ! i freaking love this song , i know that i know sound like a groupie/valley girl but it is seriously that good ! 5 -RRB- toxicity ~ maybe it 's because of all the repetion , on the radio and stuff , but this song is really cool and i really grew to like it . ~ over all , this whole album rocks ! i love every song and now i am a huge fan of SOAD
 Wow , you know , I 've really missed out on this band . I always assumed they were just another `` numetal '' band that was n't worth my time , so I never really listened to them much . But , I decided to borrow this album and the debut from a friend , just to see what I thought of them . I listened to the debut first , and it blew me away . Aside from `` Sugar '' , every song on it is just amazing . So , I could n't wait to hear what this one sounded like . Well , it 's mostly the same , though not near as good . I like that they have put more melody into it , and as such made a slightly more varied album , but still , there is something missing . For one thing , the music is n't quite as technical as on the debut . There are n't near as many solos and wild rhythm changes , even though it still far exceeds that of the average numetal band . Another thing is that there are too many weird short songs that do n't really go anywhere or do anything . There 's at least four of them , and `` Bounce '' is the most unlistenable of them all -LRB- funny , but unlistenable -RRB- . Out of the `` normal '' songs -LRB- the ones that exceed 2 minutes -RRB- , there 's plenty to enjoy . Faves would have to be `` Science '' , `` Deer Dance '' , `` Aerials '' , and the title track . `` Chop Suey '' is kind of like `` Sugar '' , in that it 's the most commercially successful song , and yet does n't do much for me . It 's ok , but there are much better songs to be found here.Aside from the fact that the level of technicality is slightly lower , the musicians are still in fine form . Daron puts on an excellent performance on the guitar -LRB- though there need to be more leads -RRB- , and John still pounds the skins admirably . The basslines are n't as audible as on the debut , but then they are n't that impressive anyway . Serj is just crazier than ever , still making use of his amazing range . He also sings softly moreso than on the debut , which is good , because he 's got a great singing voice . At times , he almost reminds me of Ed Kowalczyck from Live . The lyrics are even weirder than before , and that says a lot . What do you have to be on to come up with something like `` Jet Pilot '' ? If you liked the debut , you 'll probably like this too , but personally I do n't think it 's anywhere near as good . They made some progressions , but it 's just not as consistently brilliant . I really wish people would stop calling this band `` numetal '' . Numetal is boring trash like Limp Bizkit and the Deftones . That title does not do this band justice .
 With many modern bands sounding interchangeable , System of a Down has come along and saved the day . With a distinct sound all the way around , from lyrics and vocals to guitar and percussion , this band will not be mistaken for anyone else.This uniqueness is truely a breath of fresh air , and has made System of a Down one of my favorite bands.If you want something really different , and increadibly awesome , try System of a Down ... They will blow you away !
 -LRB- ... -RRB- Being an `` old school '' fan of real bands and music , Systems of a Down delivers real and true earcandy ; one only has to listen to their first 1998 album to know that this band had something special . Their sophomore effect in no way disappoints but rather kicks you -LRB- ... -RRB- with such songs as `` Prison '' and `` Needles . `` System of a Down 's Armenian background is proudly displayed by their incorporation of hardcore music with definite Middle Eastern overtones ... just the deliverance of Serj Tankian 's unique vocal style combined with Daron Malakian 's aggressive guitar riffs hits new heights of musical ecstasy -- a must hear for true hardcore fans.While this type of music is not for everyone , you may have to develop a taste for it , it truly worth the time to tickle your tastebuds with something new .
 and one of the most distinctive and beautiful albums in the history of rock music.i wo n't even attempt to describe this album , other than that if you 're at all turned off by the screaming - do n't worry . something about this cd voids that screaming down to just music . it 's more `` shouting '' rather than screaming , if you know what i mean ... it 's just an incredibly beautiful cd , but it is the epitome of the `` let it sink in '' album.you most likely will not like this album the first time you hear it , almsot definitely if you 're already in no way familiar with them , but it will sink in . it is n't silly , this is emotional music . it 's beautiful and deep music . it 's art in a very unpretentious honest way . just get it . ~ will
 I was a little afraid to get this album at first , because by the time I had decided to , System Of A Down had already dominated the metal scene and `` Chop Suey ! '' was everywhere , the radio , TV , at school . I was apprehensive , because buying this meant I was jumping onto a bandwagon -LRB- something I hate doing -RRB- . Well , it did n't matter in the end , and that goes for anyone who feels that way because THIS CD KICKS @ - $ - $ ! California has been a place spawning nu-metal bands for a while now , such as SOAD 's peers KoRn and Incubus . However , SOAD has their own unique style , which really shows on this killer CD . I remember not really caring for their first CD , but `` Chop Suey ! '' really grabbed my attention when I first heard it way back in August . Other awesome highlights of Toxicity are `` Science , '' which is a thrashy song with a Middle-Eastern sounding melody . `` Psycho '' is an equally fast song that deals with cocaine addicts . Surprisingly , the song ends rather melodiously , when , listening to the rest of the song , you 'd expect a different ending completely . There are probably only two down points to this whole album :1 . Occasionally vocalist Serj Tankian 's voice sounds so incredibly warped that you question the dude 's sanity . This tweaked screeching mixed with guitarist Daron Malakian 's odd high-pitched whining can really turn you off some songs .2 . Many songs fall under the two-minute mark in length , not giving you a fair chance to enjoy the song before it is over.Other than that , Toxicity is an awesome album , almost rivaling Incubus 's S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and surpassing Korn 's s/t . If you like thrashy metal with killer grooves and harmonious , melodic singing and guitar , buy SOAD 's sophomore album , Toxicity . Heh , that 's funny ... listening to it , you 'd think this was their 4th or 5th outing , it 's so well done ...
 Well System has done it again ! Before I heard these guys , I hated heavy metal . I 'm not even sure if you could classify SOAD as `` Heavy Metal . '' I believe they have their own style of music that only they can name . My buddy got me listening to them and I instantly fell in love with their music . I do n't believe their music could ever get old . Undying music blessed with talent . I have a lot of respect for SOAD . A lot of their songs are about society and issues such as war . I 've learned quite a bit from this band . Before I got into them , I had no idea that there was an Armenian genocide before the World War -LRB- Armenian Genocide of 1915 -RRB- . Did you know that ? It would n't be a surprise that a few of their songs are about the genocide . Considering that all four of them are of Armenian heritage . Everything that I look for in a band SOAD has . A great vocalist , talented song writing , an awesome guitarist , a very good bassist and drummer . All of these components make up one of the best bands ever . None of the songs sound the same . Each of them hold their own sound and has their own inviduality . One thing that I love about Toxicity is that the songs change pace quickly . For example Deer Dance . It starts off hardcore and towards the end it sends out a mellow vibe . If you 're the kind of person that likes music that 's all thrash and that have vocalists that sing in deep blunt tones -LRB- no talents -RRB- , then do n't get this CD . It will truly disappoint you . But if you are an open minded invidual that is able to look at issues in someone else 's perspective , give this CD a shot . I loved every single song on it . A lot of people wo n't buy this CD because Chop Suey ! is too `` overplayed . '' And if they got this CD they would be `` posers . '' Oh no !! HEAVEN forbid that . I do n't understand that concept . People should n't like songs from semi-popular to popular bands ? That concept just does n't make sense to me . What 's the benefit of liking a band that is n't popular ? The only thing I can come up with is cheaper concert tickets . It just annoys me that people wo n't even try something because `` everyone '' listens to it . Next time when my friends and I go to a pizza joint , I should warn them that they should n't eat pizza because of it 's popularity amongst Americans . Stupid example I have presented , I know . Just as stupid as the reasons for disliking popular bands . Ok sorry for rolling off topic . I 'm about done . Alrighty have a lovely day ... GO SOAD !!
 I just started to listen to Rock and this cd brought me into it as well . I really dig this group.Keep it up
 I 'll admit . I was a bit skeptical about System of A Down 's sophmore album Toxic City at first . Thinking there is no way s.o.a.d. could top their self titled debut . HOWEVER ! its amazing how this great band captured that energizing feeling yet again in Toxic City . I have yet to purchase this cd yet due to lack of money ... . but that is the ONLY reason . My brother on the other hand has already bought it , and so Ive listened to it a few times , it is simply remarkable and very commendable that Shavo , Serj , Darren and John have given us another tremendous album to mosh and headbang to ! If you havent already , BUY THIS ALBUM !
 This has got to be the release of the year ! No one sounds like these guys . The voice of serg is totally different than any other , along with background grunts and growls from daron makes this group a force . As musicians , they are very talented . They incorporate the hard slayer style riffs as well as classical guitar riffs too . If you are looking for something new and hate the `` pop '' scene and mtv , buy this . Hopefully they wo n't go too mainstream . NSYNC SUCKS !
 Buy this album now . It is so incredibly rich sounding ... like eating pure butter but in convenient music form . Smooth , mellow , strange , quirky , and at times incredibly hard ... buy it now .
 First off , I will say that I am by no means a metal listener . Then again , this is n't a conventional metal album.The album does feature a lot of harsh sounds but there are just as many tranquil and quirky noises thrown into the mix . System of a Downs ` Toxicity ' is a very refreshing album and is definitely worth checking out !
 After hearing about System of a Down and seeing the video for `` Sugar '' , in 1998 , I bought their first record . I found it extremely interesting how the band incorporates Armenian elements into their heavy metal sound ; its a very unique style of music . Their second album is better than their first in almost every single way imaginable . The songs are more focused , there is a greater sense of melody , and the lyrics are more thought-provoking . There is no track on this record that i skip , whenever i listen to it I listen to every song . Thats a big compliment .
 This iz the best album yet . Everyone should get it . HIGHLY RECOMENDED !
 This Armenian quartet did the impossible in my opinion.They released a much harder and better album than their self-titled debut ! The disc starts off with the quirky Prison Song.Needles is a thrash metal fest ! This disc overall has better songs with real flair and catchiness.Evident are political and personal issues in their lyrics.This time around though the music truly backs up Serj Tankian 's lyrics to full effect ! You can feel his anger literally.They also have the dark humor needed to make the right twist.Disc 2 includes multimedia for the pc.Basically all of it is outtakes and the process in making of this album.This is undoubtedly essential and truly unbelievable.Got get this !
 The first time I plugged into SOD I was a little miffed at the unique sound of this guys voice . I must say I did n't like it , at first ... until the guitars kicked in with their punk-like metal riffs and this guy 's screaming in perfect harmony . I was addicted ever since.This album not only compliments their first but is better . The songs are more dynamic and slighty more hard-core . The lyrics have a message ranging from drugs to relationships to politics to give each song a purpose . Spin this CD , I highly recommend it . '' ... and ... ... angels ... deserve ... to ... ... DIE !!!!!!!!!!!!!! ''

 Back with avengances and rockin harder than ever . This CD is soooooo much better than the first one , w/o taking anything away from the first one which was great , this is definettly a great progression as a band , and they didnt loose their passion or anger like some bands of late ... Tool , Staind , etc. . . you see the pattern . where all those bands try and be mellow and then rock like they used to cant pull it off like SOAD proved they can do AGAIN ! Get this album if you 're a SOAD fan you wont regret it at all ... . THIS KICKS
 `` Toxicity '' , System of a Down 's sophmore album is undoubtably one of the greatest Rock albums . The timing of this album really set a tone for rock music . Debuting at # 1 the day after 9/11 and having their hit song `` Chop Suey ! '' banned from the airwaves . Sine then SOAD has becoming one of the biggest bands in rock music today . But lets get back on the subject ; There are many words I could use to describe this album but one particularly comes to mind ... Crazy . From thrashing tracks like `` Needles '' and `` Psycho '' to more melodic tracks like `` Chop Suey ! '' and `` Arieals '' . Every SOAD fan needs to have this album . Nevermind my babble , here is the individual rating on each awesome track :1 . Prison Song - -LRB- 10/10 -RRB- - One of the best opener songs I 've heard in a while . Hard hitting lyrics with thrashing guitars licks.This song obviously contains material of prison and statistics too . Not only is it kick * ss , but educational too ... 2 . Needles -LRB- 10/10 -RRB- - The very first time I heard this I didnt think much of it . Then as I listened more to lyrics and understood it I got the picture . Remember , you have to have an open mind when listening to SOAD .3 . Deer Dance - -LRB- 10/10 -RRB- - One of my favorite SOAD tracks of all time . The verses of this song are breath taking . Darons work is awesome as usual . Bravo .4 . Jet Pilot - -LRB- 9/10 -RRB- - A pretty typical SOAD song . Very heavy and Serj lets out on some fast paced singing .5 . X - -LRB- 10/10 -RRB- - I enjoy this one alot more then Jet Pilot . The layout of the song is pretty much the same as JP .6 . Chop Suey ! - -LRB- 13/10 -RRB- - The stand out song on this album and of its time of release . In the summer of 01 ' the rock charts were ruled by bands like Sum 41 and Blink 182 but SOAD stood out like a light in a dark room and pumped up toxicitys hype .7 . Bounce - -LRB- 10/10 -RRB- - This song knocks you back into toxicitys normal flow . It has a cute little story in this track .8 . Forest - -LRB- 10/10 -RRB- - Another one of my favorite songs . All the chemicals came together for this one with astonishing lyrics .9 . ATWA - -LRB- 10/10 -RRB- - A slow , but heavy song . Alot of people consider this the best song but I dont wan na get over my head here .10 . Science - -LRB- 10/10 -RRB- - In the middle of this song all of these weird noises come in and take you completely out of the album . Tribal noises , some kind of horn , It 'll have you scratching your head .11 . Shimmy -LRB- 10/10 -RRB- - The most fun song of the alubm . `` Im gon na shimmy shimmy shimmy till the break of dawn , yeah ! '' One of the best SOAD lyrics .12 . Toxicity - -LRB- 10/10 -RRB- - The 2nd single . Serj rules all with his simplicit yet soulful singing and weird outburt in the end of this song . The video for this was also amazing .13 . Psycho - -LRB- 10/10 -RRB- - Another SOAD song about cocaine . Throw in a little Sex material and crazyniess and you have the perfect Las vegas anthem here .14 . Aerials -LRB- 10/10 -RRB- - The most over played SOAD song since before BYOB . But it honestly deserved it . A truly epic song If I may say . Everything flows perfectly and earns the title of the most succesful song on this album.All in all , it is a classic album . It is compared to Nevermind , Pretty hate machine , and other Rock classis LP 's . Also pick up Mezmerize / Hypnotize and all the other SOAD albums . They are all worth the price of a couple bucks .
 System 's best CD yet !! It does n't have the same feel of either of their other albums . Their self-titled CD was too dark , and , while still awesome , Steal This Album was full of B-sides and other useless songs.Prison Song
 Ever since `` Chop Suey ! '' made it 's way somehow into the rock mainstream with it 's chorus of `` I do n't think you trust in my sellf-righteous suicide '' existing behind the unique arrangements -LRB- appealing to similar fake angst bands like Papa Roach -RRB- , System Of A Down have been talked about incessantly and most of the talkers only know of that one song . Despite all the hype , this is still a very good if somewhat samey album that weaves in politics with occasionally imaginative lyrics and a fine mixture of mostly Arabian and death metal styles . The first three songs are full up with political appeal , `` Prison Song '' and `` Needles '' are some great attacks against the drug industry and its sinister controlling potentials , the latter of the two features the band tackling on some hardcore ` hey hey ' punk ska . Other political lyrics are found in `` X '' -LRB- speaking out against the endless propagation and nullifying of fascist governments -RRB- , `` Science '' -LRB- all about how the rationality of the modern world has destroyed the imagination and freedom of the world -RRB- , and here and there in other songs which are more ambiguous to pinpoint if they 're political or aestethic . More free and less down your throat songs are `` Jet Pilot '' -LRB- `` Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot/One that smiled as he flew over the bay ! '' -RRB- , `` Pogo '' -LRB- relating a sexual orgy fantasy where a pogostick is obviously a metaphor for a part of the human body -RRB- , `` Forest '' -LRB- possibly my favorite here , `` Why do n't you know that you are my son ... '' -RRB- , the title track which is also one of the main highlights of the album -LRB- '' ... eating seeds as a pasttime activity ... '' -RRB- and `` Shimmy '' is kind of inbetween . `` Aerials '' and `` Atwa '' are the more mellow of the set , real good songs ca n't remember the lyrics right now but they rock . Despite `` Chop Suey ! '' and its mainstream penetration , it is one of the more style-shifting of the set and easily appealable . So that I do n't leave any songs out there 's also `` Psycho '' , a catchy tempo-altering tune about a drug addict fan , and the AFrican-drum filled bonus track is an entertaining indicator of future releases . The result is straitforwardly rocking fusion of metal and Arabic music cultures , which can make you jam and think simultaneously like an At The Drive-In or Fugazi record .
 ... but System managed to beat the sophomore slump . Toxicity is the second full-length album from the Armenian metal quartet , and it is head and shoulders above it 's current peers in the music world . Serj and crew draw on many things for the content in these songs ; the mushrooming Prison-Industrial complex in the US , Corruption , State-sponsored violence , sex , drugs etc , and every song has not only thoughtful lyrics for us to ponder , but also stunning musical range to enjoy . `` Chop Suey '' is probably the best-executed song on the album . The rhythm changes are catchy , and Serj 's stop-start singing style is infectious . The unifying ingredient proves to be the beautifully sung chorus and final breakdown section where Serj dazzles us with the soulful side of his voice . The song is a bona fide hit , and any metal band that gets a video into semi-regular play on MTV must be doing something right in that department . `` Needles '' is at times humorous , but mostly sinister , and contains one of the most hauntinglt beautiful vocal sections where Serj sings
 At one time , System of a Down was a band I had heard little about . I had heard about but never actually heard `` Sugar '' . I saw the `` Chop Suey '' video on MTV a few times and I got addicted to the song , which drove me to go out and pick up this CD as soon as I could . Now , being a more of a fan of bands like Green Day and The Offspring , this music was a little on the heavy side for me . However , I was patient with it and by about the 3rd or 4th listen it really clicked!Prison Song - A protest song about the Prison system of the US . It 's really good and the constant screaming adds alot of edge . -LRB- like on most of the other songs -RRB- 9/10Needles - This one has always been one of my favorite on the album . I just love the meaning of the song and the chorus is awesome and never gets old ! 10/10Deer Dance - The heavy intro to this song is great , and the verse following it is even better . Along with Needles , this song definately has the best chorus on the album , but it 's verses are much better than those on Needles . 11/10Jet Pilot - Pretty good , but not the best . Everything about this song would be excellent for say . . a Limp Bizkit album , but this is a System of a Down album , and it just does n't measure up to everything else . 7/10X - I really did n't like this one much at first , but it is slowly growing on me . It 's really got a great chorus and the verses are decent . Too short . 7.5 / 10Chop Suey - Great everything , plus jam packed with emotion . The song that drove me to but this masterpeice . I know it 's been all over MTV and everything , but it still never gets old for me . 9/10Bounce - At first I thought this was just weird song about a Pogo Stick of all thing , but when you really listen to it it 's about girls , and that is sort of strange because System usually talks about more serious things . Yet , the music is really great and moshable . 8/10Forest - I really like Forest , it 's probably my favorite on the whole album right now . It has probably the best guitar out of anything on this . The chorus is one of the more emotional and thought provoking and Serj 's vocals also shine more than usual . 10/10Atwa - This is the first of the slower songs on this CD . I like it , but it 's not really that great compared to the title track or any other song on this . Again , this would really work on a different bands album , but there is much better on this CD .6.5 / 10Shimmy - This is another one that took a long time for me to get into , but now I really love it . The chorus is possibly the best on the album , rivaling that of the title track . 10/10Toxicity - If you happen to have a dial up connection and do n't want to go through the pain of downloading every song on this album , then just download this one . Everything about this song is fantastic , and it is thought-provoking in more ways than one . 11/10Psycho - This one is not really that great at all in any respect , but it is fun to listen to , and thats important ! 7.5 / 10Aerials - I have n't really fully discovered this song , but hopefully I will in the near future . . ? / ? This CD is probably the best music reflecting on September 11th that I can think of , even if it was released the week before . All in all , a wonderful release that should be heard by all .
 The second release from Armenian-American metal group System Of A Down , entitled `` Toxicity '' , is nothing short of incredible . It far surpassed my original idea on how the album would be . I heard most of the album before it had come out and it blew me away.This album is much better than their first album . Singer Serj Tankian demonstrates that he not only can scream but has incredible vocal ability , which , I feel , is most evident on their single `` Chop Suey ! '' Tankian 's distinctive vocals mix with the insanity of the guitar work of Daron Malakian , who also lends a hand on vocals on certain tracks . Setting the rhythm of the songs are bassist Shavo Odadjian and drummer John Dolmayan , who add a solid and consistant power to each song.There is no weak song on this album . Every song is good in its own way since each song is different from the other . Their lyrics are very diverse , ranging from the United States prison system -LRB- Prison Song -RRB- to sympathy for Charles Manson -LRB- ATWA -RRB- to pogosticks -LRB- Bounce -RRB- . As diverse as they may be , they are strong.I feel that the best tracks on the album are Prison Song , Deer Dance , Chop Suey , ATWA , Science , Shimmy , Toxicity and Psycho.If you like the music of the newer metal bands , then this is most definitely your best bet . One of the best releases of the summer of 2001 . If you are a fan of System of a Down and you do n't have this album , you must pick it up . If you just got into the band from the song `` Spiders '' and do n't like any of their other songs , you do n't know what you are missing .
 I was a little bit skeptical before buying this cd last week . I was n't too much of a fan of ` Sugar ' which was a big hit a couple years ago , so I at first dismissed System as another -LSB- ... -RSB- MTV band . Hearing ` Chop Suey ! ' on the radio over the summer gave me second thoughts . I 'm going to give the first cd a well-deserved second chance now.I bought the cd , put it in , then ` Prison Song ' hit right away . The opener is probably one of the best , if not the best song on the cd . It 's a very hard , upbeat song dealing with the drug war and prison systems . This cd has its fast parts -LRB- Prison Song , Deer Dance , X -RRB- , its slow parts -LRB- Chop Suey ! ATWA , Aerials -RRB- , and its weird and kooky parts -LRB- Bounce , Shimmy , Psycho -RRB- that made them what they were before , and made the fast faster , the slow slower , and the kooky kookier . They experiment a lot of different time signatures and tempo changes , as well as using different levels of guitar distortion . From heavy distortion to clean electric , to acoustic . Serj Tankian switches his vocal setting many times during the cd ... often many times during one song . From crooning , to screaming , to singing very very quicky -LRB- first couple verses of ` Prison Song ' , chorus of ` Psycho ' . He 's also penned some very good lyrics which have some truth behind them and are fun to sing along with . About every instrument is noteworthy from Daron 's guitar , and Shavo 's bass , to John 's hard and fast drumming . The use of keyboards is also evident on a couple songs -LRB- ` Chop Suey ! ' , ` Aerials ' -RRB- . The bonus disc includes footage from live shows and backstage . Also a `` Making Of '' feature with more behind the scenes stuff . This is a very diverse cd full of lots of different sounds and tempos . It 's refreshing in this sad `` verse , chorus , verse '' to have some different stuff . I 'd recommend this to just about anyone who is looking for a break from rap metal and manufactured `` nu-metal '' .
 Toxicity may very well be better than System of a Down 's self-titled release . That is a bold statement considering how great the self-titled was . SoaD have definitely progressed from their hard-hitting debut , while still keeping the core sound that made System of a Down one of the most exciting and intriguing releases in recent memory . In Toxicity , SoaD have made a near-perfect blend of fine-tuned melody and pounding , in-your-face thrash . The best , and most accesible , example of this is the first single , `` Chopy Suey ! '' It starts soft , then immediately picks up into heavy riffs . Suddenly it stops on a dime and makes a seamless transition into the melodic chorus , and then launches off into another heavy verse.The first half of the album is arguably a little weaker than the latter half , but this does not detract from the listening experience . The sheer momentum of the fast , heavy tracks carries the listener through the first five songs with some melodic moments -LRB- The bridge in Deer Dance comes to mind -RRB- into ` Chop Suey ! ' , where the bands expanded melodicism begins to burrow itself within the tightly-crafted song structures . The song ` Bounce ' shrugs it off , but ` Forest ' attacks with nice melodies and massive hooks . ` ATWA ' is one of the softest songs on the CD , and it 's very nice . ` Science ' is another great track with a catchy chorus . ` Shimmy ' breaks away from sound of the latter half of the CD with cooky lyrics and heavy instruments . The title track is interesting and takes a little getting used to because of how the vocals were arranged . ` Psycho ' is heavy and cooky in parts , and melodic and cooky in other parts . Near the end is a wonderful guitar solo , which is surprising . A welcome surprise . ` Aerials ' is a phenomenal track with beautiful melodies and huge hooks . After ` Aerials ' is over , a few seconds will pass and ` Arto ' , the hidden track , will come on . It has a very tribal feel a la Sepultura ; it 's a good way to close the album.My only gripes with the CD is that many songs are short , and the album length is only 44 minutes . Other than that , it 's good . Very good . If you are a fan of System of a Down , you must get this album . If you did n't like the first album much , and are looking into Toxicity , I highly recommend it to you . Toxicity is a breath of fresh air among all of the putrid crap plaguing us today . If you are looking for something a different and interesting , Toxicity is for you.My favorite tracks
 I know this cd is pretty old now , but I still crank this cd up . Every single cd is the best !!!! How do they do it ? If you do not have this cd , BUY IT !!
 There were two much-anticipated metal releases this year ; one , Slipknot 's Iowa , nearly lived up to the potential of their debut , but System Of A Down 's uneven , but energetic and smouldering new album -LRB- produced by the great Rick Rubin -RRB- , Toxicity , elevates the Armenian-American quartet to among the elite in hard rock today . No other metal band today is so adept at combining the aggression of aggro , unique melodies , and political consciousness as these guys.At their best , SOAD sound like the best rock band on the planet . ` Needles ' features the best fast-fingered riffs this side of Slayer , while the phenomenal ` Deer Dance ' puts a demented Middle Eastern twist on the grinding guitar rhythms Anthrax perfected fifteen years ago . ` Jet Pilot ' is just plain exciting , two insane minutes of severe energy . Best of all are the spectacular ` Chop Suey ' and ` Aerials ' , whose combinations of time changes and harmonies show auch an an intense band is capable of showing some soul without reverting to the pathetic whining that pervades nu-metal these days . Serj Tankian 's powerful singing of `` fatherwhy have you forsaken me '' in the awesome bridge in ` Chop Suey ' is thrilling to hear.Toxixity would have been awfully close to perfect if it were n't for a few songs that threaten to bring the entire album back into the realm of the sophomoric . ` Bounce ' , ` Shimmy ' , and ` Psycho ' , though musically as enthralling as the rest , are thematically stupid , sounding nothing more than frat-boy rants , and completely clash with the intelligence shown in the other twelve songs.The real star of the album is the vocal talent of Tankian . There is no other hard rock vocalist as talented as he right now , a singer capable of screaming like Tom Araya , growling like Corey Taylor , ranting like Jello Biafra , and belting out the notes like Bruce Dickinson ... all in the same song . He actually makes the huge line `` All research and successful drug policy show that treatment should be increased and law enforcement decreased while abolishing mandatory minimum sentences '' fit into a song without losing a breath . His lyrics can be a bit pretentious -LRB- `` self-righteous suicide '' ? Come on ... -RRB- , but I 'll take a bit of pretentiousness over banality any day.With Toxicity , SOAD comes very close to reaching new heights in heavy music , and this is only their second album . Their musical potential is staggering , and they should only get better .
 This album is impossible to hate . I would find it hard to believe for a true rocker to dislike this album . It 's got amazing drum parts that seem to change speeds from fast to slow , from soft to hard . The drums are also pretty much metal . The only thing they lack is the double bass and hard crashs.The bass was another key metal factor in this album . It 's heavy and can be heard well throughout the album . It 's heavy and creative , which is way different from most hard rock.The guitars are the most lacking part of the album . There is no originality in the parts and no solos . Other than that it 's good hard rock . The vocals are totally kickass and will blow you away the first time you hear 'em .
 BUY IT NOW ! DO N'T WAIT!At first this cd did not click with me . After one month and a few more listens I started to warm up to it fast . Then Wham ... it hit me hard . This CD just ROCKS ! It slams you hard and does not let go at all . The progressive-hard core , cutting edge , political songs just blow all other albums out of the water . It is so refreshing to hear something new ... something better than the tired tripe on the radio . If you have only heard Toxicity , Chop Suey and Aerials then you are in for a wonderful ride . It is a MUST have . It is even better than their 1st album . Give it a chance . It will be more than worth it . I personally like the first 6 songs the best -LRB- see the other reviews for the titles -RRB- , but the rest of the album is no slouch . I always have it around now . It has moved up in my cd rotation to the top tier !
 Not surprisingly , Toxicity was my first SOAD album since I bought it because of the over-crazed Chop Suey . I listened to it after getting it and did n't think much of it , until a year or two later after I got `` Steal this Album '' and their first one . Since then , I have been an adamant System fanatic . Toxicity compares to it 's counterparts in that it 's more heavy and feral . The riffs , interlude/solo parts are alot more concentrated and powerful but that 's one aspect that makes the album great.Prison Song -LRB- 9/10 -RRB- - Amazing . I actually hated this song until relatively recently because it repeated the chorus too much . However I like the political message and the riffs are strong.Needles -LRB- 10/10 -RRB- - This is possibly my favorite song on the album . Since I listen to death metal/power metal as well , I really love the heavy punch this song throws . The drums are unusually pronounced in this song , giving a more thrashing feeling , while Malakian 's singing solo is the best aspect of this album.Deer Dance -LRB- 8/10 -RRB- - Not one of my favorites but still a good song . The sequence singing -LRB- heh , Vivaldi would turn in his grave -RRB- is remarkable , and Malakian 's support singing is great as well . Repeated chorus too much at the end tho.Jet Pilot -LRB- 7/10 -RRB- - A relatively weird song as far as SOAD goes . Not sure if this song has an underlying message , so I apparently do n't know it . Switches between light and heavy very quickly -LRB- not that it 's bad -RRB- . Pretty redundant as far as lyrics go.X -LRB- 7/10 -RRB- - Nice intro , heavy and proclaimatory leading into the main flow of the song . Pretty short -LSB- song -RSB- and repetitive but it 's still not bad.Chop Suey ! -LRB- 10/10 -RRB- - No , no , I did n't give this a 10 because it 's the popular SOAD song . This truly is great and it deserved to be a single . It 's a unique and welcome variation from all the dull singles floating around at the time . I loved this song so much at one point that I translated it into Latin !! Eh , anyways , Biblical reference , abundant screaming , and emotional choruses make this song truly great.Bounce -LRB- 10/10 -RRB- - Probably the weirdest song on the album , and I LOVE IT FOR THAT . Generally I dislike reptition but it 's so neccessary and instrumental in the effect of this song , which by the way is about an orgy . All there 's left to say about this song is
 okay i 'm just gon na lay it out : prison song - 9.5 / 10 - super cool song , ca n't get enoughneedles - 8/10 makes for good listening , sometimesdeer dance - 8.5 / 10 - heavy song , very goodjet pilot - 8/10 - kinda weirdx - 10/10 - I LOVE THIS SONG !!! chop suey - 10/10 - man i love the faced paced style of this songbounce - 7/10 - i do n't really like this song but it 's okayforest - 8.5 / 10 - defenitly a song worth listening toatwa - 8/10 - one of the songs i usually skip byscience - 8/10 - i love spirit moves through all thingsshimmy - 8/10 - okay , thps4 should 've picked prison songtoxicity - 9/10 - a good song to name the album off of , very dramaticpsycho - 10/10 - AHHH !!! i love this song so muchaerials - 10/10 - this song was the reason that i bought the cdi love how there is no swearing , makes me feel more comfortable when i 'm listening to it . i hope more albums like this .
 This CD is great , the best SOAD CD yet . The songs are pretty easy to play , but sound very good .
 System of a down had to pick up the torch as the next political band when Rage Against the Machine broke up , but they decided to steer away from that role . And on TOXICITY , they did that . This album has a lot of pure rock and roll rhythms and great guitar work by Daron Malakian . Sure , there are some political songs on this record , but PRISON SONG and SCIENCE are good songs even if it was n't political . But songs like PSYCHO and X show how fast and deranged they can get and then songs like CHOP SUEY and TOXICITY show how heavy they could get and then slow it down to make it work . This is one of my favorite records I have . if you 're just getting into System of a Down , HEAR THIS RECORD FIRST . Then if you like this record , you might want ot experience the hardness of System of a down 's self-titled record and their newest album STEAL THIS ALBUM ! -LRB- Great title huh ? -RRB- ENJOY THE SYSTEM AND ROCK ON
 I truly did n't know what I 'd been missing . From the opening notes of `` Prison Song '' to the spiraling `` Aerials '' and EVERY TRACK in between , `` TOXICITY '' has blown me away ! I 've found myself rather jaded lately , especially where new music is concerned , but System Of A Down have been my redemption . The sheer energy , raw power , blinding speed , shifting tempos and vocals courtesy of the Astounding Serj Tankian make this easily one of the most innovative and stunning heavy metal LP 's ever released . I could easily ramble on and on about the group 's political stance -LRB- they 're Armenian and have plenty to vent about -RRB- but since the brutal directness of Tankian and Guitarist Daron Malakian 's lyrics need no interpretation , I can just sit back and enjoy the dizzying ride . After the gorgeous ballad `` Spiders '' from their 1998 debut , I seriously wondered if these guys could top themselves , silly me ! The group blows away all doubt with the multi-layered , shapeshifting `` Chop Suey ! '' , probably their finest moment on record so far , though `` Jet Pilot '' is pretty darn close . `` TOXICITY '' is and endlessly fascinating listen .
 PRISON SONG - First song on a spectacular album . Great intro , great rhythm , weak lyrics . 8/10 . NEEDLES - Alright song , they really did n't put too much strong material at the beginning of this album . 8/10 . DEER DANCE - Excellent song . Great message and good chorus . Serj is really powerful here . 9/10 . JET PILOT - Probably a filler . This song is pretty much pointless but is fast and fun to listen to . 7/10 . X - Song about overpopulation . Not that interesting but again Serj is a great singer and System can make any song sound great because of their amazing musical ability . 7/10 . CHOP SUEY ! - First great song of the album . This is their first single , and is probably the mosh-pit anthem of the year . Such a cool song , even though it does n't make too much sence . I think this is System 's best song ever . 10/10 . BOUNCE - More of a comical song , one to let you catch your breath after Chop Suey ! Good fast music , alright song . 8/10 . FOREST - Average music , average lyrics , average song . 8/10 . ATWA - Slow song until the chorus , which is heavy . This is one of the best songs on the album . 9/10 . SCIENCE - Cool song and good lyrics and good music equals great song . 9/10 . SHIMMY - Really great song . It is a little short , but it was an experimental track for System and it turned out good . Actually one of my fav System songs ever . 10/10 . TOXICITY - Second single . Slow verses , faster chorus . This is a really deep song so you have to listen to the lyrics hard to understand whats going on . Excellent song . 10/10 . PSYCHO - Song about playing concerts and being on the road . Alright song but sweet chorus . 8/10 . AERIALS - Great way to end a great album . This is the third single off the album , and pretty much the only really slow song on the whole album . Great song though , makes my top five System songs . 10/10 . For any `` nu-metal '' fan , BUY THIS CD . Also a must have for any System fan , it is better than their first effort .
 System of a Down are one of the most original bands today . Go look for someone who sounds like them , I dare you ! You wo n't because no one does . Their sound is so unique it 's hard to explain . Serj 's vocals are very powerful , Daron 's guitar work is increadable -LRB- I think he 's one of the top three guitarist over the last five years -RRB- , Shavo 's bass is always pounding and John 's drumming is very good.Prison Song-THRASH !!! This song is thrash . All about the wrong doings of the leagle system . 5/5Needles-THRASH !!!! Yet another thrash like song . One of my favorites . Kind of funny , at first .5 / 5Deer Dance-THRASH !!! Here is some more nu-thrash -LRB- wow , that 's a good name for it , nu-thrash -RRB- . This song is one of my favorites as well . `` Behind the Staples Center you can see America ! '' 5/5Jet Pilot-Nu-thrash/death growls , amazing combination . I do n't know what it is , but I really like this song . The lyrics make no sence at all to me . 5/5X-Different than the last four , very Mid-Eastern , good . 4/5Chop Suey-If you hav n't heard this yet you 've been living under a large grey stone for the last two years ! Very good byt not the best . Very unthrash . 4/5Bounce-Nu-thrash/strange lyrics . That 's all I have to say . 5/5Forest-Here we leave nu-thrash behind us to move onto some more Mid-East stuff . Very tribal drumming , awsome . 5/5ATWA - Second slowest song on the whole album . Very cool lyrics . 5/5Science-Ramblings about how science `` has failed our mother Earth , '' cool ! 5/5Shimmy-Very fast song , strange lyrics , catchy . 4/5Toxicity-My favorite song on the album . Awsome drumming and guitar , very good lyrics . Very hard at the end . `` New what do you own the world ? How do you own disorder ? '' 7/5Psycho-Nu-thrash !!! Lyrics are quite strange , I think the guitar solo at the end is awsome ! 5/5Aerials-Another one you 've had to have heard if you watch MTV2 or Much Music . Slower song , kind of like ATWA . 5/5If you do n't own this CD yet , where have you been ? Go out and buy it know and speak the word of SOAD !!!
 Every so often , a music group explodes with such a different and solid style that just about everyone who listens to it happens to love it . System Of A Down is one of these groups , blowing up with their 2nd official CD , `` Toxicity '' . This CD is near-flawless all the way through and any fan of hard rock will fall in love with it quickly . The lead vocalist , Serj , has such a crazy sound to his voice that it really grapples you into the songs . All in all , SOAD is filled with very anti-regulation , rebellious , good hard music.The album starts out with a very hard song , `` Prison Song '' , which is sure to hit the listener hard with its lyrical content and sound . It 's a great introduction to most of the material we will be hearing later on the CD . Following the first song are two great ones , `` Needles '' and `` Deer Dance '' , both of which have hard choruses and flowing vocals by Serj . After these comes a pretty short song -LRB- barely over 2 minutes , but short songs are somewhat common to SOAD -RRB- but hard and fast . The drummer really kicks in and goes crazy on this song . Track 5 entitled `` X '' comes in a bit slower but just as solid as the rest ... then Serj goes very fast on most of the vocals . Next is the single track that really hooked me to SOAD 's newer sounding style -LRB- over their self-titled LP a few years back -RRB- , `` Chop Suey ! '' . This was a huge radio hit and is one of those songs that you love listening to even though it 's so mainstream . The vocals are really `` chopped '' up but all flow together , and the chorus is ... well ... `` heavenly '' I guess . Very angellic sounding , if that makes any sense . Awesome song.The 2nd Half of the album is just as good as the first . And truthfully that does not happen as often as it should in music these days . Track 7 , `` Bounce '' , follows Chop Suey ! up with a fast paced and * insane * song . Definitely the craziest on the album . `` Bounce , Pogo Pogo Pogo POGO !! '' . Good song . Following that is `` Forest '' , a semi-long song weighing in at 4:00 , but possibly one of my favorites . It has a medium paced beat going with it as Serj screams after every line . At track 12 , we come to `` Toxicity '' , the title track and very deserving of this title . Slower paced and more instrumental , this is one of my favorites . Psycho is a pretty dark song and very emotional , with a screaming memorable chorus , `` Psycho ... Cocaine ... Cocaine ... Crazy ! '' in increasing speed . A really good cut . And the final track
 I really doubted the SOAD could top their incredible self-titled debut , but they have ... and FAR surpassed expectations . This album is such an amazing accomplishment of modern metal that I find myself almost speechless . Serj Tankian is this generation 's Jello Biafra . His lyrics are pointed , political , and biting . He does not flich when giving his opinions , whether it be on the state of modern collegiate education -LRB- Shimmy -RRB- or the overcrowded penitentiary system of the USA -LRB- Prison Song -RRB- . As a whole work , Toxicity succeeds on EVERY level , the music is raw and hits you like a blast of adrenaline . The best thing about Toxicity is that it plays as a WHOLE album , something that is extremely rare in today 's watered down metal climate . Every track on this cd is strong , it is UNRELENTING and BRUTAL . Some of my very favorites are Jet Pilot , Prison Song , Forest , Aerials , and Toxicity . The song Toxicity anchors the album and is the absolute best thing that SOAD has done so far . Bringing in Rick Rubin was a great decision because the strengths of SOAD have been maximized -LRB- Tankian 's ranting , fast and numerous tempo changes , and Dean 's heavy riffing -RRB- and the weaknesses simply no longer exist . The track placement on Toxicity is to be commended as well and much credit should go to Rubin . I never thought I would say this but this album smokes TOOL 's LATERALUS by miles -LRB- and I 'm a huge TOOL fan -RRB- . Toxicity will hit you like a scud missile quick and deadly , but the remains will be with you for a lifetime . HiGhLy ReComMeNdEd .
 I loved System of a Down 's self titled debut , so naturally I was first in line to buy Toxicity the day it came out . After 3 years of delays and anticipation , I have to say I am not the least bit disappointed . Toxicity shows great growth in the band 's talent over the past few years , thanks to grueling touring and the union of SOAD with Producer-God Rick Rubin . The guitar parts are much more complicated and add more depth and personality to the songs . Add in Serj 's quirky vocals joined by Daron 's background vocals and you have a pretty unique album . The opening track `` Prison Song '' is more a comfort song than anything , telling the listener that System of a Down refuses to disappoint . Then tracks like Deer Dance and X get crazier and show that there is much diversity in this album , which ultimately makes it superior to their last outing . ATWA , a song based about Charles Manson -LRB- yes , you heard me -RRB- and his views on the environment is easily my favorite song on here . Very angry and very melodic at the same time . Aerials and Toxicity are two softer songs , which could be compared to SOAD 's own Spiders . Psycho is probably the most enjoyable song to sing along to and of course , you ca n't forget the first single , `` Chop Suey ! '' which is a great choice for a first single , and will definetly earn them the fame they deserve . If you loved System of a Down 's first album , you will love this even more . A great album , and I must say , it was well worth the wait .
 Many fans awaited this album with a single question in mind : Can SoaD possibly make an album better than their first ? Well , the answer has become blazingly clear-YES ! From the first jolting chord of `` Prison Song '' to the final whisper of `` Aerials '' it is quite obvious that you are n't dealing with a mere rock band , but a musical force to be reckoned with . So many young bands suffer the `` sophomore curse '' when it comes to following up a breathtaking debut , but SoaD has managed to outdo themselves and what a pleasure it is to listen to . Always the consummate showman , vocalist/lyricist , Serj Tankian is definately the biggest standout of the group . His voice has matured quite a bit since the first album , and this transformation is very apparent . His dynamic range can only be described as awe-inspiring . He infuses his lyrics with such emotion that the words take on a life of their own . I have read quite a few reviews that dismiss his unusual lyrics a simply psycho babble , but this could not be further from the truth . There tends to be a fair amount of symbolism in SoaD 's lyrics . If you simply take the words at face value all the time , of course some of it is n't going to make very much sense , but if you take your time to interpret the words for yourself , the meaning becomes very obvious . For example , `` Bounce '' may at first seem like a silly song about pogo sticks , but upon close listening , you 'll find that it is actually a song about a promiscuous woman . Guitarist Daron Malakian also stands out . In a way , he has the ability to produce music that is just a unusual as Tankian 's lyrics . He can go from heavy -LRB- `` Science '' -RRB- to beautifullly soft -LRB- the opening of `` Chop Suey ! '' -RRB- . He also displays a great vocal talent by lending harmonies to Tankian 's melodies on several tracks -LRB- `` Chop Suey ! '' `` ATWA '' `` Needles '' -RRB- . During the bridge of `` Needles '' he sings on his own , and the result is incredible . It seems that he has the ability to convey the few , and I emphasize few , emotions that Tankian can not achieve . Bassist Shavo Odadjian is definately a very talented bassist . He seems to to far more than just provide a foundation for everyone else to play upon . If you listen to `` Toxicity '' and concentrate on the bass , you will be pleasantly surprised . As far as lyrical content , `` Toxicity '' must be one of the most diverse in recent years . Their politically charged material has garnered comparisons to Rage Against the Machine , but I think these comparisons are a little off . SoaD can be very political at times -LRB- particularly on `` Prison Song '' `` Deer Dance '' and `` X '' -RRB- , but they can still have fun with a set of quirky lyrics -LRB- `` Shimmy '' `` Bounce '' -RRB- . With Tankian 's incredible vocal talent to work with , almost any type of song is possible . Despite the fact that this entire album is nearly flawless , a few tracks are bound to shine a little more than all the rest . `` Prison Song '' is a thought provoking criticism of the American prison system and its practices . The combination of a controversial topics and very catchy melodies seems to be the group 's forte . `` Deer Dance '' is another very political song that basically calls out the wrongs of the LAPD . The meaning of the song is n't always obvious , but the line that points a definite finger is the `` Beyond the Staples Center ... '' line . `` Jet Pilot '' just radiates the energy that SoaD possesses . The lightning speed and electric lyrical delivery in a way epitomizes what SoaD is all about . I have seen this song performed live and it is an incredible experience to witness . `` X '' , at least in my opinion , picks up where `` P.L.U.C.K. '' left off , telling the story of the Armenian Genocide . `` Chop Suey ! '' is a stroke of pure genius , and everyone already knows that , enough said . `` Forest '' is probably Tankian at his most dynamic . His voice goes from high to low , and soft to loud almost effortlessly and that makes this one of the best tracks on the album , which is a great complement when the excellence of the rest is put into consideration . `` ATWA '' is aesthetically the most beautiful song on the album . The intricate melding of Tankian 's melody with Malakian 's harmony envelopes this song in a sort of a melancholic beauty that is unlike anything you have ever heard . The title track is kind of ambiguously political . Rather than pointing out a specific entity that is being criticized like in `` Prison Song '' and `` Deer Dance '' , `` Toxicity '' just describes a situation and sort of lets you pick a specific on your own . My favorite track would probably have to be `` Psycho '' . To be very honest , the song is simply about cocaine crazed groupies , and is quite a harsh criticism of them . There is a bit of irony in this when you consider that rock bands and groupies basically go hand in hand . The opening of the song is this terrific guitar driven crescendo that ends with Tankian maniacally chanting the chorus of the song . That opening almost drags you into the song and does n't let go until the very end . Overall , `` Toxicity '' is a work of great minds and talent . It is clear exactly how much SoaD has expanded their musical horizons and have mastered their new styles incredibly . I think it would be safe to say that SoaD has their work cut out for them if they ever plan to top this !
 I had high hopes for this album and surprisingly System of a Downs sophmore release , `` Toxicity , '' does n't disappoint . I have been a fan of SoaD since their self-titled album . Although I loved that album there were some songs I just did n't care for and I found myself skipping 2 or so songs everytime I listened to it . This is not the case with `` Toxicity . '' Every song is awesome . From lead singer Serj Tankian 's rants about the U.S. prison system to the get up and dance song `` Bounce , '' in which he sings about a pogo stick . It 's interesting the way Serj 's voice and guitarist Daron Malakians voice seem to fit together in harmony . It just sounds so perfect . If you like System of a Down then your going to love this album . If you 've never heard System of a Down then chances are you 'll still love this album . Pick this one up before you pick up Slipknot 's `` Iowa , '' you wo n't regret it !
 Just as Id predicted , SOAD pulled no punches and released one of the years best records , while still maturing and growing upon their debut album . This was not an easy task-their s/t album was easily one of the greatest rock releases of 1998 . Toxicity takes everything that made that cd good and improves upon it-their unique blend of metal with Armenian influence has become tighter and even more focused . The songs sound even heavier and aggressive than some on the prior album , albeit with more melody . Unexpected time changes still come around with this band , leaving you guessing where it will go next . Songs are still politically charged , and the lyrics are at times bordering on the plain bizarre . The guitar work from Daron is great
 I have been looking forward to this album every since hearing their new single `` Chop Suey '' , the blend of acoustic and hammering drums and guitar riffs made it an immediate catch in my head . I also had been hearing a lot of buzz concerning this album 's release , which also helped to fuel my desire to purchase it as soon as possible . So when I got it I was expecting a lot out of the album . What I got was a remarkable piece of work that blew away my expectations.The album starts thumping with the heavy hitting , but very odd `` Prison Song '' , in which the vocalist changes voices several times and once sounds like a nasal Fred Durst . Then comes `` Needles '' and `` Deer Dance '' which both have thundering guitars and a very fast drum beat . They also both have beautiful if not odd vocals with amusing , but poignant lyrics . `` Jet Pilot '' starts out fast then slows down slightly , then picks it up again and continues this way until the end of the song . Has beautiful vocals though , probably one of the best tracks vocally . `` X '' is a heavy song , that starts out slow , then kicks into some super-high gear , with anthemic lyrics . Good song . `` Chop Suey '' is a very good song , great mix of speedy beats and acoustic sections . A beautiful song , believe it or not . `` Bounce '' is another fast song , but seems less serious than those before it , similar to `` Prison Song . '' Decent song , one of the weaker tracks . `` Forest '' does not have the punk beat , the earlier songs have , but is still a good song . Great vocals and lyrics , sounds similar to Tool . `` ATWA '' starts extremely slow , but kicks in during the `` I do n't feel it anymore '' , and repeats the cycle . Another excellent song vocally and lyrically . `` Science '' is a cool song that slows down in the middle , then the hammering guitars and drums kick back in with Serj 's anthemic vocals . The lyrics seem to convey that he believes religion over science . `` Shimmy '' is another odd song similar to `` Prison Song '' and `` Bounce '' , better than the latter . Cool lyrics make this a memorable song . `` Toxicity '' is a poignant song with powerful lyrics and pounding guitars . `` Psycho '' is melodic song that talks about cocaine adicts . One of the best tracks on the album . `` Aerials '' is a harmonious blend of stunning vocals and moving guitar work . The best song on the album , incredible lyrics , great way to end this brilliant album . After the song there is some odd tribal music , not really worth the time to listen to , though.As a band the musicians are top-notch creating beautiful metal riffs and punk beats . The lyrics are affecting and have great meanings , while Serj Tankian sings , rants , and screams beautifully his passions . These guys are similar in message to Rage Against the Machine , but have their own distinct style . Beautifully done , recommended for fans of Staind , Tool , Godsmack , etc. .
 I 'm not too impressed right now with the current state of hard rock . 95 % of today 's hard rock acts sucks because lyrically and musically they are cliched and contrived . This whole nu metal genre reminds me of when hair metal ruled the airwaves back in the early to late '80s . Then out of the sea of contrived and cliched rock bands that one rare band will stand apart from its peers with an album that shakes the foundations of hard rock . That band is System of a Down with it 's latest album `` Toxicity '' . I was n't immediately impressed with System of a Down when I first heard its first single `` Chop Suey '' . It was all noise and no substance to me but when I heard `` Toxicity '' , the gorgeous middle eastern melodies changed my attitude . I bought `` Toxicity '' through a record club so I could get more bang for my buck as opposed to paying close to $ 20 for one cd . I was greatly impressed with what I heard on `` Toxicity '' . I completely hear what many critics heard and why they listed that album as one of the best releases of 2001 . The lyrics may lean on the left side of politics which I do n't think is bad . It sure beats listening to the same ol' BS of `` life sucks '' from bands like Papa Roach and Slipknot . That old line is so cliched and contrived , not to mention lacks any imagination in songwriting . Musically , this album packs a real punch . Like I said before , I loved the middle eastern melodies that the band incorporated in the band 's music . That and their politically-charged lyrics are what set this band apart from their peers like Limp Bizkit and Slipknot . The title track and `` Chop Suey '' are just two of my favorite songs on this album . `` Prison Song '' kicked major butt as does `` Pyscho '' . I wish hard rock bands would follow System of a Down 's suit , not the ways of Limp Bizkit , Nickelback , and Puddle of Mudd .
 O.k. , I originally wrote System of a Down off as yet another wanna-be corporate Mtv `` nu-metal '' band . I WAS WRONG . THIS CD IS FANTASTIC ! Yes , I do think that SoaD should get down on their knees and worship at the feet of `` Faith No More '' -LRB- this CD brings `` King for a Day '' and `` Album of the Year '' to mind -RRB- , but they really have their own sound that comes out and distinguishes itself from other bands.I really liked their first CD , and on `` Toxicity '' the band is even more polished . The only song that does n't seem to fit on the CD for me is `` Chop Suey ! '' . It sound a little out of place compared to the other music , but that 's probably because I 've heard it on the radio so much . With good reason , it 's a great song!Anyway , the rest of the CD is a little heavier than the radio hit . I really like the lyrics . The lyrics of most of the songs talk about social or political injustices , like Rage . Unlike Rage , SOAD has a sense of humor and do n't seem to take up an issue with Everything.All in all , I think this CD is a safe buy . Metal friends of mine are split on their opinions of this CD . Some love it , some hate it . The odd singing and rapid time changes could definitely throw a listener off . I know this is often said , but I really believe that if you do n't like it at first listen , believe it or not `` Toxicity '' WILL grow on you . So will their first CD . If you like Faith No More , Korn , and Rage ; go ahead and experiment with System of a Down . If you can , see them live , too . Their energy could light the planet ! -LRB- Am I the only person who thinks that the lead singer of System looks like B-Real on a massive ammount of stimulants ? -RRB-
 Unless you have a grudge against political rock , I do n't see how anyone can trash this C.D. or say it 's overrated . This C.D. is one of my favorites and , in my opinion , was the second best C.D. of 2001 -LRB- second only to Tool 's `` Lateralus '' . -RRB- I would n't call it nu-metal -- sure , there are typically heavy riffs and drum beats , but the soulful vocals -LRB- sometimes soulful , granted they sometimes yell -RRB- and meaningful/thought-provoking lyrics make this more than nu-metal . I 'd call it intelligent metal . The lyrics are n't entirely political -LRB- although they often are -RRB- also deal drugs and groupies , and other issues -LRB- over population , and science failing `` mother earth '' -RRB- . Highlights include : `` Prison Song '' opens with a hard hitting riff which startled me at first . It then turns to chugging , machine gun riffs and drums , in between which singer Serj Tankien whispers `` they 're trying to build a prison . '' The song 's `` boom-boom '' riffs remain throughout the song while Serj 's angry voice sings Rage Against the Machine-esque paranoid lyrics about the government , prisons , and drug money . `` Needles '' is as heavy as `` Prison Song '' , but it has a dark theme and when guitarist Daron Malankian sings two minutes into the song -LRB- and Serj later joins him -RRB- , it turns melodic . It then turns to turns back to hard , chugging guitars while Serj alternates between almost soulful and yelling . `` Deer Dance '' is a personal favorite . The guitars are slower , but equally as heavy . Lyrically , it 's about crooked cops shooting little kids . My favorite part of this song is when Serj 's voice comes down after the chorus , he sings the following verse slowly -LRB- whispering at some points -RRB- until the build up of the next chorus . Here , you 'd think there 'd be a heavy break down , but Serj and Daron sing a capella for about two seconds . Then , the bone crunching riffs and yelling return to end the song . `` Jet Pilot '' is really fast with some good guitar work , but Serj 's nonsense lyrics -LRB- which I think are about war -RRB- drag this song down a bit . It sounds good , though.Surely , most of us know how good the hit single `` Chop Suey '' is . It 's brilliantly combines metal , melody , soulful vocals and thought provoking lyrics . You can put your own meaning to this song ; since it 's lyrics deal with religion -LRB- Jesus , angels and spirits -RRB- and suicide.I think `` Bounce '' is thrown in purely for mosh pit purposes . It 's not political , it 's just a fun song to listen to . The guitar chugs fast , and Serj sings a head banging chorus -LRB- `` Bounce ! Pogo , pogo , pogo , pogo ! '' -RRB- `` ATWA '' goes from slow verses to fast choruses , with great riffs . Serj shows his vocal range , here . `` Toxicity '' has great drum work -LRB- the best on the C.D. -RRB- with more irresistable riffs and deep , soulful vocals . `` Psycho '' builds slowly to another irresistable chorus that you 'll have in your head for days . The guitars and drums hit equally as heavy and simultaneously . `` Arials '' is , again , beautiful and heavy . Serj does some more real singing , in between the choruses -LRB- where his voice raises . -RRB- The lyrics , which compare life to a waterfall , are almost poetic . My favoirte part of this song , though , is at the very end of the song -LRB- when you think it 's over -RRB- . Here , an instrument that sounds like an Indian flute plays a solo for a few seconds , then is joined by soft drumming and chanting . Brilliant.So , this album is a masterpiece . Again , I would n't call it nu-metal , but I 'd recommend it to nu-metal fans , as well as Rage Against the Machine fans , fans of intelligent metal , melodic metal , and thoughtful lyrics .
 ALABAMA DOES GREAT `` SOUTHERN VIDEOS '' !!! This dvd contains 9 great videos by Alabama . Alabama is an inductee into the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville , I 've been there and I 've seen their plaque - it is well deserved . This dvd contains some great videos !!! They are as follows : Forty Hour Week -LRB- for a living -RRB- The Closer You GetMountain MusicThere 's No Way -LRB- There 's a -RRB- Fire in the NightDIXIELAND DELIGHTFeels so RightI 'm Not that Way AnymoreCa n't Keep a Good Man DownThese are some great videos to watch !!! Alabama is a great `` Southern Band '' . I enjoy watching these videos and I think you will too , and therefore , I highly recommend them !!! Thanks , and may God Bless !!!
 For anyone who loves Alabama , this is a must . Very , very good .
 Even though it is a music video collection it is Alabama at their best . I searched for concert dvd 's and found none but this is very good and allows me to hear and see them once again .
 The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because it is not a concert . I love concerts and this was about 9 music videos . However I enjoyed every song . Just was n't long enough . But worth the money spent . So I 'll go back and change my rating to 5 stars .
 Way too short . 37 minutes of videos , -LRB- though they are very good videos -RRB- , is not my idea of a DVD worth the money paid . How would it have hurt to add a couple of more songs to this ?
 If you want proof that George Strait has always been a first-class performer , here it is ... It 's kind of an odd package , though -- it 's a straight reissue , more or less , of three early albums , `` Right Or Wrong '' from 1983 , 1984 's `` Does Fort Worth Ever Cross Your Mind '' and `` Something Special , '' from 1985 . There are no added goodies -- it 's just one album per disc , with the original CD liner notes floating around loose inside the box ... No extra info , no new liner notes or booklet , nothing fancy , really , other than the hardshell cardboard case . You can still purchase these records individually , so I 'm not sure what this box adds , other than its physical solidity and gathering them all together in one place at one time . Either way , it 's nice stuff , some of the finest , sweetest popped-up honkytonk to ever make it outside of Texas.NOTE
 The other review was very helpful . I already own those albums.In fact I own just about ALL of his albums . He IS my favorite.For those that do n't have them - get them . Well worth the money.Enyoy ,
 After being profoundly disappointed in John Eliot Gardiner 's reading of BWV 147 , it is a great relief to find a period-style performance that entirely lacks the fussy , narcissistic mannerisms by which Sir John drains the spirituality out of Bach . He has a fine choir , but Suzuki 's is just as good , and this version of the famous ` Jesu Bleibet Meine Freude ' reminds us that it is possible to avoid Romantic anachronism without resorting to shallowness.These are fine , cultivated performances that amply convey the spiritual dimension as well as the energy and joy of two great works . Recommended warmly and without reservation .
 Bach
 The Belcea Quartet is one of the strongest of the relatively new chamber ensembles coming before the public today . Just a glance at the catalogue and the spectrum of music they tackle is impressive - Brahms , Schubert , Britten , Ades , Faure , Poulenc and now Ravel , Debussy and Dutilleux . They are an exciting ensemble.The performances here of both the well-known string quartets of Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel are clean , free of excessive emoting , and transparent in the best sense of the word . The phrasing continuity among the instruments is seamless and in the tutti sections the sound is sonorous and never pushed . These are both very fine performances.Added to this generous CD is the ` Ainsi la nuit ' by Henri Dutilleux , a work not known to this listener but one that begs re-hearing . The quartet writing is clever , innovative and never less than interesting . It does seem to go on a bit long -LRB- twelve movements -RRB- but it is well worth studying . Recommended Recording . Grady Harp , September 05
 I just heard this on XM Radio , and I 'm ordering it . I know the Ravel quartet very well , and I already have several recordings of it . But this was extraordinary . Technically perfect . Rich , mellow , and swinging . I never heard of this group before , but I will be looking for their other performances .
 `` The Real Folk Blues '' series , which saw releases featuring Sonny Boy , Howlin ' Wolf , John Lee Hooker , and Muddy Waters , was designed to attract young white blues fans to the Chess labels `` electric '' artists . There is nothing too folkish about these early-60s sides , and they are certainly no more `` country '' than Aleck `` Rice '' Miller 's other Chess waxings -LRB- all of which were band-backed and electric -RRB- , and while the MCA/Chess-compilations `` His Best '' and `` The Essential Sonny Boy Williamson '' remain the best career overviews , this one has a lot to offer as well , and a few of these songs do n't show up on either `` His Best '' or the `` Essential '' anthology . `` The Real Folk Blues '' opens with one of Rice Miller 's -LRB- Sonny Boy Williamson 's -RRB- best , toughest songs , the powerful , up-tempo `` One Way Out '' , followed by the equally magnificent `` Too Young To Die '' . Not all of these twelve songs maintain the incredible level of quality found on MCA 's main Sonny Boy-compilations , but even second-rate Rice Miller blows most other artists ' best efforts out of the water , and his way with words was unmatched . The ageing harpist is totally believable when he delivers the line `` When I first met you , little girl / I did n't know what I was doin ' / Now we 're all tied up / and my life is ruined '' in his raspy voice.Other highlights include `` Checkin ' Up On My Baby '' , one of Rice Miller 's finest songs , Willie Dixon 's `` Bring It On Home '' -LRB- later nicked by Led Zeppelin -RRB- , the irresistable , funky `` Peach Tree '' , and the morose `` Too Old To Think '' . This album is usually only available on a twofer-CD paired with its sister volume , `` More Real Folk Blues '' , but since that one is -LRB- almost -RRB- as great , you wo n't hear any complaints from me.Sonny Boy could always be counted on to deliver a slice of intelligent , tightly arranged , supremely confident electric blues of the highest order .
 When Sonny Boy Williamson strutted into Chess studios , Chicago , and the rest of the blues appreciating public were taken by storm.THis is a fine album by Sonny Boy and his Chicago rhythm section . `` Too Young To Die '' is a fearful song about a violent woman , `` Bring It On Home '' is a Willie Dixon chart topper , And `` One Way Out '' is a furious tune , written by Elmore James and Sonny Boy about a failed one night stand . `` Down Child '' is a Chicago-land classic.Excellent album . All but a few tracks are included on Chess ' `` The Essential Sonny Boy Williamson . ''
 Most of this is on the collections `` My Best '' and `` Essential , '' but one killer cut is not
 THIS IS CLIFTON CHENIER AT HIS BEST ON ACCORDION!HE MAKES NO MISTAKES AND WITH A GREAT BAND , HE DOES IT WELL . I LOVE THE BLUESY SONGS AND ALSO THE ZYDECO WALTZS . THIS CD HAS IT ALL ! FROM THE FIRST SONG TO THE LAST , ITS GREAT!EXCELLENT CHOICE FOR AN EARLY RECORDING OF THE MASTER CLIFTON CHENIER .
 Two of Johnny Cash 's oldest albums of which only Fabulous Johnny Cash has been available on CD until now . These are also two of the very few Johnny Cash albums that Columbia has released on CD - it would be great if they stopped making all these Best Of and Greatest Hits albums and started re-releasing the actual albums or let Bear Family make some more of the wonderful Man in Black boxes . This album includes some of songs which are also found on these Greatest Hits etc. . Songs like Do n't Take Your Guns to Town and Five Feet High and Rising . But it also includes a lot of songs which have never been released on CD -LRB- save for the Man in Black boxes -RRB- . With this CD you get two old albums and the original liners notes . And if you have n't got them on LP already you will hear a lot of new songs .
 I have NOT had my hearing checked , but to me this cd sounds WONDERFUL and o so romantic , i just love it . Am trying to learn Italien , and this cd sure has helped . No big investment - go ahead and get it , i am sure u wont be sorry -LRB- gr8 price for 3 cd 's -RRB- - yes indeed life is good !!!
 Soft Machine 's albums from THIRD -LRB- 1970 -RRB- through to SIX -LRB- 1973 -RRB- are of a transitional nature and see the band moving from psychedelia to fusion via avant garde and free form structures . 4 was originally released in February 1971 and continues where THIRD left off . It is the first Soft Machine album to be entirely instrumental . It is the last Soft Machine album to feature Robert Wyatt on drums and the first to feature Roy Babbington on bass -LRB- although he did not become an official member of the band until SEVEN -RRB- . Nick Evans -LRB- trombone -RRB- and Jimmy Hastings -LRB- alto flute , bass clarinet -RRB- also reappear from the THIRD line-up , and Marc Charig -LRB- cornet -RRB- and Alan Skidmore -LRB- tenor saxophone -RRB- make their debut . The standout tracks are those contributed by bassist Hugh Hopper . His four-part ` Virtually ' suite originally filled Side 2 of the album -LRB- tracks 4 to 7 on this CD -RRB- .5 , originally released in June 1972 continued the move towards jazz-rock . This album features Robert Wyatt 's successors on drums , Phil Howard and John Marshall . Elton Dean broadens his instrumental scope to include electric piano , as well as his favoured alto saxophone and saxello . Roy Babbington appears again on Side 2 of the original album -LRB- tracks 11 to 14 -RRB- . Howard drums on Side 1 -LRB- tracks 8 to 10 -RRB- and Marshall on Side 2 -LRB- tracks 11 to 14 -RRB- . Marshall 's performance is an ear-opening tour-de-force and gives hints of the band 's further steps towards fusion . He really makes you sit up and take notice after Howard 's performance . The best compositions this time around come from the pen of Mike Ratledge , and include the beautiful ` Drop ' -LRB- which features dripping water recorded excellently over the stereo picture
 Since their release in 1971 & 2 , 4 & 5 were my least favorite Softs , and for years I ignored them . Big mistake , but I was young . Then I found an Italian cassette compiliation with Teeth , put the tape into the car player and was blown away . I was finally ready for these demanding tunes.Most rock/pro/prog / jazz pieces that excite the listener do so through their spontaneity and energy . Classical compositions usually achieve their effect through structure and discipline . -LRB- There are many exceptions -- Robert Fripp , John Cage e.g. -- and of course all music worth hearing has some of both -RRB- . Teeth , though , achieves a perfect balance of form and freedom , measure and passion -- partly in Ratledge 's composition , partly in the superlative playing of the group . The other compositions on 4 are also _____ -LRB- does `` superlative '' have a superlative form ? -RRB- , though they tend a bit more toward order -LRB- Hopper 's tunes -RRB- or free-form -LRB- Dean 's -RRB- . 5 's also wonderful but a bit colder , anticipating the icily perfect surfaces of 6 . This review is awfully vague , but these albums are so musical that I feel like a pre-teen babbling in a Britney chat room when I try to describe them . So just buy the CD and play it a bunch so that it can get into your subconsciousness . Then dismiss my hyperbolic adolescent fawnings and put the CD in a time capsule . Listen to as much music as you can for a couple of decades . Finally , open the capsule and play Teeth . You 'll see what I mean .
 At times ripping deeper then most fusion jams ever dare go , the overall effects are again sometimes weighed down by the reluctant lulls of drugged out , less inspired distortionesque improv - even so , which is demonstrated with more eloquence then in future releases . With these two seminal albums fused together though , one can hardly pause from admiring the daunting collaborations each band member intuitively made in order to synchronize some of the most jazzily adept experimental rock music ever laid down . Some of it 's slower -LRB- free-form -RRB- parts may alienate the melodic minded , sober listener , although it would be a crime to not own this compilation if at all one is instrumentally inclined .
 This contains both Fourth and Fifth on 1 CD !!! And features all 3 Soft Machine drummers !!! -LRB- Robert Wyatt on Fourth and Phil Howard/John Marshall on 5 !!! -RRB- A great package !!! A +
 This collection features all of Soft Machine 's 4 & 5 albums . These albums are the band 's peak instramental recordings done in 70 through 72 . If you are not familiar with Soft Machine , get Vol 2 first , then make sure to get 3 , 4 & 5 , and 6 , then skip to Bundles . Great spin !
 Heiller is far better know as an organist , and as an organist of German music , especially Bach . But he was a mean harpsichordist as well . And of all composers for this strange instrument , Rameau is among the most prolific and tastiest . His La Poule is a famous piece , and this performance shows why.When looking at a reissue , among the most important considerations is how well remastered it is . Well , have no fears . Have no fear , said the Cat . The sound is immediate -LRB- sometimes a bit TOO immediate -RRB- and clear . Clean , fresh , and snappy , you can hear the clicks and pops of the instrument and the performer . Sounds great.My only caveat is that 51 minutes of unaccompanied harpsichord can be a bit much . But the playing is delightful , and full of smiles . Despite the somber picture of Anton Heiller on the sleeve . Good stuff .
 Speak and Spell is a great album with happy tunes like `` New Life '' and guilty pleasures such as `` Puppet . '' The band has admitted influence from Kraftwork , and this is obvious on tracks such as `` Tora ! Tora ! Tora ! '' and `` Photographic . '' One of the greatest things about this album is the variety of sounds included . The length of the CD is not predominantly somber or overly excited . Each track leads you into a different realm , and each transition flows smoothly . I only rated this album as a ' 4 ' however , because being a Depeche Mode fan for 15 + years , I can only tell you that their music gets better as time passes . Without the influence of Vince Clarke on subsequent albums , their sound slowly graduates into a soulful and insightful entity . If you enjoy music that walks the line between experimental and schizophrenic -LRB- NIN , Ladytron , Radiohead -RRB- , then be my guest and sample this record . But if you 're the type of person who likes to stick to top 40s , mainstream kind of music , `` Speak and Spell '' may not be for you .
 It 's a wonderful , full of great melodies album , that kickstarted two brilliant careers of ultratalented musicians
 This is Depeche Mode 's introductory album into the world of music and recording artists . A very pleasant and enjoying album to listen to contains one of the band 's best loved tracks by fans of all time , Just Ca n't Get Enough . Speak and Spell is more of a boing and bounce electronic type album in which is slightly different than the rest of the material the band would put out throughout their career . Never the less Speak and Spell clearly introduces the electronic style of music that would characterize Depeche Mode . At this time in the beginning of DM 's career Vince Clark from Erasure was a member and principle song writer for the group . His unique lyrics are pleasnt and interesting to listen to especially since most of the time they make no sense . The track Dreaming of Me is one of the highlights of this album with words that make no sense , but great chirpy and bouncy music that sounds as if you were watching a cartoon . When you come to the beautiful and subtle track of Any Second Now you are introduced to the heavenly voice of member Martin Gore who would become the group 's song writer following the departure of Vince Clark in 1982 . A good debut album from one of the best recording bands in music .
 I know it sounds a little cheesy now , but for the time , it was way kewl . Depeche Mode are pioneers of synth-pop , and have evolved into an underground sensation and beyond . My favorites are
 Yes , it 's a masterpiece . It 's just their debut but it already exceeds most of its successors -LRB- with the exception of Construction Time Again -RRB- . I do n't know why people always tell things like `` Good thing that Vince Clarke left so early '' and stuff , when he produced such a jewel of Britsh Synth Pop.We have these happy-go-lucky pop songs like `` Just Ca n't Get Enough '' or `` New Life '' , as well as thoughtful songs in minor key e.g. `` Puppets '' . And then , my 6 all time favourites , that are even better then various songs from other DM albums . `` Any Second Now -LRB- Voices -RRB- '' sounds a bit like Kraftwerk and it represents Vince 's sensitive side , letting Martin Gore take vocals and using the Warm Pad Synth in the -LRB- instrumental -RRB- chorus . `` I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead '' -LRB- which appears on this album version -RRB- might confuse the listener a bit , as the song is not at all as gloomy as the title would suggest . But nevertheless it 's great , due to the simplistic cadences -LRB- G-D-C -RRB- , this leading synth melody that reappaers constantly and the march feeling produced by the moog bass synth line and the militant rythm.Also the b-sides featured on this album version are great . Take `` Icemachine '' . It 's not that happy-go-lucky like its A-Side `` Dreaming of Me '' , but , written in minor key , darker and also rhythmically very interesting , using clapping percussion and puff sounds which make it seem quite rebellious.And then `` Shout '' is quite dark for Vince 's work and not at all naive and happy . It sounds a little bit exotic according to the heavy rythm devices , and this ` evil ' bass synths -LRB- modified with phaser effect -RRB- that dominates this track makes it quite dark so that the atmosphere of this song stands in contrast to its lyrics.Vince Clarke was a great musician but lyrically he was a little bit abstract . If you 're looking for proper lyrics on this album , you 'll only find them on `` Tora Tora Tora ! '' which was written by Martin Gore . And this song is also dark and sounds very exotic -LRB- Middle Eastern -RRB- , using various sounds effect and Drum Loops and a peculiar scale.So it 's clear that this song is one of my favourites . It was written by Martin but musically it 's still more similar to the true analog synth pop sound of the early eighties which , unfortunately , was resigned by DM after Vince 's departure in order to receive a different image . I wish , Martin had written more material with this early unique futuristic synth pop sound because `` Tora Tora Tora ! '' is so great.It 's only exceeded by `` Photographic '' . And this is the biggest killer they ever landed . Pure futuristic techno pop in minor key that surely influenced many artists of the later dance and techno scene . It was written in 1981 but sounds like from 1991 at least , already utilising that hard beat that would be etablished in Techno then.And , what makes it top , is the Sawtooth Synths in the Chorus and the Brass Synth Solo after the 2nd stanza.So these are my 6 favourites and it would be worth buying this album already for these six masterpieces that even differ from the ` usual ' Speak and Spell synth pop sound.But also the rest fits in and makes it valuable , and there 's no track that 's annoying like on other albums , even `` The Big Muff '' , an instrumental , is nice , but it would be recommendable to hear it as the intro song . And it would also be reommendable not to listen to the songs in the chronological order but in the order listed below , so that the 2 greatest songs come at the last :1 . Bug Muff , 2 . Any Second Now -LRB- Voices -RRB- , 3 . Just Ca n't Get Enough , 4 . Dreaming of Me , 5 . Icemachine , 6 . Shout , 7 . New Life , 8 . I Somethimes Wish I Was Dead , 9 . Puppets , 10 . Boys Say Go ! , 11 . Nodisco , 12 . What 's Your Name , 13 . Tora Tora Tora , 14 . PhotographicIf you take this order , it should be even more convincing and overwhelming.This album 's got something to offer for every mood.It contains bitterness , sometimes more subtle -LRB- Just Ca n't Get Enough -RRB- , and sometimes obvious -LRB- Tora Tora Tora -RRB- , romanticism -LRB- Dreaming of Me ; Any Second Now -RRB- and teenage rebellion -LRB- Icemachine ; Boys Say Go ! -RRB- . Vince harboured a certain intention writing these songs . And his lyrics are not always naive or happy-go-lucky , but also pure parody sometimes . He indirectly criticises the stupid monotonous night life -LRB- Nodisco -RRB- , makes fun of awkward macho behaviour -LRB- Boys Say Go ! ; What 's Your Name -RRB- , devolops ideas of Romanticism -LRB- Any Second Now ; Dreaming of Me -RRB- and Escapism -LRB- Shout -RRB- , is longing for a bit of command -LRB- Puppets -RRB- and even inserts the feelings of Loneliness , Nostalgia and Paranoia -LRB- Photographic ; Icemachine -RRB- . And Martin 's Tora Tora Tora is great anyway , also lyrically , criticising the cultural deprivation in the Middle East due to americanisation -LRB- how very current ! -RRB- So , for God 's sake , buy this album ! It 's a real masterpiece , totally under-rated . and you 'll never anything like that again , neither on Vince 's nor on DM 's later material . I hope that some artists of the current Synth Pop scene will be inspired to write such songs again , producing equally , if not better .
 I do n't know where else they have this edition , but it is the one to get , if you do n't want the CD/DVD edition of the record . I actually got mine at Best Buy , and for much cheaper than it 's sold on Amazon . I usually kind of cringe when people assume the guys are `` dance-pop , '' but this album is one where I can accept the label , as it is happy and boppy most of the way through . The lyrics are n't meant to be emotional or deep as they have been on later records , and some of it is downright silly.The hits `` New Life '' and `` Just Ca n't Get Enough '' are classics , from a time when Vince Clarke -LRB- later in Yazoo and Erasure -RRB- was the main song-writer . The former has a kind of Kraftwerk feel , but the vocals do n't sound like robots and it 's kind of a different league . `` JCGE '' has been on many soundtracks and ' 80 's compilations , and it 's as infectious as the title would imply . There 's two versions of the song . The original is the better one , but the Schizo Mix is fine too . -LRB- They both appear here . -RRB- Some of it is a guilty pleasure , like `` Boys Say Go ! '' has no depth and is possibly kind of embarassing , but it 's also catchy . Then some of it is so goofy you do n't know to take it seriously . Vince Clarke may have been gay , and `` What 's Your Name ? '' could have possibly refered to it , but with the `` P-R-E-double T Y '' part , it just loses anything worth taking seriously . Some of them were kind of more standard style , like `` Puppets , '' but that one was alright , too.It is n't perfect , as the instrumentals leave something to be desired , and `` Tora ! Tora ! Tora '' is n't quite as strong as later stuff Martin L. Gore would be known to write . But it 's worth having for four tracks unavailable on the U.S. standard edition
 Depeche Mode appeared on the world with `` Speak and Spell '' , their first album . The new romantic era has appeared , and Depeche Mode were the kings . On this album , there are good songs , like `` Dreaming of me '' and `` Tora Tora Tora '' . It also contains Depeche 's first classic
 Ive been a Depeche Mode fan for a while now , and I just listened to thier first album `` Speak and Spell '' and I must say , its pretty good.With the exception of `` Whats Your Name ? '' , all of the songs are pretty good . Vince was a OK writer , but he wasnt the best . Martin 's songs were good . I liked `` Tora ! Tora ! Tora ! '' and the instrumental `` Big Muff '' is pretty good . The Voices version of `` Any Second Now '' and the Schizo mix of `` Just Cant Get Enough '' are good , but I like the original versions of the songs better .
 I said earlier that I thought Clarke was singing Puppets and Photographic . Silly me , it was Dave Gahan all along . Vince did sing lead for the band in its very early days , however , prior to Gahan joining the band -LRB- at Vince 's request because he apparantly did n't care for singing too much -RRB- .
 the sound of this record is very particular , may be a little precarius , but you can see right there the talent and the sign of the band.this album is very enjoyable !
 Electronic power pop that sounds fresh to this day . The beats are more bubblegum punk than straight-up dance music . The songs have hooks the Archies would kill for
 Realmente estoy impresionado por las criticas de varios discos remasterizados de varios artistas , uno de ellos es de Depeche Mode , las quejas son absurdas , como por ejemplo por que no lo editaron en SACD o en CD , deberian hablar sobre la calidad del sonido . Aqui en Chile , los `` deluxe edition '' de Depeche Mode , aun no han sido editados debido a que solamente estan en PAL , y en Chile se usa formato NTSC.Un ejemplo , yo tengo las nuevas ediciones de `` Beggars banquet '' y `` Let it bleed '' de The Rolling Stones , son solamente ediciones DSD , pero encuentro un gran sonido y limpieza que resulta una belleza que se disfruta mucho mas de las antiguas ediciones . Hay algunos discos que se han editado en SACD y en esos casos , el sonido deja mucho que desear . Sobre Depeche Mode , pronto les hare una opinion sobre estas remasterizaciones , ya que desgraciadamente aun no los obtenido , bueno , en realidad no han llegado a Chile . Como dice Terence Reardon
 Eventhough Vince Clark sucks at writing some songs on this album , it is still one of my faves . If you 're a die hard Depeche Mode fan , this album is a must have .
 I 've just started listening to Depeche Mode not too long ago , and I fell in love with them instantly . Their music ranges from semi-religious to love to ideals . I love their music . The first song by Depeche Mode I ever heard was `` Strangelove '' and then `` Enjoy The Silence . '' All of their music is great and I end up loving all their songs , as opposed to buying an album to listen only to maybe one or two tracks . Their music can be soothing or upbeat . You can dance to it or relax . They 're a great band and I ca n't wait for their new album .
 Depeche Mode is one of the greastest bands out there , so any CD is worth buying !!
 Depeche Mode 's Speak & Spell , their first album . Showing their music roots in the most natural way , without influences , performing the best early synth-pop music from the 80 's with songs written by Vince Clarke -LRB- which left the band a little later -RRB- and Martin L. Gore.Two versions of this CD . This one -LRB- the import edition -RRB- featuring five extra tracks that the American Edition does not have . `` I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead '' , `` Ice Machine '' , `` Shout '' , `` Any Second Now '' and the Schizo Mix of `` Just Ca n't Get Enough '' are the extra tacks.I have both versions of this Album , and have to say that the import one sounds much better . Maybe the equalization was made from different tape sources.Also , the American version has the song `` Puppets '' which this import album does not.If you are a Depeche Mode Fan you would like to have that extra tracks on your collection . Songs like `` Ice Machine '' , `` Shout '' and `` I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead '' are hard to find on another Album or Single CD.Hope it helps you .
 If you first heard of Depeche Mode because of the `` Violator '' album , you 'd probably disagree with me . I myself picked up on Depeche Mode in 1987 because of `` Somebody . '' Before that I thought Depeche Mode was satanic . Now I listen to Frontline Assembly and Leather Strip a lot - how attitudes and tastes change!But despite changes over time , `` Speak and Spell '' by Depeche Mode is still one of those albums I love to play ! It 's odd , but even their ` minimalist ' techno pop has a lot more depth than most music today . And besides , who wants to be moody ALL the time ? Get over yourself ! `` Speak and Spell '' is pure fun and gets me bopping all over the room every time . I challenge anyone to sit still while listening to New Life , Dreaming Of Me , Boys Say Go ! and Just Ca n't Get Enough.For 1981 , this is a brilliant and superb album . To give Martin Gore credit , I still would probably rate `` Violator '' as Depeche Mode 's crowning achievement . However `` Speak and Spell '' comes right in the at a close second . To be honest , the rest of their albums had only shimmers of brilliance on them - these two had no failures at all.So if you love 80s pop , and are young enough to know and appreciate even what '80s pop ' even means , get this CD . Of course , why should I bother telling you that - if you fit that description , you 're sure to already have it . So why not go put it on already!As a side bar - Anyone know the name of that really cheesy teens-on-spring-break-overseas movie that came out in 81 or 82 that featured songs from `` Speak and Spell '' ? I have seen the movie ONCE , on a local UHF channel about 10 years ago . It shocked the hell out of me ! I 'm so proud -LRB- for some odd reason -RRB- to know this fact , but have yet to find the movie again .
 Although I 've listened to Depeche Mode since I was in junior high -LRB- Speak & Spell came out when I was in 3rd grade ! -RRB- , I would n't have called myself a fan until I bought Exciter a couple of months ago . I had also bought SOFAD and Ultra , and received some of the other albums as gifts , but it took the newest release to really initiate me into Mode Fandom . Now I 've given their past efforts another listen and really appreciate them a lot more.Speak and Spell sounds like someone got trigger happy with that cheap electronic keyboard you got for your 13th birthday , the one that came with all the preprogrammed samples and cruddy drum loops . You know the one I mean . It 's cheesy , it 's simplistic , sometimes it makes you laugh out loud . So why did I give it four stars ? Several reasons : First , the earnestness of these then-young musicians just comes through so clearly in each of these songs . I can probably count on one hand the number of times I 've listened to some new band 's CD and thought , `` Wow , these people really sound like their hearts are in it , and they 're just happy to be making music . '' Usually I hear a new band 's CD and think , `` Wow , their producer really knows how to cash in on a trend ! '' That 's not the case with Speak & Spell and it 's very refreshing . Also , it 's a little piece of history , not just to nostalgic Mode fans but to anyone with an interest in tracing the development of popular music over the past 20 years . DM 's albums provide an interesting look at the past two decades of music and they 're one of the few bands who 've stayed relevant enough and steadily prolific enough to be able to do that . Finally , it 's oddly inspirational to hear this earnest albeit cheesy and simplistic album and then listen to something as sophisticated and mature as Exciter . It gives me hope that one day I 'll be a grown-up , too . ; - -RRB-
 I 've had the American release of Speak & Spell forever now , and I 've always thought it was an incredible album . What bugged me , though , was that it only had the junk `` Schizo Mix '' of `` Just Ca n't Get Enough , '' and not even the original mix , which , IMHO , is much more fun and upbeat.Then I found this import '' +5 '' version , and I was stunned -- not only are both versions of JCGE on here , but there are also 4 other tracks which do n't appear on the American release . And they 're all really good -- no filler here ! The import '' +5 '' release also has better sound quality across the board.A warning , though
 This is the version of Speak and Spell to own . It has great bonus tracks -LRB- mostly b-sides of singles taken from the album -RRB- plus the inclusion of Sometimes I Wish I Was Dead -LRB- which Sire/Warner Brothers in the felt the need to delete from the US pressing of this album . -RRB- Great synth-pop . Silly lyrics . Total ear candy .
 Depeche Mode 's premier album was the start of both DM 's career , and Vince Clarke 's -LRB- later to form `` The Assembly '' , `` Yaz -LRB- oo -RRB- '' , and finally `` Erasure '' -RRB- . The seeds for both stem right here.From the opening `` New Life , '' we get an upbeat tune , very different from where DM is right now . `` I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead '' is a title that infers an ultimately depressing song , but like Vince 's later `` Oh L'Amour '' , its another popy upbeat song , with lyrics that narrowly contradict the music.Most of the album carries on with even more catchy tunes provided by Vince Clarke , the master of synth , but , we also get to see the stems of modern Depeche Mode . Although most of the tracks were written by Vince Clarke , DM 's current songwriter , Martin Gore , gets two shots off in this one , and at this early stage , its hit and miss . `` Tora!Tora!Tora ! '' easily shows us where Depeche Mode would go with Gore at the helm . The lyrics in this song are noticably darker than those by Vince , and the music has a much different sound than those by Vince . `` Big Muff '' is Gore 's miss . A drab song by comparison , its nothing really special and probably the only song I do n't play to death.Finally , `` Just Ca n't Get Enough '' . This is the song that cemented Depeche Mode 's career . Vince Clarke/Depeche Mode 's first hit , this song was performed at the 101 concert , long after Clarke left the group and is one of the classics that personified the 80 's . I will end this with some quick advice , if at all possible , get the UK version of this album . It includes 5 extra tracks ,11 -RRB- Dreaming of Me12 -RRB- Ice Machine13 -RRB- Shout14 -RRB- Any Second Now15 -RRB- Just Ca n't Get Enough -LRB- schizo mix -RRB-
 Yes , yes ... this is not the amazing Gothy , darker Depeche that we all know and love today . But it IS a perfect set of synth-laden pop tunes that was quite groundbreaking in its day . Really good songwriting ... and it paves the way for the work Vince Clarke would go on to do in Erasure . If you love the New Wave sound of the early '80s , you 've got to get this one .
 I suggest owning both this version and the US version -LRB- for the die hard fans of course -RRB- . Some songs that are on both versions are different versions , so it 's a treat to own both .
 I am 26 years old and I have been a fan of Depeche Mode since I was about 10 years old . I remember listening to this tape with my sister in her room and thinking how great this band is . I still love their music . I listen to them every day . I have all their CDs and I got to see them in concert during there Exciter tour . I guarantee that you will fall in love with Depeche Mode and appreciate their talents and Martin Gore 's song writing skills .
 This is the only Depeche Mode album I own . Why?One , because it 's fun , catchy stuff , and , despite its bubble-gum aura , if you listen closely you see some really interesting production going on by Vince Clark . Turn up the bass , and the songs suddenly become more serious and less bubble-gum once the beat gets thumping . Lyrics ? Personally , I do n't care.Two , because , IMHO , after this album Depeche Mode went downhill in a MAJOR way . They tried so hard to be `` cool '' and `` deep '' that much of their music just got boring , and , paradoxically , lost its soul.Some tracks on this album do n't do it for me , but there are so many gems -LRB- e.g. New Life , Dreaming of Me , Just Ca n't Get Enough , Tora ! Tora ! Tora ! -RRB- that I consider it a must-have . I have to agree with J.Brady above that if you 're going to buy this , you MUST get the import . The import has everything on the American release plus 5 extra tracks , most of which are great . The import has better sound quality to boot . But most importantly , the import has both versions of `` Just Ca n't Get Enough , '' whereas the American release only has the junk Schizo Mix.A warning , though , for die-hard DM collectors
 So this is where it all began . Speak and Spell certainly has a lot a really good material , mixed with some fairly embarrassing songs . Naggingly tedious tracks like ` Boys Say Go ' and ` What 's Your Name ? ' , as well as the boys ' attire in the ` Just Ca n't Get Enough ' video , gave a -LRB- possibly ?? -RRB- misleading impression that Depeche Mode were an openly gay synth group . It must have just been a phase ... Aside from the aforementioned songs , there were elements of the dark edge that Martin Gore would hone when he became chief song writer after Vince Clark 's departure . This darker and whispered rendition of ` Photographic ' is far more satisfying than the earlier schizo-disco version released on the Some Bizzare compilation album . ` Puppets ' is another along the same dark sound , but retains and attractive melody.Bridging both worlds is the excellent ` Nodisco ' . Some of the the aggressively bouncy tracks have retained appeal over these years , including the big hit ` New Life ' , as well as the misleadingly titled ' I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead ' . That song is full of twee keyboards with no talk of death , and may have been an in-joke contradiction between song and title.And I have to say that I just CAN get enough of ` Just Ca n't Get Enough ' . I can not stand this song in any manner , and it 's does not deserve the longevity that it has received . Awful , simply awful.A couple of the best songs from this period were left for B sides , and stuck on the DVD . ` Ice Machine ' may be my favorite song from this era , but ` Shout ' comes close.The remastering on this CD is excellent . It is not too loud or compressed , and had not been tweaked in any way that causes unwanted results . An excellent sounding product .
 I agree with robertogt . This is worth the extra money . The U.S. version pales in comparison . I had that on tape , but I 'm donating it to the library . If only Reprise would release it like this here . Now I just have to get `` 101 '' on DD and a few others on my wish list.Released in Australasia by Liberation/Festival-Mushroom .
 I purchase this album only to complete all Documental parts of the remastered collection . Becose I have the old album and is very interesting see Vice talk about DM , since leave the band . And now a possible new Bare-version release of a secret song called `` SONG OF ROSE '' or `` TEARS OF ROSES '' . B side of Speak & Spell written by Vice & Martin with AWESOME RUMBLING GUITARS OF BOTH !! Please DM release this track soon !!
 Such a long history , and this is where it all started . Amazing . . total ear candy . And the extra tracks ... oh yes . . 100 % worth it . Is there anyone that does n't already own this ?
 One of there best albums ever including hits like `` I Just Ca n't Get Enough '' and `` Dreaming of Me ''
 For those of you not in the know , David Gathan does not playing any of the old Depeche Mode songs . So very sad for us die hard fans . Albums like Speak and Spell , A Broken Frame , Construction Time Again , People are People , Black Celebration are the true Depeche Mode I know and love before they got over popular with Music for the Masses , SOFAD , etc. . Its the early albums like these you can really feel some of the raw untamed energy the band really had . Thankfully , I still have a new album to look forward to from Martin Gore ! Oh how I miss these songs !!!
 `` Speak and Spell '' is an early synth pop classic . Released in 1981 , it 's a wonderful mix of Vince Clarke 's catchy melodies and fat analogue sounds . Clarke of course would leave the group after the album to form Yaz and then Erasure . I would recommend buying the import version if possible since it includes the wonderful b-side Shout ! -LRB- perhaps the darkest song Vince has written -RRB- and I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead which provides a sugary high few other songs have ever achieved.Newer fans of DM may not like this as it sounds almost like an entirely different group compared to the present Mode . But if you 're of a lover of synth-pop and/or 80 's music , this is a must have .
 I got this album as a used record the other day just for fun , and now I expect I 'm going to have to buy the CD anyway . Instantly recognizable as the work of Vince Clarke , master of the catchy pop tune and the cheesy lyric , there 's not a weak point on this album . Side one has my favorite , `` New Life '' along with another single , `` Dreaming of Me '' , and a few other songs you ca n't help but laugh along with . Side two shows shades of what is to come with a couple of tracks by Martin Gore , including my favorite DM instrumental of all time , `` Big Muff '' . Even the tunes penned by Clarke are a little darker than usual on side two , including the extended mix of the smash single , `` Just Ca n't Get Enough '' .
 I love this album . It has most of the classic Depeche Mode that you will all remember ...
 That 's because Rhino is now owned by the WEA group and they do n't support SACD . They could have used DVD-Audio instead , considering all the trouble they went to creating surround versions . The DTS 96/24 tracks are decent IF you have a newer 96/24 DTS decoder , otherwise you 'll get 48/24 output . This same problem will plague the upcoming Genesis reissues as well , you 'll only get the SACD layer if you buy the import and that means the videos will be PAL format .
 I could n't ask for better sound and care for the album 's restoration and re-release . If you 've got the original CD edition , this remaster necessitates a repurchase . If you 're a newcomer , SPEAK & SPELL is a real treat , displaying a young and perhaps naive Depeche Mode , with Vince Clarke as their main songwriter . A very memorable and trendsetting album . The bonus DVD 's documentary is also first-rate .
 I recently bought this CD for a little trip down memory lane -LRB- I had it on vinyl back in the 80s -RRB- . It 's a fun bit of history , though some of the songs are almost unlistenable nowadays because they are so incredibly cheesy and low-tech techno.Some of the songs still strike me as very good , minimalist techno -- for instance , `` Nodisco , '' `` Tora ! Tora ! Tora ! '' and `` Puppets . '' But other , more fluffy-pop songs , like `` Dreaming of Me '' and `` What 's Your Name ? '' are almost embarrassing to listen to now -LRB- even by myself ! -RRB- . Still , it 's a unique recording , and it 's interesting to see how much DM has changed over the years . You just might find yourself skipping past some of the songs -LRB- much easier on CD than vinyl , thankfully -RRB- .
 This CD has a pretty good selection of tracks on it . That 's just my opinion , though , because I am more for the early work of DM than the newer darker stuff . Puppets , Boys Say Go ! , and Nodisco have basically the same melody line . Go figure .1 . New Life - Nice bouncy track . Second strongest song on the album . 5/52 . Puppets - This gives a concept of a person who controls another person 's life . Weird . Gore sings . 4/53 . Dreaming of Me - This song is the strongest on the album . No wonder it 's a single . Strong beat , bubblegum flavored . 5/54 . Boys Say Go ! - Basically just another early DM song . It 's got a normal rythm for this period . 3/55 . Nodisco - A song that is just ... hmm , let 's move on . 2/56 . What 's Your Name ? - A happy song ?!? What ? The exact opposite of later DM songs . Gahan and Gore sing . 3/57 . Photographic - Here it starts . It was the first song they did under the name Depeche Mode . The Some Bizarre version was better . It leans more into their darker face , but is still decked out with a fast rhythm and countless synthesizers . Gore sings . 4/58 . Tora ! Tora ! Tora ! - The weakest on the album , I do n't listen to it much . 1/59 . Big Muff - `` Popcorn '' for the '80s . Instrumental with lots of synthesized SFX . 4/510 . Any Second Now -LRB- Voices -RRB- - It 's a strange one . It really does n't have a point . Dark . 3/511 . Just Ca n't Get Enough - It is a great listen . It 's got a good rhythm , great vocals by Gahan , and an overall wonderful feel to it . 5/5
 Have a cup of coffee , watch the world go by , and enjoy the tunes with this cd . They were the `` new ones '' you know.It 's sparks art . How can you deny this listeners ?
 do n't listen to the naysayers . the U.S. reisssue of ` speak and spell ' is a more than worthy addition to the dm reissue canon . chances are you already own ` speak and spell , ' as well as it 's great b-sides , ` ice machine , ' ' i sometimes wish i was dead , ' and ` shout , ' so i wo n't get into the album itself.the accompanying dvd is a veritable treasure trove for mode-a-philes , the most shiniest diamond being the interviews with vince clarke . i do n't know much about vince 's personal feelings about dm , but if he harbors any grudge , it certainly does n't show . and it was nice to hear the man actually speak . it 's a nice treat . it was also so great to hear the stories behind the early mode gigs , how daniel miller first decided to sign the band , how seymour stein flew to basildon to see them live , how they recorded the album , the genesis of the hideous album cover , and the truly embarrassing , but endearing and charming , early live performances on TOTP and other british tv shows . dave looks like he 's about 14 years old . he comes of as shy and naive -- a far cry from the dave we 'd see but 10 years later . vince seemed in command from the beginning , martin seems confused and fletch , well , he 's fletch.as with the violator and masses reissues , the mixing sounds great . i picked up a lot of bells and whistles in the songs i 'd previously missed . i only wish they would 've included the b-sides on the cd , or as a bonus cd .
 of course ` speak and spell ' sounds cheesy in 2005 . it 's 25 years old and any fair assestment/critique of ` speak and spell ' needs to examine when it was recorded and released . in 1981 synthesizer music technology was still very much in its embryonic state . Very few bands -LRB- kraftwerk , human league , OMD , depeche mode , among other -RRB- used synths and even fewer knew how to harness the technology . i imagine programming synths was a lot like building rocket ships -- lots of trial and error , some hits , some misses.it should come as little suprise , then , that ` speak and spell ' is a bit simplistic and cheesy . what 's impressive about ` speak and spell , ' however , are the absolutely phenomenal melodies vince clark composed . one listen to ` just ca n't get enough ' and its permanently engravaed into your brain . and since it was vince clarke 's album , it bears hardly and resemblence to the latter martin gore dm albums -LRB- the exception being ` photographic ' and ` puppets ' -- both a bit darken in tone -RRB- . its easy to forgive vince for ` what 's your name ? ' when he wrote such classic dm songs as ` new life , ' ` dreaming of me , ' and the aforementioned ` photographic ' and ` just ca n't get enough . ` what 's special about ` speak and spell ' are the classic dm synth intros -- most of the songs have a synth intro . ` just ca n't get enough ' and ` new life ' are prime examples of a new style of songwriting . vince did n't waste time with the hook coming in the middle of the song or the verse or a bridge . the hooks were front and center , immediate attention grabbers . in that way , vince single-handedly changed pop songwriting.if you do invest in ` speak and spell , ' be sure to get the import version . several essential dm cuts are n't found on the US release , namely
 Depeche Mode 's first album , Speak & Spell , is here now in remastered format and has warmer synths , crisper vocals , and fatter drums that brings the futurist \ synth-pop classic to the 21st century . Several tracks that stand out are Photographic , Nodisco , New Life -LRB- Presented here in the original version and not the remix like on previous US versions of Speak & Spell -RRB- , and Just Ca n't Get Enough , but all in all the entire album sounds great . The second disc , a DVD which includes a 5.1 version of the album , b-sides from the singles from the album , and a 30 minute documentary with rare footage of the band and interviews with everyone from Vince Clarke to Daniel Miller.There is no reason to give this album bad reviews based on minor techinal details . The songs are great like before and the album sounds better than it ever has . Well worth it to fans of Depeche Mode .
 First of all , I have been a fan of this album since the 80 's , and this is definitely the version to own . The only problem is this is NOT remastered . It is the same import disc that has been available since 1988 . I re-purchased it thinking it was an improved version , but it is only a re-release . The bonus tracks are great , and one of them is only available on this edition -LRB- `` I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead '' -RRB- . The other four are available on three American CD singles -LRB- Dreaming of Me , New Life , and I Just Ca n't Get Enough -RRB- . If you do n't own the album , buy this disc . If you own the American version but want the bonus tracks , buy this disc . But if you have imported this disc in the past DO NOT re-buy it . You are getting nothing new for your money .
 Admittedly , this album is , superficially speaking , differently sounding than the rest of their -LRB- later -RRB- material . But make no mistake
 Speak & Spell , the work of keyboardist , Vincent Clarke -LRB- who I 've followed throughout his 20 year career with Depeche Mode , Yaz , and Erasure -RRB- is oddly cheesy , yet cool at the same time . It 's obvious when listening to the music that the Depeche Mode band members were just beginning their careers - the lyrics are pretty cheesy and the songs are kind of weird and silly - but notwithstanding , the melodies , though generally simple , are funky and cool as are the synthesizer tones that Clarke employs . In fact , for a number of reasons , this is one of my favorite Depeche Mode albums . Although , Clarke has come a LONG ways since Speak & Spell -LRB- in the right direction -RRB- , I still consider this album one of the cooler 80 's synthesizer pop albums to have ever been developed .
 Now do n't get me wrong , this album does n't come close to Black Celebration -LRB- 1986 -RRB- , but it is still a classic . Although Martin Gore did n't write more than 2 songs on the album -LRB- one of them does n't even have lyrics , what a shame -RRB- , its still a fun upbeat early 80 's album . I love synth-pop , and like most synth-pop fans , I love the cheesy , simple synths and drum machine sounds . Vince Clarke does an OK job with the lyrics here , well it * was * 1981 , what would you expect ? Tracks 1-2 , 4-12 are available on the standard US version of this album , for a great review of those songs check out the Amazon user comments for Speak & Spell -LRB- US -RRB- . Now , as for the `` extra tracks '' , I got this CD because I really ... really ... wanted those extra tracks . I paid a bit more for the import CD , and it was worth it for me . The extra songs wo n't change your view of the album or Depeche Mode.Dreaming of Me is n't really that much of an extra track . It is already available on the US version of the album . But in the import version , it does count as an extra track because the UK version has the song `` I sometimes wish I was dead '' rather than Dreaming of Me . `` ISWIWD '' is included on this import . The song is the standard DM early song . synths , drum machines , although it does have an edgier side -LRB- well , more edgier than `` What 's your name ? '' -RRB- But I do n't know what DM were thinking ! `` New Life '' and `` ISWIWD '' on the same album ? 2 tracks away from each other ? Not too consistent ! But once again , it * was * 1981 * and * their first album , and for a first album , it is pretty good.Ice Machine would probably be the only one that really stands out as a `` bonus '' . It has a catchy synth-pop style sound with the traditional early 80 's Depeche Mode lyrics . Although if you ever come across the live version , you must listen to it , its an amazing song performed live.Shout is a mediocre b-side to a not so mediocre single `` New Life '' . I 'm sure the song would be much better if the producer would have just amplified Dave Gahan 's voice a bit during production ! You can hardly hear the lyrics and the background music overpowers his voice . Its a traditional early 80 's synth-pop song , but if only the voice of Gahan was louder , the song would be a little less forgettable . Once again , the live version of this song -LRB- also rare -RRB- is done quite well -LRB- maybe because you can actually hear the words ! and its mixed quite well -RRB- . Any Second Now , is a good example of an early Depeche Mode ballad . The lyrics are ok , but it has a certain sense of ambience that was not common in early 80 's synth-pop . The song is already included on the standard version of Speak & Spell , so buying the import for this song is not necessary . Although the import contains an instrumental version of the song ... nothing extraordinary just the song with no lyrics.Just Ca n't Get Enough -LRB- Shizo Mix -RRB- ... wow , a 3 hour version of `` Just Ca n't Get Enough '' ... I have n't been that bored since `` Titanic '' ! Seriously though , the 6 -LRB- some odd minute -RRB- version of this classic gets a bit boring at times , and makes you glad you can fast forward so easily with CD 's . Although it does have its moments , its basically the 12 '' version of the song.I would have enjoyed having other early DM `` bonus tracks '' on this import . For example the song `` Television Set '' -LRB- which is currently only available in a hard to find live version -RRB- would have been a good addition to this album . Well , here is my verdict , if you are a hardcore DM fan , go for this album , it will complete your early collection of DM works . If you 're a so-so fan , the regular US version of this album will suffice . If you are none of the above , get the 81-85 Singles collection , it will give you the stand out cuts -LRB- by that I mean the `` hits '' -RRB- from this album . Unless your a big fan , this import wo n't mean much to you -LRB- like many imports are -RRB- .
 The Package.Double digipack containing a remastered Audio CD , and a DVD with remastered stereo , 5.1 , and DTS versions of the album . The DVD also contains the extra tracks and a half-hour `` documentary '' . The Good.The documentary is a great bonus.The remastered CD is better than the original CD release , albeit only marginally.It is very interesting to hear the DTS versions because you can pick up a lot you never heard in the original stereo versions . Tracks are nice and crystal clear , and also slightly different from the originals , and not just because of the DTS . The vocals are very clear and for once it is easy to understand the lyrics.The Bad.Why does the CD not contain the extra tracks ? This is completely bizarre!The DTS versions are not very well done . The drums sound puny compared to the originals and are very watered-down on several tracks . New Life is particularly weak . It 's difficult to describe but you will hear it instantly - the `` clap '' sound present in most of the original snares is very distant or non-existant , so it 's quite strange to hear this . Some FX seem to have been stripped from or modified in certain sounds and , while interesting , detracts from the enjoyment - I find myself thinking `` it 's not supposed to sound like that '' . This is especially true in sounds where reverb seems to have been lowered considerably.If I had the choice over again , I 'm not sure I would have paid the $ 23 for this package . The Audio CD could have been remastered a lot better and should have included all the b-sides and extra tracks - try getting them from the DVD onto your iPod !! Also , how about some other studio tracks from around the same time as extras - Television Set , Reason Man , I Like It ... etc. . This alone would make it worthy of being called a `` Deluxe '' edition .
 Depeche Mode 's Speak & Spell , their first album . Showing their music roots in the most natural way , without influences , performing the best early synth-pop music from the 80 's with songs written by Vince Clarke -LRB- which left the band a little later -RRB- and Martin L. Gore.Two versions of this CD . This one -LRB- the import edition -RRB- featuring five extra tracks that the American Edition does not have . `` I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead '' , `` Ice Machine '' , `` Shout '' , `` Any Second Now '' and the Schizo Mix of `` Just Ca n't Get Enough '' are the extra tacks.I have both versions of this Album , and have to say that the import one sounds much better . Maybe the equalization was made from different tape sources.Also , the American version has the song `` Puppets '' which this import album does not.If you are a Depeche Mode Fan you would like to have that extra tracks on your collection . Songs like `` Ice Machine '' , `` Shout '' and `` I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead '' are hard to find on another Album or Single CD.Hope it helps you .
 You cant go wrong with this classic . I beleive most people know what they are in for when they are buying a classic like this . .
 I love this album because I 'm a real Vince Clarke fan and when I found out that it was available in SACD format I had to have it . Now if your an audiophile like me and you would like the SACD version you have to get the British import of the Deluxe Edition , but here 's the catch , not all import Deluxe Edition 's are SACD . -LRB- I went through about 3 of these until I found one -RRB- The SACD logo will be on the back of the CD box if it is an SACD . The SACD sounds great -LRB- comparable to the 5.1 mixes on the DVD -RRB- The biggest surprise is during the song `` I just ca n't get enough '' where the chorus appears in the back of the room ! as well as more surprises in store for you.Enjoy !
 I 'm very satisfied with order , it cameqiute in time , the only thing our post office was n't working well , so as present it came too late , but any way , rare thing in our country and amazon way best answer .
 Except for What 's Your Name , which is quite awful , this is a great record . It 's simple , light , and rather comically gay-tinged , even though the lineup is all heterosexual . One can even see the leather bar look the band had on YouTube . I second the reviewer who said seek out the version that comes with the b-sides . This record shows bubble gum pop done right , unlike A Broken Frame . I 'm not sure about the extended Just Ca n't Get Enough . Maybe that 's something that was added later because I recall my tape had the regular version .
 I love this cd . It is one of my favorite Depeche Mode albums . If you are a Depeche Mode fan , you must own Speak and Spell for your collection . You will not regret it .
 Even there is a long time from this first work , its always nice look back and listen whats would be the start for this wonderful team of boys and company like mute , bringing us for the last 25 years with excelent musicTo watch some images from that time and the way they get trought from basildon to the world its something you have to do , in order to fully understand about the great contribution this band have made to the music around the world
 This remastered ultimate special edition is a great buy . I find Depeche Mode to be one of my favorite bands and cd 's like this bolster that point of view with greater intensity . The sound quality of the remastering and the addition of songs that some people may have never heard are fantastic ! Plus , the dvd of interviews and past performances on tv shows and such is amusing , it 's great to see how the guys were at different points in their career . If you enjoy this one the other remasters are just as fun with the same set of features such as extra songs and dvd documentaries . I highly recommend this and the other remaster !
 This was depeche mode 's first release and sounds quite different from their later recordings of course . This is a great start for anyone new to DM , This also comes with some intresting facts about DM 's upbbringing . BUY IT
 Navah Perlman is a great artist in her own right . Although she is the daughter of one of the century 's premier violinists , Ms. Perlman appears to possess an even greater artistic insight into the music she performs . The Bach is full of fire and delicacy with the voices clearly delineated . The Beethoven sonata opus 109 can stand comparison with the best including Myra Hess ' legendary performace . Her Chopin is poetic with beautiful singing tone and her Mendelsohn is brilliant . The Prokofief shows her talent for modern masters . All told a most impressive debut -- She should have a brilliant career
 I just heard Navah Perlman perform in Washington DC and she was so awesome that I had to check out her CD . It is great . Her performance , both live and on the CD , really moved me . I stongly recommend the CD -LRB- especially the Chopin ! -RRB- .
 Just picked up this CD - it is wonderful . The selections are ones I will love to listen to over and over and I am so impressed with the quality of musicianship . I hope to hear more from her soon !
 This is a great album that deserves wider recognition . I must say , however , that Joe 's earlier releases on the Fania label from 1967-72 are even better
 Imagine . It 's 1972 an you 're strolling -LRB- or sneaking -RRB- around the ghetto area in New York . This is what you ` de hear . Brilliant from start to finish , Aftershower Funk and Latin Strut are timeless classics.Lots of synchopated rythmic drums and wah-wah guitar overload . This is his first and undoubtedly best work before he cashed in on disco . Forget the rest , this is the one you want .
 Have always loved this Album now I have it on CD . Reminds me of my time in Brooklyn back in the early 70 's
 This 2-disc set is probably my favorite Paperboys CD -LRB- right now , that is . The Road to Ellenside might change my mind . -RRB- The Paperboys continue to explore new styles , including country , gospel , blues , jazz , swing , soul , and they sound just as fabulous as ever ! Favorite songs include Dilapatated Beauty , If I Could Be There , Omak Hotel , Blue Highway , Perfect Stillness , Shining Through You , Easy Chair , and What Would I Miss. . Oh man , this CD rocks .
 Vi a Tineke en un evento en M&eacute;xico llamado EuroJazz y la verdad no fu&eacute; extraordinaria su participaci&oacute;n . Probablemente porque los m&uacute;sicos acompa & ntilde ; antes ten&iacute;an 4 d&iacute;as de ensayo apenas . Sin embargo en este disco puede notarse una fusi&oacute;n completa de los integrantes de la banda . Jazz r&iacute;tmico y a tiempo , muy europeo y con interpretaciones originales . En especial , el tema A Wallk me parece fabuloso.Recomiendo 100 % este disco .
 Already watch and it was GREAT ! I have been looking for this for a while ! Thanks so much ! It was a pleasure doing business with you !
 this is a great album . most of there best songs have been taken from their previous albums 2 produce a quality album well worth your dosh
 David Rodigan and Sting International do an amazing job selecting on this one . I 'm just diving into the raggae sound and this album is perfect for an introduction . I have heard some of these tunes before and since and not at this quality . If you do n't own it , get it . I now have it on cd and record.I have had this album for over a year now and I still play the snot out of it . Supprisingly high quality sound . Many of these are 70 's -80 's era and recording equipment in the islands was rare and typically poor quality . David Rodigan is a 60 something dj from Germany and is a teacher at the Redbull school of Music . He is probly one of the most knowlagable people to put together a raggae compilation .
 `` One More Mile '' gathes 41 tracks , none of which are found on the Chess Box , and most of which have never before been available on an official US release.Much of this fine material is equal in quality to Waters ' better known output , and `` One More Mile '' includes lots of rarities and alternates spanning the late '40s to the early '70s , with some special points of interest
 Definitly one of the best albums of the year . Buy it . You wo n't regret it .
 Sick Little Suicide is one of THE greatest songs I have ever heard . The Matches have made an amazing CD with great music , but if you ever get the chance to see them live ... DO NOT pass it up ! They are a great band to hear live !
 ok so i picked up the matches self-produced cd about a year ago when i finally got to see them for the first time . i was not disappointed at the show , as they are one of the most energetic live bands i have ever seen , and later completely fell in love with this cd . the new version sold thru epitaph has a few changes , namely the lyrics in Track 11 and The Jackslap Cheer have been altered , Superman has been removed , and Borderline Creep and More Than Local Boys have been added . These were all good moves , save the lyric changes on track 11 . the boys had to switch up the lyrics in order to avoid a lawsuit from Billy Joel , but the song definitely is hurt by this change . pick up the demo version if at all possible . With respect to the quality of the songs , they 're kitschy , fun , and have a great pop sensibility . the better jams are Audio Blood , Sick Little Suicide , and More Than Local Boys . I highly recommend picking up this cd and being the first in your neighborhood to proclaim you hold in your hands and ears the next big thing as far as mainstream punk goes . It 's only a matter of time before The Locals . . I mean the Matches . . blow up .
 I have been a Matches fan for a while now , and i 'm so glad this CD is now available in stores . This album does not disapoint.From the moment you put in the CD , Dog-Ear Page get 's your emotions going , Eryn Smith will make you laugh , and these riffs and lyrics will make you feel young again.The Matches are a hard band to classify , just listen for yourself . This album is punk , pop , emo , and 80 's inspired all the way through . The creative lyrics will have you saying things like `` orange juice makes my toothpaste sour '' for days to come.If you want a feel-good album with no holds barred , please pick up this CD . Look for these guys in the not to far off future , they 'll be huge .
 Do not hesitate to buy this cd , from the first listen of the album , you 'll be hooked . I heard of the matches from a friend before they got signed and went to see them live because I loved their album so much . Now to hear it a little bit different is even better . The Matches are getting the attention they deserve for a kick ass band . I will say that I do enjoy some of the songs on the other album just because they 're a little more rougher and raw , but all in all it 's a great cd . My personal favs
 Ive seen the matches live and they are one of my all time favorite bands , and they 're just getting started ! You wont regret buying this album
 This is a great CD ! I recommend it to everyone !
 I heard about the matches from a friend of mine that had heard them @ the Dallas warped tour ... I was totally speechless the first time I heard them . I own tons of cds , but none like this . Most cds you listen to some tracks , but not all of them . You know there that real crappy one that you skip over , but there is not a SINGLE song on this cd that I would skip over . Their music is AWESOME . My favorite songs are probably Eryn Smith , Track 11 -LRB- That 's actually song 12 on the album -RRB- , Audio Blood , Restless , More that Local Boys , Sick Little Suicide , and Chain Me Free . Also I totally recommend their dvd its awesome . I have yet to see them live , but they are incredibliy awesome and you honestly ca n't miss out on this cd or your missing something AWESOME . I 'm not one for repition but I watched that DVD NINE times in one day and still could n't get enough !
 I first heard the song `` Dog-Eared Page '' when it popped up on Pandora radio , and was smitten . The melodies were so catchy , and the lyrics were fun to sing along with . Without any hesitation , I got the album . I 'm not going to say this is the greatest record or greatest band , but they are certainly one of the greatest -LRB- if not the greatest -RRB- underground acts of this generation . What shocked me is the level of diversity in this album . From the straight up pop-punk of some great tracks like the aforementioned , `` Dog-Eared Page '' , or the incredible , `` Chain Me Free '' to silly , beat-boxed pseudo-techno anthems to someone named Eryn Smith . This album is fresh from start to finish , and was a pleasure to listen to . I ca n't wait to hear some more music from this band in the future .
 Let me just say I 'm a huge fan of The Matches and I own all of their cd 's . and IMO this is sitll their best . I can put this cd in and listen to it all the way through without skipping a song .1 . Dog Eared Page - 9.5 / 10 This song is really great , I think the lyrics are awesome , one of my favorites2.Audio Blood - 10/10 The first Matches song I ever heard and it got me hooked3 . Chain me Free - 10/10 Possibly my favorite song on the cd , I like the guitar solo4 . Borderline Creep - 7/10 One of the lowere points on the cd but not entirely bad5 . The Restless - 8/10 Kind of a different song , not my favorite , but not my least favorite either6 . More Than Local Boys - 8.5 / 10 This song kind of grew on me , I really like the lyrics on this one too7 . Eryn Smith - 8.5 / 10 This song really showcase the diverse style of The Matches8 . Say 18 - 7/10 Again one of the lower points I feel but still ok9 . Jack Slap Cheer - 9/10 A fast paced song , different but I like it10 . Destination Nowhere Near - 9/10 I really like this one too and i like the harmonica in the middle11 . Sick Little Suicide - 10/10 Another awesome song one of the best on the cd , great guitar solo12 . Skratched out - 10/10 This is kind of a weird acoustic one , but believe it or not I love it one of my favorites
 Buy this album . Listen to it over and over on constant repeat and watch how you 've magically become hoarse and can no longer speak . Oh , that 's because you could n't help singing along at the top of your lungs.Go out and buy `` Decomposer '' and `` A Band In Hope '' and repeat the same procedure -LRB- possibly with more singing and less screaming refrains -RRB- . E. Von Dahl , though , is where you 'll find the song `` Audio Blood '' . If you 've ever been to one of those concerts were you wish you could have stayed and sweated for a few more hours in the pit , then you 'll appreciate Audio Blood .
 This band has won me over . I bought this CD because my kid liked the song that was on his video game `` Burnout3 '' . There is not a song on the CD I do n't like. , If the CD goes in the player , it does n't come out for at least a week . This is one of the greatest bands of thei genre and for some reason they are not the BIGGEST !! That needs to change . Buy this CD and pass the word on . the Matches rock !
 Wow ! This cd is the best !!!! Its my favorite ! :-RRB- All the songs are great ! I really like Chain Me Free and Sick Little Suicide . Just to let everyone know the cd is explicit . I didnt know that at first because it dose n't have the explicit label on it ! But if you can get past that then go out and buy this cd ! Its amazing . All the songs are really really good ! I have listened to this cd like 50 times and it does n't get old ! I hear they are really good in concert to ! And if you like the Matches you 'll like Motion City Soundtrack ! Go buy the cds ! Trust me you wont be dissapointed !!!!!
 I have had this cd for maybe a year and a half now . And i stil have song of the songs stuck in my head ! Every single song on this cd makes you want to jump around and rock out ! It feels almost like seeing them live every time you listen to this cd!The lyrics are also very well done , which does not always happen with bands like the matches ! But these are!The standout tracks would be `` Eryn Smith '' , `` Dog-eared page '' , `` destination nowhere near '' and `` track 11 '' . I really do think that all of the songs are great though , really ! If you like this kind of music AT ALL , you will LOVE this cd !
 Alright , I saw the Matches in concert in Toronto . They were opening up for Reel Big Fish . Right away I noticed something about there music something speicial ! . . I bought there CD and i was n't disappointed at all , it 's amazing . With songs like Sick Little Suicide , Eryn Smith , and Scratched out , how could this album not become a hit . . Do n't worry if you hate punk music -LRB- like me -RRB- you might still realy like this . . It has something for everyone . . It 's awsome , good guitar riffs ! , good melodies ! ... PETER
 This is one of the best cd 's i have ever listened to . They have a crazy high-energy sound that rocks your socks . All the songs are great a must have punk cd . Now if you ever get the chance to see them live you have to go . They are one of the best live bands that i 've seen . A great band .
 I saw The Matches at the Warped Tour -LRB- Dallas show -RRB- and the crowd was huge . I thought they were great live and I love their CD ! P.S. GO TO THE WARPED TOUR !!!!!!! you wo n't regret it and there are a ton of awesome bands
 Undoubtedly The Matches have something going for them . Epitaph obviously made a smart choice signing this fresh , strong-willed new band however most people do n't appreciate their upbringing as a local Oakland band named The Locals . I have been a fan of these guys since hearing them at a local grange show in a suburb town called Danville . It was n't the largest of shows , most people were there to see another local band , The Locals were just another no name band playing in the shaddow of the others . However once they took the stage I noticed the intensity they had . Once the first note stuck the entire house came down . I have never seen such determination and skill within a band . Although recorded in their basement , they 're original release was amazing . I am very surprised that Epitaph had decided not to include Superman , this was a great track . As The Locals got bigger so did their ego . I noticed a lot less local shows being played and a lot more tours . I have not seen the band in over two years . Best of luck to them , however I hope they do not forget their roots .
 One of my good friends writes for an online zine and he got an interview with The Matches and brought me along . They were in New York and preforming at a local music store . As soon as I heard them play `` Dog-eared Page '' , I was speechless . This band is one of the best that I 've heard in a very long time . All the songs are great of this cd . Plus , the guys are GREAT and fun to talk to . A little crazy , but great . I 'd recommend this cd to ANYONE and EVERYONE . This cd is amazing and I think that everyone should own a copy ... I own 2 and one is signed !!! YES !
 The Matches are an incredible band . They can be described as pop punk and sound a little bit like Green Day , but mostly have their own sound . I went to the 6/12/04 L3 show at iMusicast in Oakland and they were absolutely insane . Everybody was going crazy . I would highly recommend this album as it is very addictive.Dog-Eared Page
 Best Live show ever to see ... Amazing lyrics , Amazing music , Amazing Guys . Nothing more to say ...
 I went to see Matchbook Romance -LRB- an amaizng band , and is great live -RRB- last July and The Matches were opening up for them , and i all i can say is that i was blown away . They were absolutely amazing . They had so much energy and talent , and the songs were good . well , i got the CD , and i was n't disappointed.These have some incredibly catchy songs and some great guitar . These guys are like no band out there right now , they completely stand out . There are even some great solos -LRB- see `` Sick Little Suicide '' . Really good -RRB- stuck in there . They have a harmonizing thing where they have two singers -LRB- the two guitarists -RRB- singing , and it sounds really good -LRB- See `` Chain Me Free '' -RRB- . The lyrics -LRB- emo influenced -RRB- are very funny -LRB- See `` Say 18 '' and `` Eryn Smith '' -RRB- and the songs range in styles , drawing influences from all over the place . Over all , these guys are just a very unique band , that is very talented , and worth your time , not matter what your style of music is.The best songs are
 I saw these guys at warped tour and i was blown away . I knew they were good , i had the cd , but after seeing them play , i had a new respect for them . They had so much energy , Shawn 's voice was flawless , the guitars sounded perfect , and you could tell the entire audience was digging it . My favorite songs on the CD are Chain Me Free , Audio Blood , Sick Little Suicide , and the untitled track . This is worth your money , and you will not be let down . If you ever get a chance , go to one of their shows . It is nothing short of amazing .
 THE MATCHES cd is awseome and their live performances are out of this world . The band members are also the coolest guys and love talking to their fans after their shows . Every song on this cd is excellent and I usually never like every song on a cd . Their sound is unique which is what makes them great , but if you like bands like Taking Back Sunday , Fall Out Boy , Brand New , Matchbook Romance , etc. , then you should spend every dime you have to buy this cd . I drove across an entire state and traveled an entire highway system to see them two nights in a row in concert because they are that good . Enough said .
 I got this CD after hearing one of their songs on Mark Hoppus ' podcast.Wow.It just blew me away . I 'll not go so far as to say that every song is amazing , but they 're a great band , and this CD is certainly a great buy . From Dog Eared Page to Borderline Creep , you 'll find a set of catchy , brilliant songs . I have n't tired of them , even after listening to their CD on repeat numerous times.I reccommend this CD to anyone who wants to listen to some great rock music .
 These guys are really really freaking good , and even better in concert . Normally , with a lot of CD 's , if you listen to the whole thing a couple of times , you pick out songs you like more than others , and are able to narrow down your playlist to the `` better '' tracks on the album . Not so with The Matches . After roughly 9 months worth of listening , I am still hard-pressed to pick out a `` best '' song on it , because they 're all really good . This would have to be one of the best punk CD 's I own . Download the free mp3 's on their website , and listen to them . If you like the samples , then you 'll love this CD too .
 The Matches are amazing . I did n't think much of it when a friend of mine told me about them , after getting this cd however I realized how awesome these guys are . Eryn Smith , Dog-Eared page , Superman -LRB- not on the Epitach cd -RRB- , and Sick Little Suicide are all great songs . Not a bad song on the entire cd . This is one of the best cds I 've heard in a long time . They are all over the place , so basically if you are a fan of ANY type of punk , ska-punk , or alternative music , GET THIS CD ! It 's not like any other punk rock band around and these guys are gon na be huge some day ! You will NOT be dissappointed , I promise you .
 I 've had this CD sitting on my shelf for months because I bought it after hearing Sick Little Suicide on a sampler . Just returned from Warped Tour and heard The Matches live . They were one of the best bands there . Beat out Fall Out Boy , All American Rejects , and the rest . When I got back I put this in my car and I 've had it there since . Do youself a favor and if you like some of the new punk , get this . The band has some real talent is not just following a trend .
 you 've got to love these guys , from the catchy songs to energic shows ... you ca n't go wrong . i recommend this cd to anyone who loves music and more importantly going to their shows , they will not disappoint you.i am so happy they are getting the knowledgement they deserve.rock on . \ m / ^_^ \ m /
 this is one of the best CDs I 've heard in ages . the band 's vocals shout with energy , their lyrics are layered in songs you want to keep singing when the record stops . these guys are first-rate musicians with a talent for diversity . what can I say , the matches are great .
 i have the matches original cd and been to a couple of their concerts . i 'm so excited they got signed to a label and re-released EVDKTL ! its so awesome , i wish superman was on it , i 'd love to hear that remastered but i will live . all the songs sound awesome . i definately reccomend this cd , its so addicting . seeing the guys live is even better so go see them when they come to your town . i love you matt , justin , jon , and shawn and good luck w / the cd , its bitchin : -RRB-
 Loud , fast , catchy , and original . With E. Von Dahl Killed the Locals , The Matches debut with a bang . From start to finish this cd is a refreshing change from all of the Emo , Screamo , and Metalcore bands that are flooding the Punk Rock scene . The Matches combine a variety of genres to produce their original sound . This cd is the perfect summer soundtrack for people of all musical tastes . My personal favorites are Chain Me Free , Borderline Creep , and Eryn Smith .
 I 've been a fan of these guys since the days of the original Locals demo -LRB- five tracks with the cartoon cover -RRB- . I bought the original version of this CD over a year ago at the release show . Great pop-punk . Catchy , fun , not whiny . I do n't understand why `` Superman '' is n't on this , but I can live with its absense -LRB- I 've got two other versions of it -RRB- . It 's awesome to hear `` More Than Local Boys '' with quality production . Why are you still reading this ? BUY THE CD !!!
 The matches are amazing . I saw them a while back b4 they got signed and everything and they were just as good . The new album is awsome . Pretty much like the one sold @ the shows but with better quality , and a few changes . A must have for all punk rock fans . Check the site out @ http://www.thematches.com and also go to their shows bc they r awsome . Also , check out The ARmy of Freshman who are friends with the matches @ http : / www.armyoffreshman.com Later
 the matches are awesome live ! buy this . no regrets . just mad crazy punk . my favorite tracks ? the entire cd .
 In a sea of Good Charlottes and Simple Plans , The Matches truly stand out in thier national debut . Having heard the Demo Debut Release and the National Release , not much has changed , Matt , Shawn , Jon , and Justin know how to kick ass and take names . This CD is a must have for anyone , not just punks . Just all over feel good music .
 waited a long time for this album to be released , it has two tracks different from the album of theirs i already own ... just solid punk rock all the way through . some of my favorite tracks
 The matches rock , no doubt about it . I have seen them live and they are my favorite local band ever . I saw them a little more than a year ago for the first time and I called a few friends and told them that this band weas going to be huge someday . At the time I copmpared them to sum 41 and said they were even better than them and to look out for them . Well check it out , here they are on epitaph and i am so proud of them . Only problem is , superman is not on this cd and it is one of my favorites and the fave of many others . that is too bad . all in all , be sure to grab this cd . you will really like it .
 I liked it very much!It 's really excellent
 Like the others this is again a awsome Scooter album.The songs are going in the right way of the future.They are the GREATIST .
 I heard these guys broke up last year . IF that 's true , it 's a pity . This CD really impressed me , as it journeyed between Trance , House , and just straight up Pop.i 'd recommend it .
 This is an excellent return to form for Scooter and marks the new arrival in the group of Axel Coon , who replaced Ferris in the band . The album starts off very powerfully with the excellent intro of `` Last Warning '' and then the thumping beats of `` How Much Is The Fish ? '' `` We Are The Greatest '' and `` Call Me Manana , '' all excellent Scooter tracks in their own right . The rest of the album sound fresh and excellent , without exception , whether it 's HP doing another one of his ballads in `` Eyes Without A Face '' or belting out the chants in `` Hands Up . '' The instrumentals on this album are also very good , particularly `` Do n't Stop . '' But all the tracks on this album are wonderful and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone , particularly anyone who has n't heard a Scooter album before .
 This is a good album from Scooter with some really fine tunes on it . I would recommend any dance or rave fan to have this gem . If you liked this album you should most definitely get their debut album `` and the beat goes on '' . The closet thing you will hear to perfection .
 This is the best Techno CD you are ever going to find , Scooter brings the Old Euro-Techno back on the European Top Charts once more , if you are a techno fan you will love this no doubt.Get his now .
 This is one of the best works by german group SCOOTER . The album starts with an deep intro and suddenly kicks off with its best track '' How much is da fish . . '' . `` Call me manana '' , similiar to that , follows up shortly . I personally enjoy song No. 10 '' Everything is borrowed '' , great example of transe techno . CD 's is definitely worth buying , it will be a great addition to a your DJ collection .
 Well , it 's 1y old CD , but it 's really best European music , no Ami scream ... You just must have it , hear it and feel it !
 i need a help in oder to buy this c
 The music has beat and I think it is the best . It makes you want to go and dance all night long . I think that the shold make videros and bring them to America
 I 've heard this CD , and I think it is great . I just wish it were less expensive .
 the crowes rocked out with up-beat positive vibes on this record ... and i thank them for it . my god , folks , there 's something on the other side of pumping your shnass fulla poppy depression . by your side is the soundtrack to my day , fuzzymuffins !
 Few bands have released albums as good as Shake Your Moneymaker , now The Black Crowes have done it twice . They have reestablished good time blues . Every song took my breath away the first time I heard them , and continues to do so every time I listen to it , . I certainly recommend this cd to any fan of american rock and roll .
 From beginning to end , `` By Your Side '' kept me on my toes ! The opener `` Go Faster '' kind of sets the pace for the album . The songs are more positive lyrically & musically than any other Crowes album . `` Kickin ' My Heart Around '' is similar to Aerosmith 's `` Draw the Line '' & rocks just as hard ! Title track `` By Your Side '' is reminiscent of the Stones ' classic , `` Tumbling Dice '' & has a beautiful chorus . `` Horsehead '' just plain ROCKS !! `` Welcome to the Good Times '' , the album 's only ballad , is kind of a tear-jerker , & `` Heavy '' is , well , FUN ! To sum it all up , `` By Your Side '' is a rockin ' disc ! I would definitely slap this one on at a party ! Tired of `` alternative '' BS ? Check this one out ! This is something called
 The black crowes have gone back to basics on their new release BY YOUR SIDE . It has the hard hitting southern feel good rock sound of their earlier release , SHAKE YOUR MONEY MAKER . The songs are well written , and most seem to be upbeat love songs . Towards the end the album does get a little monotonus , but with soon to be classics like , KICKIN ' MY HEART AROUND , GO FASTER , and VICE AND VIRTUE , this album is a most have for your collection . Overall this is a hardcore , kick butt southern rock album , with a chilling slide guitar for effect .
 This band is not for the person who is looking for some deep rooted meaning to life . But if your into Classic Rock and Roll with a southern bent , the tunes contained on this disc are infectious . I enjoyed every song from the first listen and Robinsons vocals continue to give the raw edge that drives the bands music . Well worth the bucks .
 The new album of the Black Crowes titled `` By Your Side '' first sounds very old , but afterwards you , ve been rockin ' all the time !!! It 's a very refreshing album.When you know the BC , you should know that the last years there was much in the band . Now times are changing , guitar-player Marc Ford and bass-player Johnny Cold are gone . The new bass-player is Sven Pippen . The whole guitar-parts where played by Rich Robinson . The album begins with a real party-song , and it never slows really down . But the feelinig within the seperate songs are very different . Somethimes very emotional , sometimes not . I just wan na say
 The whole root to the problems yer Crowes have faced the past few months can be traced back to 1992 . `` Southern Harmony . . '' was such a complete album , and at the time was probably one of the best rock albums of the past ten years , that to follow up something like that was almost too great a task . While `` Amorica '' contained a lot of crunchy sounds and even funkier rhythms than expected , `` Three Snakes ... '' was a bit of a letdown . Not to take away from their ability to rock on-stage -LRB- Their High As The Moon tour date in Paris , December of 1992 remains one of my best concert expereinces to date ! -RRB- for that has always been their forte . With this album , my faith has been renewed in the brothers Robinson . While you can hear a progression from the experimental sounds of `` Three Snakes ... '' seep into the speakers mid-way through , at the heart of this album pulses a raging quagmire of southern boogie , gospel , soul , and down-and-out dirty blues . If your faith was put to the test by the last two offerings , do yourself a favour and give this one a firm listening ; proof that the strut has n't slowed and the magic has n't faded . Thanks , guys , for getting this one together !
 The Black Crowes are still not inventors , they 're not teachers , and they 're not angry . They just put energy and soul into music and life like any good rock-and-roll purveyor should . So listen and be happy ; some of these songs are going to be classics . Some , after four albums , sound like slightly worn musical recipies , but it all tastes good . Get an old beat-up pick-up , a big dog , the tattoo you 've always wanted , some Willie Nelson and some Black Crowes , and hit the road for a month !
 This is a great CD from a band that simply does not run out of steam ! A mixture of the Stones-ish rock and roll as featured on their first two albums , with some gospel-tinged numbers as well -- great stuff ! Chris and Rich robinson are amazing songwriters ! Any Black Crowes fan should not be without this disc in their collection!This album did not sell well back when it was released , and their label subsequently dropped them -- a shame , because were it not for the general public 's downspiraling of musical tastes back in the late nineties , the album would have done much better . Korn , Limp Bizkit , and other crap were ruling the charts . Mainstream rock was n't as bad back then as it is now , but starting to get there ... the last 20 years or so of the general decline in quality of what the public considers good music just makes my stomach turn.So let 's not let the tanking of mainstream rock music ruin our OWN individual tastes ! Buy this CD , and support quality blues-rock music ! Hang in there !
 This is a good old fashion rock cd . If you are a fan of the Black Crowes , you will enjoy this release . If you only know them for `` She Talks to Angels '' then you MAY not like this quite as much . If you enjoy their music generally then you will love this CD . Good music and good singing . Lots of bluesy sounds . Most songs are really good . Only a few 3 star songs , most of the songs are 4 or 5 stars -LRB- My rating system is 3
 If something better than CDs are ever invented and we all have to switch over to this new-and-improved , state-of-the-art watchamadoodle , then The Black Crowes ' BY YOUR SIDE will be the first watchamadoodle I 'll buy . I mean , rock & roll has no right to sound this good -- and it certainly is n't fair that so much talent should be confined to one rock & roll group . But it is and here 's the proof
 Initially , I was n't floored by By Your Side . The Black Crowes ' catalog -LRB- despite what critics might tell you -RRB- up to this album had been a steady growing process , culminating in the masterpiece album Three Snakes and One Charm . And when I popped this new disc into the player after nearly three years of anticipation , I immediately saw it as a step backward . It seemed to be a recall to the band 's early days , what some mistakenly mislabel as their heyday . But , I soon realized that the step backward was n't necessarily a bad thing . True , I would have liked to have seen the band carry on with the jangly , jam-heavy material on Three Snakes , but there is no denying that By Your Side has some damn fine songs on it . The standouts are the album 's first single , `` Kickin ' My Heart Around '' , and its rousing closer , `` Virtue and Vice . '' These two songs are instant classics and I defy anyone to not shake their money maker when they are played . In fact , every song on this album is a winner . And that alone makes it worth picking up . How many other bands can assemble eleven smokin ' tracks in one shot ? Not many . I guess the thing to do with By Your Side , as with any Black Crowes release , is to listen to it based on its own merits and not shadow it with comparisons to its predecessors.Also worth noting is the sizeable number of b-sides released with this album 's singles . All of them are amazing songs and it 's a puzzle as to why they were n't included on the album . Definitely worth seeking out , if you can still find them . <
 Great effor by the Crowes , check out the Zeppelinesque `` Heavy '' - rippin!The import CD bonus track info :01 / 21/99 `` Limited edition pressing of the band 's highly anticipated 1999 album with a two track bonus disc featuring rarities , ` It Must Be Over ' and ` Twice As Hard ' -LRB- from VH1 Hard Rock Live -RRB- . 13 tracks in all , with the album featuring the singles ` Kickin ' My Heart Around ' & ` By Your Side ' . Double slimline jewelcase .
 From beginning to end , `` By Your Side '' kept me on my toes ! The opener `` Go Faster '' kind of sets the pace for the album . The songs are more positive lyrically & musically than any other Crowes album . `` Kickin ' My Heart Around '' is similar to Aerosmith 's `` Draw the Line '' & rocks just as hard ! Title track `` By Your Side '' is reminiscent of the Stones ' classic , `` Tumbling Dice '' & has a beautiful chorus . `` Horsehead '' just plain ROCKS !! `` Welcome to the Good Times '' , the album 's only ballad , is kind of a tear-jerker , & `` Heavy '' is , well , FUN ! To sum it all up , `` By Your Side '' is a rockin ' disc ! I would definitely slap this one on at a party ! Tired of `` alternative '' BS ? Check this one out ! This is something called
 i would buy this aalbum , but first i 'd like to know what the extra tracks are . post the tracks and then i 'll buy the cd .
 I 've been a Black Crowes fan since the first note of `` Shake Your Money Maker '' rang out across the airwaves . I 've seen them live several times - and was only disappointed once . Chris was obviously not in his body that night . Since then he has made some brave and miraculous changes and recoveries and it SHOWS in this CD and in his performances . His energy and love for life and music is back and revealed proudly!Being a musician myself it always does my heart good to see other performers loving what they do for a living - without the disadvantages of drugs . The Black Crowes have always written songs that come from the soul , no matter what the content , but in this last CD you can feel the spirituality that accompanies the soulful revelations . I give this CD a definite 5 stars and I congratulate The Black Crowes for taking the necessary steps to get back on track and back into the game of life !! And thank you gentlemen for a fantastic show at the Bronco Bowl in Dallas on April 11 , 1999 !!!
 Immer gibt es ville leute desen liebsliebmusik is es am besten . Aber es gibt nur eine grupe dass am besten Musik mach . Sie sind The Black Crows .
 The Crows `` Shake Your Money Maker '' is still one of the only disks in my changer that rarely gets taken out . Two albums later and , well , they have yet to put out an album of Money Makers quality . Where the two previous albums had only a couple of songs that really measured up to what you would exspect from Robinson and the boys , By Your Side continues , song after song , to show why the Crows are a great rock band . At a period when the industry is seemingly nothing but pop and teen idol music , the Crows offer something definitely worthwhile . My only real complaint about this album is that it is too damn short . Four more tracks and this would have easily ran the gammit .
 I just wanted to reassure everyone that the real Black Crowes are now back ! This is truly the best cd I 've bought in a long time & I recommend it to all .
 The first time a friend of mine played the Black Crowes for me I said , `` Hey , they sound like the Stones when they knew how to rock '' . Then the BCs got famous and the made some bad albums . When I heard this new one I thought `` Hey that sounds like Rod Stewart and the Faces '' . This album is good ol' Rock and Roll , bluesy , with rockin ' riffs and screaming vocals . This album is better than anything the Stones or Rod Stewart has put out since 1980 . If you like Rock and Roll , go buy this album
 I 'm not sure which member writes the lyrics , but the man is in love . The Black Crowes are definitetly flying high ! While still retaining the classic energies of the `` Exile on Main Street '' \ Blues frequency , the Crowes , lyrically , seem a bit wiser . The love songs really feel genuine . Just the phrasing and timing on the lyrics , alone , make cuts like `` Diamond Ring '' and `` Then She said My Name '' chunky , tasty rockers that you 'll want to eat with a spoon to get every drop . `` Go Faster '' has the same smoking , shotgun feel as Aerosmith 's `` Young Lust '' and `` HorseHead '' is a heavy dose . Even if you only know the Crowes from the MTV videos , get this album ... good stuff .
 I 'm a jaded Aussie music/film reviewer . And I say
 BYS is by far the return for the Crowe 's back to basic rock n ' roll , the way MoneyMaker is . As a fan of the Crowe 's I like all the albums , but I like this sound that the Crowe 's do best . The last 2 albums -LRB- Amorica & 3S & 1C -RRB- are flavored with funk and southern country -LRB- & rock -RRB- , but BYS is pretty much roadhouse boogie . The 90 's version of the Face 's with Rod Stewart .
 After the disappointment of the last Crowes disc `` Three Snakes and A Charm '' the boys return in stunning form with a cd full of great rocking tunes . There is plenty of great guitar work from Rich Robinson while Chris sings like his very life depended on it . Notable cuts include the new single `` Kicking my heart around '' , the opener `` Go Faster '' , `` Virtue and Vice '' as well as the title track.This cd ranks alongside their best . Well worth buying especially if you cant get enough 70 's rock ahh la The Rolling Stones , The Faces or Aerosmith .
 With `` By Your Side '' the Black Crowes rediscover the essence of 70s blues rock . The songs on this album are marked by infectious grooves and brilliant guitar riffs toped off with Chris Robinson 's soulful vocal gyrations . Do n't miss the album 's coda `` Virtue And Vice , '' a magnificent and majestic song that encapsulates the best elements of the Crowes ' work . Hopefully , the Black Crowes , with strong albums like `` By Your Side , '' will continue to sustain and perhaps even invigorate the genre of blues rock which has unfortunately become forgotten amidst today 's candy pop and rap onslaught .
 The boys have put together one emotionally charged album . Starting with the first two tracks , `` Go Faster '' and `` Kickin '' , you can see that this album is going to be one kick-ass ride !! My only complaint -LRB- although small -RRB- is the omission of any slow , acoustic number such as the largely underated `` Non-fiction '' and `` Descending '' from `` Amorica '' . The album , as a whole , sounds like a set from their concert tour . Standout tracks include the funk/groove of `` Diamond Ring '' , the last-call-for-alcohol-song of `` Welcome to the Goodtimes '' , and my favorite , `` Virtue & Vice '' , which has probably the most excellent chorus since `` Remedy '' . Overall , a superb album , and Chris Robinson -LRB- I STILL feel -RRB- is incredibly underated !!
 While I 've had some problems with some of the promotional efforts for the album , the album is definitely vintage crowes . `` Go Faster '' is the best opening song of any of their albums and `` Virtue and Vice '' is a great closer . Lots of good feeling rhythms and choruses in between . Horsehead , Heavy , Only a Fool are great . Still does not overthrow Southern Harmony as the best Crowes album , especially as lyrics go , and not as original as Amorica , but its a strong album . Probably will appeal more to Shake Your Moneymaker fans and radio listeners , which means more album sales and publicity , which means Columbia Records will be happy .
 This is the Crowes best effort since their debut . Several personnel changes later , they are back to playing hard driving rock n ' roll . Not a lot of stoner nonsense on this one , which is more than welcome.Would have considered a five star rating if not for the less than stellar production values - a bit more crispness in sound quality would have helped . These tunes should be even better live.Good to see someone kick out basic R ' R to give us much needed relief from the unyielding onslaught of divas , teeny boppers , flip-hop , and other so called `` music '' flooding our senses .
 I loved the new cd . I bought it the day it came out . it definitly has a new style which is great . its more bluesy and has a new tone . i just thought it was th best . the crowes are for the sure the best rock and roll , rock and roll band ever .
 I know I could get punched for saying this , but I like this CD even better than their first one - Shake Your Money Maker -LRB- but yes , I love that one also -RRB- . Being a guitarist , I love the guitar work on By Your Side . The guitar riffs by Rich Robinson are catchy and heavy throughout the CD . Chris sounds fantastic and enthusiastic . There 's scarcely a dud on the entire CD . The feel of the CD is very upbeat and optimistic . There are radio-friendly songs such as Kicking My Heart Around , Go Faster and a couple others , but there are also great songs that you 'd probably never hear on the radio . Some hot spots for me include Go Tell the Congregation , By Your Side , Then She Said My Name , Virtue & Vice , Heavy . If you like rock & roll , I do n't see what you would n't like about this CD . Great music for a party or for when you just feel good and want to jam . I think this is their most underrated CD . Buy it .
 This is one of the Crowes ' best albums , along with SH&MC. ; It has been a long time since I heard Amorica , so I can not really compare . It is one of the best albums out there . Listen to some bland nu-metal -LRB- e.g. , Godsmack , Korn -RRB- and you 'll hear how refreshing an album such as this is . This is rock n ' roll . They 've been compared with the Stones and Humble Pie , only I perceive they are an improvement on these bands and have a style unique . Soul is the word . Great soul . Good songs . I like their new effort , Warpaint , but I like the Crowes a bit more rockin , ' overall , like in this album . But I love all the Crowes I 've heard.With `` By your side '' you can not help but move and groove if you have an ounce of soul left in your body after years of grunge and nu-metal . I love these guys ; there is no one else like them today , or any past day.But if you do like other styles of rock , put this album in sometime . You 'll find a very nice , refreshing change.And THESE GUYS ARE DEFINATELY NOT SELL-OUTS ! You can easily tell that they love the music . They are greater than Aerosmith , in my opinion . Much more funk and soul .
 I do n't know why , this Crowes record always seems to get the most rotation , in my car . It Could Be that it 's starts strong and finishes strong . It is probaly the most solid of all the Crowes ' albums . ` Nuff said .
 Sometimes I wish Chris would just be quiet and let his brother play longer ; that guitar is so southern , so gritty and so sweet . Do n't let the nay-sayers on here sway you . `` By Your Side '' is too delicious to miss , right down to its classic cover .
 With only owning the Crowes first 2 , and what some would call their best albums , I was anxious to get By Your Side . It was only more recently that I learned this album was a forced studio effort . It seems , at times , tight and forced , but the true talent of the Crowes shows through . Even under the ... supervision of their record company the Crowes add their personal rock n ' roll touch and attitude . . Songs like Go Faster , By Your Side , Horsehead , Only A Fool , Go Tell The Congregation and Virtue and Vice will be classic rock songs . In a decade were manufactured teen pop ruled the scene and record companies were trying to make carbon copies , the Crowes keep a breaming rock generation alive .
 On this one , they go back to what they do best . This is a return , musically , to the sound they had on their first CD . They strip away everything else and just get back to basic rock 'n' roll , something they do better than most groups out there . My only minor comlaint is that the songwriting is n't up to their usual standards .
 Take a seat on the old stool , and pop in this CD because it is the best rock album out right now . Mike Snowden Plays the lead guitar with such gusto that I sometimes cry when I listen to that one congregation song . Ethan skeels does wonders with his banjo , and Shawn `` MINI MAN '' Smith plays enter sandman perfectly . Gorbie on the drums could n't have played any better on this album . If you get any album in your life , get this one . Its awesome . And of course , if you aint down with the black crowes , I got 2 words for ya
 This album rocks . All of the Crowes works are great , but this one is more up tempo and great road music . Chris and Rich know the score , and they should be reserved a place in the rock and roll hall of fame .
 It is obvious that the inspiration was turned up to 11 on these guys . It never let 's up . The best rock album I 've heard in a while . The RnR Hall of Fame should reserve a space now in the 2010 's for the BCs .
 I ca n't stop listening to this CD . Even their worst song is better than most bands best hits . It grooves . I definately give it 5 stars .
 Bing , bing , bing ! The crowes rock all the way through this one ! MUCH better than Three Snakes & One Charm -LRB- an album I feel they made so people knew they were still alive ! -RRB- I recommend this one all the way !
 I saw the Crowes live at the Aregon in Chicago before I heard the album and they cooked . I bought the album and it was like I was still at the concert . Great fans , great album . Chicago loves the Crowes . I ca n't wait to see them again May 8th .
 Finnaly the Black Crowes are back to what they are doing best-dirty , bluesy rock & roll . Probably the most Black Crowes 's fans -LRB- including myself -RRB- were wondering whether they will produce an album to match the level set by their first two projects . Yes , The Black Crowes delivered it . It is a huge enjoyment to listen `` By Your Side '' . WELL DONE BOYS ! I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE YOU ON STAGE .
 i saw the crowes do some warm-up shows at the roxy in LA and they blew the doors off the place with the new stuff . true , they relied heavily on older tunes , but i was impressed with the new songs . that guy audrey -LRB- new lead guitarist -RRB- seems kinda like a poser , ala `` leg up on the floor amp , lean back and play like it 's just killing you '' but that was forgivable . i miss marc ford . no messin ' around with him . amorica is one of the best albums of all time . i ca n't figure out what anybody 's problem with that one was . `` by your side '' ranks up there with `` three snakes '' for me . good , solid effort . it 's what i love about the crowes . you know what you 're going to get , and you sure as hell get it .
 This Cd will blow you away . The black crowes once again come out with a great sound and with unbelieveable tunes . With them playing at the Super Bowl pre-game show hopefully they will get the attention they deserve . If your a black crowes fan you must get this for you collection .
 Love all the songs on this CD . I 'm a big Crowes fan , but I think this is my favorite CD overall . It is a good balance of upbeat and insightful tracks . `` Virtue and Vice '' gets my vote for outstanding song of the album .
 With only owning the Crowes first 2 , and what some would call their best albums , I was anxious to get By Your Side . It was only more recently that I learned this album was a forced studio effort . It seems , at times , tight and forced , but the true talent of the Crowes shows through . Even under the nazi supervision of their record company the Crowes add their personal rock n ' roll touch and attitude . . Songs like Go Faster , By Your Side , Horsehead , Only A Fool , Go Tell The Congregation and Virtue and Vice will be classic rock songs . In a decade were manufactured teen pop ruled the scene and record companies were trying to make carbon copies , the Crowes keep a breaming rock generation alive .
 This is easily the finest Black Crowes ' record since Shake Your Money Maker ! The band just sounds like it 's had a complete blood transfusion -LRB- soul tranfusion ? -RRB- and the songs are rockin ' and funky and vital again . Beginning as early back as Southern Harmony and Musical Companion , The Crowes have had a tendency to slip into somewhat spacey and -LRB- frequently -RRB- tedious mid-tempo stuff ... there is absolutely none of that here -- the songwriting is more accomplished than ever and the playing is downright fierce . By Your Side is a worthy addition to any serious rock 'n' roll collection .
 The Crowes have put out an album filled with classic song after classic song after classic song . From `` Go Faster '' to `` Virtue & Vice '' the album is the best party album since Moneymaker . Although Southern Harmony is probably still my favorite , By Your Side features a must different sound than on Amorica or Three Snakes . It 's flat out southern rock 'n' roll that The Black Crowes , and only The Black Crowes , can give you . Buy it , NOW !
 What can I say , this is an album by a fantastic band that has excellent catchy tunes , but will go unnapreciated by many because of lacking popularity . BYS is a record that really will have you dancing . The only thing in modern crowes history better than the album is a live performance . Ca n't wait for an album with Jimmy Page in the near future . Highlights of this album include go faster , then she said my name , virtue and vice , and go tell the congregation . Strangly , only a fool is the single they are promoting on the radio 's and i think it is one of the worst songs on the album ? Oh well , any radio play is good for a fantastic band that deserves more credit . Job well done Robinsons and CO. .
 I love , love , love this CD . I originally bought it after seeing the VH1 BEHIND THE MUSIC on the Black Crowes , coincidentally enough , before I saw them in concert with Lenny Kravitz . Prior to seeing that , I had only purchased the Crowes ' first CD . So , I bought their new CD , put it in , and JAMMED ! -LRB- If you have n't seen them in concert yet , you must ! They 're awesome ! -RRB- From the 1st track `` Go Faster '' , clear through to the last track , this CD jams ! Chris Robinson 's vocals and Rich 's guitar playing are impeccable . I ca n't get enough of this CD and highly recommend it to others .
 If the Black Crowes had decided to rest on their early 90 's fame and fortune , they 'd still be remembered fondly ... but they 've chosen to move ahead , and the results on By Your Side are a happier Chris Robinson and some nice crunching riffs ... I defy one to find a better riff than Horsehead from one of the Neo-90 's bands ... and they still kick some rear live !
 BY YOUR SIDE once again shows the BLACK CROWES rockin ' like they did with their first albums . The album starts off with GO FASTER , which is straight ahead no-holds barred rockin ' song that is a great way for the album to begin . KICKIN ' MY HEART AROUND continues right where FASTER ended , it is another no nonsense rockin song . BY YOUR SIDE slows the tempo down abit . I like this song , it has emotion to it , of course CHRIS comes off sounding alittle like Rod Stewart on this tune , thats not a bad thing . HORSEHEAD is a down and dirty rockin song , its a hit . ONLY A FOOL , HEAVY , WELCOME TO THE GOODTIMES , are also good songs . One song that I find myself listen to over and over again is DIAMOND RING . It has a gospel , R&B sound that makes it a real pleasure to listen to . I think this disc would make a wonderful addition to any serious music fans collection .
 I do n't think I 'm the average Black Crowes fan as I actually LOVED `` 3 Snakes & One Charm '' , I probably listened to as much if not more than any other Crowes album -LRB- it 's very close between `` 3 Snakes & `` Southern Harmony ... '' -RRB- . `` By Your Side '' is in a different vein than `` 3 Snakes '' as it is a lot more rockin ' . No one does the `` crunchy '' guitar like the Crowes & the vocals are great -LRB- even though the gospel-like backup singers get a little irritating on a track or two -RRB- . For me , this album sounded a lot like `` A Southern Harmony & Musical Companion '' -LRB- which was probably their best album -RRB- .
 I 'm not a long time diehard crowes fan . So I 'll save you the overly analytical , tooth comb review . Basically if they had more CD 's as consistant and well crafted as this one I would be that long time , diehard fan . Over the years they always had some great songs but I never found a disc that I liked the whole enough to buy . This is the best American rock album I 've heard in so long I almost forgot there was real rock n roll bands left anymore . Chris Robinson 's melodies are very focused and musical and the guitars and rhythm section are all meat . I read some of the reviews saying they missed the more loose , jammy feel from previous CD 's . I personally do n't think the Crowes do that too well -LRB- leave that to the Allman 's and Carlos -RRB- . I love that this CD is one strong `` song '' after another and they all are to the point without any unecessary fluf . The backup vocals in the gospel , R&B style give great counterpoint melodies to Chris 's lead vocal . Maybe all that matters is like the title of my review says . It has n't left my CD changer since I first put it in . When `` Horsehead '' starts your yugo turns into a GTO !! It melts blaring , stoplight hiphop at 20 yards baby ! If your sick of buying remastered 70 's favorites because there ai n't much happening in rock right now , check out this CD and it will renew your faith that there 's life after Bonham , Jones and Bolin ceased to be.P.S I refuse to accept that Appetite for Destruction was meant to be my generations rock revival .
 `` By Your Side '' offers a middle-ground between the meat-and-bones blues and rock 'n roll of their first two albums and the sophisticated songwriting and rhythms of `` Amorica . '' Thus , no matter which album is your favorite of the Crowes , chances are , you will enjoy this album . There is even a good helping of the psychedelic rock from `` Three Snakes and One Charm '' left over.Again , the Black Crowes go further to prove they are much more than a simple retro band . Bands like the Rolling Stones and the Faces are definitely huge influences , but has either band ever offered up such funky grooves , or rocked with such soul and energy , as the Crowes do on songs like the musicially inspiring `` Virtue and Vice , '' the groove-filled `` Then She Said My Name , '' or the angry `` HorseHead '' ? And could a simple retro band ever shake things up enough to write with the creativity displayed on the melodic and dreamy `` Welcome to the Goodtimes '' and the pure funk of `` Heavy '' ? Do n't kid yourselves
 despite some of the claims made in prior reviews , this is not their best cd . My guess is that those who say it is have only listened to SYMM . This cd picks up the pace for sure , it is good times rock n ' roll , but the lyrics in part are a little shallow , and the band is definitely missing front man marc ford , though Rich does an okay job with the lead guitar . Welcome to the Goodtimes , Virtue and Vice , Go faster , and Kickin my heart around make the cd well worth buying , but if you do n't have Amorica -LRB- dark and disturbing -RRB- , or Southern Harmony -LRB- the greatest rock album of the 90 's -RRB- , you are missing out . The lyrics and guitars on both are incredible .
 I have to admit I 'm a recent fan of the Black Crowes and `` By Your Side '' was their first complete album that I listened to , but not the last . Because of this I album I got everything that they have ever released and I have to say , this one is definately their best . From `` By Your side '' to `` Go Tell the Congregation to `` Virtue and Vice '' there is not a minute of music on this album that does not rock . I read a biography of the band at the Apple music store and that writer said it best , `` This album is Criminally Under-Rated '' . If you 're a Black Crowes fan then you 'll love this album .
 For starters , The Crowes are an amazing rock n ' roll band . Their music is more than welcome considering the severe absence of good rock n ' roll these days . As far as By Your Side goes , most people 's biggest criticism is that it is too polished . My response to this is that it is important to understand that once a band has been together for as long as these guys have , they naturally get tighter . I do n't think this should be mistaken for over-production or anything . And , personally I would not prefer a recording to be sloppy simply so I can say without a doubt that I have n't bought some nice , neat , corporate package . I 'd rather trust the musicians . The songcraft on this album is great . The melodies are strong and are not a mere regurgitation of anything else . The guitars are superb and well-driven . Additionally , there are alot of classic Crowe-isms , keeping an identifiable element of consistency with their other records . Also , you can listen to this album the whole way through ; every song is awesome . This album rocks , pure and simple , and is a must have .
 I absolutely loved this album when it came out . To me it was the most exciting thing we had heard from this great band in over 6 years . After the first two albums , I found `` Amorica '' too experimental and `` Three Snakes And a Charm '' a slight improvement but a bit slow in spots . This effort just gets back to basics -- both for the Crowes in particular and rock and roll in general.Sure , there are none of the understated drawn-out , experimental sounds that the music critics who hate melodic rock music like . And that 's what 's so great about it . I would n't want each of their albums to sound just like this , but at the time -LRB- a time when grunge was mercifully beginning to die but when boy bands were truly taking over the popular music universe -RRB- this release hit the spot . For sure , it still does . `` Kickin ' My Heart Around '' was the first single released -- and I was instantly pumped when I first heard it . A catchy , rocking song with attitude . The title track and `` Only A Fool '' were other tracks that I heard on the radio -- both very endearing anthems with great background vocals . Other standout tracks include the opener `` Go Faster '' , the closer `` Virtue and Vice '' , and `` Heavy '' . Just an amazingly catchy overall effort that is so refreshing to hear in this day and age . I like the Crowes ' latest album `` Lions '' almost as much , as it continues the interesting evolutionary process of this band 's music . But for sure , no rock album hit the spot more than this one at the time it came out .
 By Your Side - -LRB- 1999 -RRB- 11 Tracks **** -LRB- 44:56 -RRB- First of all , let me just say , I like this album . I like it better than Three Snakes and One Charm . Now a lot of people will disagree with me , as many people consider By Your Side one of the Black Crowes `` worst '' albums -LRB- I wonder what those people think of Lions ? -RRB- . Anyway , this album was a departure from the Black Crowes usual line-up as long-time guitarist Marc Ford left the band . Instead of replacing him , Rich Robinson just took up the task of playing all the guitar parts . I did n't really notice at first , but I later realized the usual nice guitar solos and slide guitar was not present . Also affecting the sound of this particular release was a new producer , Kevin Shirley.Well now , on to the music on this album
 I would give this 4 and a half stars . I had to write this review because of the reviews saying how bad the lyrics were . This album has some great lyrical songs especially `` Horsehead '' , I mean this is just great rock and roll , Southern Harmony is the album if you want great lyrics , but Chris Robinson is not Bob Dylan I think that is obvious , that should n't stop anyone from buying an album full of great music , and lyrics that are better than most bands out there anyway .
 The title track here simply soars to this listener 's ears . I did n't turn the volume below 9 until the 12th listen of track # 3 . I was extremely glad to hear the Crowes getting back to rockin ' blues , after the indifferent previous releases . When a song hits me as hard as `` By Your Side '' hits me , you 've got somethin ! And the rest of the disc is terrific too . `` Go tell the congregation '' and `` virtue & vice '' are certainly notable .
 This is an outstanding C.D. Starts really fast with the first 2 songs , and keeps a good pace all the way . Check out HEAVY , GO FASTER , GO TELL THE CONGREGATION ! Rocks hard and fast and some cool love songs too -LRB- not wimpy -RRB- A classic all around !
 Even if it 's not exactly what they 're old style was , who cares , the tracks on this album -LRB- 10/11 -RRB- simply rock . They 're other albums do n't get that kind of ratio . I just want to hear this one over and over again . Rates up there with the all time greats . Keep it up boys !
 Nearly every track is pumping , Black Crowes ' style
 After the southern rock album -LRB- `` Amorica '' -RRB- and the psychedelic album ? -LRB- `` Three Snakes And One Charm '' -RRB- , The Black Crowes return to their roots with an album of pure rock . There is a new bass player and brother Rich Robinson does all the guitar work after Marc Ford 's departure . `` By Your Side '' is closer to the beginnings of the band with quick Stones/Faces-influenced songs -LRB- Ca n't be the title track another `` Crazy Mama '' ? -RRB- . The result
 If you are sick of all the downtrodden and torn , if you are disgusted with all the depressing computers that are OK , or you are worn out by all the R&B crap flooding the airwaves , welcome to utopia . The Black Crowes , everyone 's bash on band , have managed to pull the old instrument called the guitar from the jaws of death and created a good old fashioned rock album . This long since irrelevent band with a loyal legion has finally given us our reward . Go Faster , Kickin ' My Heart Around , HorseHead , Heavy and Then She Said My Name drip , smack , and spurt soul . This collection of songs can only be described as toe-tappers . This disc speaks to the long forgotten collective of Party Rockers Anonymous . This album tells us that it is quite Ok to jam in the car , home or office . The world owes the Crowes a big ol' Southern fried thank you for pulling us from the bowels of anti-fun music hell .
 With By Your Side , the Crowes finally sound like the Crowes . Most of the album rocks with a nice steady pace and is really a joy to listen to . Worth the money to buy .
 There back ! I was never a huge Crowes fan , but this record rocks and is easily the best thing since Shake Your Moneymaker . A great record that makes you want to get up and move !

 After a few mediocre albums , the Black Crowes have recorded their best album . Yes , even better than their excellent 1990 debut , Shake Your Money Maker . From the first song , `` Go Faster , '' to the epic `` Virtue and Vice , '' this album rocks like I thought the Black Crowes would never rock again . It also the absolute best kick drum sound I have ever heard - big , tight and mixed WAY up front . By Your Side gets my vote for best rock album of 1999 .
 One of the last great southern rock bands is back , and in a big way ! By Your Side is a great cd which conveys the southern rock and roll styles that has been sorely missed for the past few years . This is true rock and roll at it 's finest . If you enjoy Aerosmith or the Rolling Stones , I recommend this cd . The first single `` Kickin My Heart Around '' sums up what the Crowes are about . They might not have the most talent in the world , but they are great at what they do , rock hard ! A must hear !
 This CD is filled with great tracks . As soon as I listened to it for the very first time , I could n't put it away . I need to listen to it more and more . This CD really grows on you . The open tracks are just AWESOME
 To all the ` drugged-out , post-hippie ' fans of the Black Crowes . . put down your doobies for a week or so and re-listen to this fabulous disc ! This is by FAR their best , albeit most ` commercial ' sounding release . Obviously , this is not what every fan of the band wanted from them . But if you enjoyed what they were trying to achieve on ` Shake Your Moneymaker ' , how can anyone deny the musical growth AND extremely catchy vibes of every single song on this masterpiece ?! Please do n't be put off from buying this because of the negative reviews . This is easily the Black Crowes I 'd have liked to have heard way more of . Sadly-they decided to climb back into ` obscurityland ` on their final disc , the somewhat lame ` Lions ' . What a HUGE disappointment after this gem ! Buy NOW & enjoy . .
 The only thing that disappointed me was the departure of Sven Pipein -LRB- bassist -RRB- , after the release of this album . Sven is one of the best bassists of all time . Nonetheless , this album is a MASTERPIECE !
 I ca n't see where the Crowes have missed a beat . This is the first Crowes album I have purchased since Southern ... . So if the band stumbled I missed it . I found most of the tracks , especially Horsehead , to be raw , sassy and in your face rock and roll . That is how I remembered the Crowes and I 'm happy that they followed their protocol on By Your Side . If you liked the Crowes first two releases then By Your Side is a wise musical investment .
 It is so nice to hear a band that can still deliver powerfull and musical rock riffs . I know nothing of the individuals in the band nor their history but I recoginize a great collection of songs on one CD when I hear it . As a bonus , it 's very well engineered .
 This is by far the best , most consistent album the Black Crowes ever did . The band plays as if it put down the dope for once and just rocked and played like it 's very existence depended upon it . I laughed at the one bad review on this site . It looks as though Marc Ford wrote it himself . Nice try , Marc !
 Band lineup changes and whether or not this was a blatant attempt at record sales aside , By Your Side is a logical attempt at correcting minor flaws on their preceeding album , Three Snakes and One Charm . Despite being a very good album , Three Snakes was slightly lacking in catchy hooks , so Rich Robinson wrote this collection of songs filled with loud , energetic guitar hooks.In accordance with the upbeat songs , singer Chris Robinson , sounding great , adds more uplifting lyrics than usual . Great songs such as the title track and closer Virtue and Vice have a positive outlook . Though the songs are consistently good , there is a feeling of sameness however as so many of the songs contain a fast beat with a loud , almost thumping snare drum . So , though it may not have the depth of earlier albums , By Your Side is a rock and roll record that 's overflowing with muscle and energy and there 's nothing wrong with that .
 A previous posting noted that there were only 2 bonus tracks ... do n't know which CD they have but the one I own has 4 bonus tracks . As far as By Your Side goes , I love that album -LRB- as I love all Crowes albums ... 5 stars all the way ! -RRB- and it 's a kickin ' record . That out of the way , on to the bonus 4-track disc.Track 1
 This album cooks ... this album had me re-visit the Crowes after not giving them a listen in ages . Really too bad they got screwed from their record company in the lack of promotion for this album . Damn shame.Old school fans will love it .
 I 'm a stuffed shirt who sits behind a desk plugging numbers into a computer . Yeah , it 's a fun life . But I do like my music . And this is one CD that gets me rockin ' in my chair to the point that I 'm singing out loud . So much for employee relations.I 've seen this group twice in concert . Once about ten years ago and then again within the last two years . The group has definitely evolved to become more polished , although some would say `` commercial . '' Frankly , I did n't enjoy the latter concert experience . In any case , this album still shows that the band is rooted in southern gospel and blues , with a heavy steroid dose of rock . More than this , the harmonies , the musicianship , and most importantly , the sheer energy make this a great album.Get it !
 I 'm surprised at some of the negative remarks about this album . For me , I started losing interest in this band with the release of Amorica . I did n't think it was anywhere near as good as their first two albums . The next album , Three Snakes and One Charm , was even worse.However , I think By Your Side is definitely as good as the band 's first two albums , and in some respects even better . The all-out rocker Go Faster kicks off the album in style and many other great tunes are on the CD . I kept this album in my car 's CD changer for months and never got tired of it .
 I love `` Kickin ' My Heart Around '' . Finally they are in a class by themselves.Too bad this album is currently being ignored by `` radio '' . Do I recommend you buy this ? You bet.And play it loud !
 After going to more shows I am convinced this band kicks ass . After more listens this album has become my favorite . Hidden Gems galore . Excellent CD .
 I have no problems with Klemperer 's tempi . If you 're an ` authentic guy ' , you should stop reading here . If you are looking for just one version of Beethoven 's symphonies , this is high quality at a low price , with 5 piano concertos & a few overtures thrown in for good measure - a classic but you have to know that the tempi are slower than , say , Karajan 's cycle . If you 're a collector of various cycles Beethoven 's symphonies , this is heaven ! Why ? Because it 's ` different ' . If you collect Beethoven symphony cycles , the last thing you want is your different cycles to sound alike .
 Otto Klemperer ... I admire him very much . Because , he conducted and performed the music just it should be , in the manner directly of composer . He did n't add his personal feelings to music , like Karajan . He just interpreted in the way , how it must be . And his majestic , grand character directly touches the soul of the listener.Especially , in Beethoven and Mahler -LRB- who personally know him -RRB- , he is really referance . In that box-set , you will find the darkest , most noble , unsentimental but so deep , most philosophic readings of the Beethoven Symphonies . Klemperer , as you know , sometimes takes the tempi slower than normal , but because of the all notes must be heared cleanly and the all notes must have an meaningful expression . You will impressed especially when you listen 3 -LRB- Eroica -RRB- , 5 and of course 9th Sym . By the way , this set includes so impressive Leonore No. 3 and dramatic Coriolan Overtures , they are really worth to listen and experience the majesty of Klemperer.By the way , Piano Concertos are very good too . Barenboim is a good pianist , who have a very beautiful color when he 's playing . He has a deep character too , but everyone is not love always his performances . OK , he is not Wilhelm Kempff , but anyway , he is a great musician.But , you should buy that , especially for Klemperer 's performances of Symphonies . Highly recommended .
 My first Beethoven was the Bruno Walter / ? Chicago Symphony series on Columbia Records . I have acquired several versions of my favorites since . The Emmanual Ax version on RCA of the Emporer and the Fantasia are very good . The Wolfgang Sawallisch version of the Pastoral Symphony is one of my favorites . Having said all that , if I could only have one set , it would be this one . ` Slow ' ? Maybe . But you can hear every note , every phrase , clearly and beautifully . I have the Wilhelm Kempff versions of four of the piano sonatas , which are technically brilliant , and very fast . Not until I got Murray Perahia 's version of ` Moonlight ' did I really hear everything that 's in there ! Same thing applies here . Use these versions as a solid wonderful ` gold standard ' , and explore from there .
 I 've just lately been revisiting these Klemperer offerings . While they might not be everyone 's ideal Beethoven , theygrow on you after several listenings . A really outstanding feature -- I 've just recently listened to the 1st and the 6th -- isthe beautiful clarity and spaciousness of the recording , something that adds much to the enjoyment of these works . `` Hearing anew `` definitely applies here , I think.I 've heard all of the symphonies live over the years , but I have to say I 'm totally taken by these recordings , mainly becausethey sound so terrific , even on an iPod ; it 's like having a fabulous concert hall in your head . Really .
 Otto Klemperer was one of the greatest conductors and Beethoven interpreters the world has ever known.This set is as complete as you could get . It 's got just about every major orchestral work by Beethoven , superbly recorded and magisterially interpreted .
 Klemperer 's Beethoven symphonies are phenomenal . I think the many reviewers before me have done a good job to convey this , but I could not pass up on giving this an extra 5 star rating .
 This collection is a must have . Each symphony is performed with perfect skill and emotion such that I could listen to this collection 100 times and not tire of it . Each of the 9 symphonys and 5 piano concertos come with their history and storry . This is the easiest and , I think , the best wat to collect the music that made Beethoven one of the most famous amd celebrated composers of all time .
 I bought symphony No. 5 and 9 a century ago . I recently bought the complete symphonies and piano concertos . My favorite is symphony No. 9 , which I listen days and nights . When I am ready for bed , I turn it on and listen until I fall asleep . I have a good night sleep when I listen to one of my favorite composers .
 For anybody wanting a complete collection of Beethoven 's symphonies this is probably the best place to start . I find that all of the symphonies on these CDs are excellent portrayed . Of course , once you get to know and love each symphony you will probably want to buy individual recordings of each one . This box set is amazing value , not just for sheer content , do n't forget you get the concertos as well , but the quality is top notch.Upon seeing the price I was a little dubious that there would be the odd poor version , especially the 5th symphony , as that tends to be on so many compilations and most often a very poor performance is used . However , the performance contained here is of high class , for me it is just the right tempo to show it off in all its triumph.My personal favourite , the 9th symphony , also did n't disappoint . I 'm biased , as I love it so much , but this is the highlight of the collection . The conductor and the orchestra do a fantastic job of capturing all the right emotions involved and all the vocal performers are spot on throughout the final movement . It is as every bit as good as my other favourite recordings , which is very good for one included on a low budget box set.The only niggle I have is with the 5th piano concerto , the `` emperor '' . To me this is not how it should be played , the melody and even the mood is somewhat different to how I prefer it.To summarise , if you dont know much about these pieces and want a nice cheap set to hear them , you can not do any better than this . If you know these pieces but can not afford individual recordings of each one then , again , this collection will not disappoint.Great quality , great quantity and great price .
 I have admittedly not made it through the entire set as of yet , but feel sufficiently blown away by the First Symphony and the Eroica - particularly the second movement of the latter - to weigh in here . With respect to the tempo issue , I must - at least so far - argue in favor of Klemperer 's decision to slow things down a bit . I think the effect is , as someone else has observed , a clearer and more visceral experience of Beethoven 's composition . It brings out the feeling . The sound comes up a little short on the low end , but it is n't a major distraction . My only problem lies in EMI 's inexplicable lack of any discussion of the performances . The notes are bland , dry descriptions of the pieces themselves , with some basic history thrown in . Given the fact that there are probably hundreds of different CDs of Beethoven 's symphonies out there , all with similar explanatory notes , it is infuriating that nothing is said about these particular performances . This is in contrast with the EMI Bach set -LRB- with Yehudi Menuhin -RRB- in which there is a wonderful essay that discusses Menuhin 's work in historical context .
 The people who are criticizing Klemperer 's tempo are missing the big picture . Listening to these recordings was powerful and moving . Klemperer uses tempo to give the listener the oportunity to hear each note that Beethoven used . Anybody who wants to hear a powerful interpertation of the great symphonies should buy this box set .
 In Ms. Quinn 's review of this Klemperer Beethoven set , she refers to Bruno Walter 's Beethoven symphony set on Columbia , which she describes as done with the '' ? Chicago Symphony '' . I believe she 's referring to the late 1950s Columbia/Walter stereo set made in LA with the `` Columbia Symphony '' , a pickup orchestra of LA `` s best studio musicians . Columbia 's producer assembled that orchestra specifically for Dr. Walter , thereby giving that great conductor an opportunity to record what turned out to be his last thoughts on Beethoven , Brahms , and others . I believe this Walter set deserves to be placed alongside Klemperer 's , von Karajan 's -LRB- 1962 series -RRB- , and Toscanini 's -LRB- 1949-1952 series -RRB- as an exemplar of surpassingly great Beethoven performances . I grew up with the Toscanini set and still listen to it -- but there is no one way of playing these symphonies.To give just one example
 There are many different ways to perform Beethoven and each one is valid.If you like it fast - go to Toscanini or Norrington . If you prefer slow , powerful and majestic , this is your set . Towards the end of his distinguished career , the great Otto Klemperer set down his final views of the performance of these symphonnies . The set is a coherent whole and will give great pleasure for ever . The challenging mix of the young Barenboim and the aged Klemperer worked surprisingly well and thus the concertos may also be recommended . There are odd additional items which add to the pleasure . Finally do not forget to purchase his memorable set of ` Fidelio ' to complete your traversal of a great conductor giving great performances of a composer that he loved . Finally the price is ridiculously low and provides quality and quantity at a great price . Thus you should be able to buy the opera set from the savings made !
 '' Old fashioned and slow ? `` I ca n't believe your music editor is talking this kind of a language . Klemperer is the high priest of Beethoven and he chose his tempo according to what he felt was right.I for one can never understand why people equate Klemperer to slow tempos . They should listen to Klemperer 's readings of Bruckner 's 4th or to Mozart 's ` Prague ' symphony where he decides to use faster than normal tempos.This set will remain an all-time classic !
 This review will , without doubt , irritate musicologists immensely . Good . I 'm in that large group who ca n't read a note of music , but know what they like . My claim to expertise is a 50-year love affair with Beethoven and his symphonies . I 've heard everything from Furtwangler to -LRB- heaven help us -RRB- Gardiner . I have Klemperer 's vinyl version of the 4th -LRB- along with the Consecration of the House -RRB- - an amazing recording which I hope will eventually be re-produced on CD . As soon as I saw `` dark '' and `` slow '' , I knew I had to have this collection . I 've just run through my favourites and am delighted with the purchase . I do agree that some of the tempi are a bit brisk ; one example , unfortunately , being the Allegretto in the Sixth . So far , the Seventh and his collaboration with Barenboim on the Fifth Piano Concerto are the best I 've heard . These two performances alone are worth the price of the set . They are suitably slow , decidedly not dark , but majestic in every sense of the word . If you like your Beethoven symphonies full , lush and grand , this compilation is well worth your attention . The ONLY conductor to equal Klemperer 's treatment of these works is Carlo Maria Giulini -LRB- aside from occasional offerings from Monteux and Karajan -RRB- . Get his Sony recordings of the 3rd , 6th and 7th symphonies if you can ... meanwhile , this batch will do very nicely ! One word of warning
 Otto Klemperer conducts the definitive performances of the Beethoven symphonies . The transition of the original recordings to a modern digitalized format is itself beautifully crafted so that each layer of the orchestra is given its own unique setting and place . An outstanding production of this supreme musical and cultural artifact .
 For me , this is the top choice for stereo Beethoven cycles . Klemperer conducted with a grandeur that is sadly not to be found among today 's conductor 's . His `` Eroica '' is still among the best around alongside Furtwangler , Abendroth & Weingartner . His 9th is easily a top 10 choice , behind a couple by Furtwangler , Weingartner , Reiner and perhaps Bohm and Fricsay . The rest of the set is also very solid , especially 4 and 6 -LRB- one of the very best , after Walter and Bohm -RRB- without a subpar performance in the bunch . As an added bonus , you get an above average set of the piano concertos by Barenboim and Klemperer , although not the quality of Fleisher/Szell , Kovacevich/Davis or Kempff/Van Kempen . When you factor in the cost -LRB- You can usually find it for under $ 40 -RRB- this great set is a steal . The best alternative for a complete set of symphonies and concertos is Szell 's with Fleisher accompanying on the concertos .
 I love these Klemperer Beethoven recordings but considering the number of times EMI has repackaged this material , it is hard to believe they still have n't gotten it right . There is no reason why Klemperer 's performance of the Violin Concerto with Yehudi Menuhin -LRB- currently out-of-print stateside -RRB- , his accounts of the King Stephen , Fidelio and Consecration of the House Overtures , and the Egmont Incidental Music -LRB- the latter four available on a title in the Klemperer Legacy series -RRB- could not have been included in this box set . By my count , the majority of this material could have fit on a 10th disc , and the remainder surely could have been squeezed on one of the existing nine CDs . This is a fine set as is , but it could have been perfect .
 This music lifts itself an dthe movie to a higher level . Only listening brings you in the movie . One to have
 How best to describe Otto Klemperer 's perspective on Beethoven 's symphonies
 When I read such comments as `` hopelessly old-fashioned , dark , heavy , and frequently very slow , '' I ca n't believe your reviewersheard the same recordings I did . This nine-CD album is anastonishing achievement and a wonderful contribution to therecording legacy of Otto Klemperer and the Philharmonia -LRB- or NewPhilharmonia after 1964 -RRB- . Any lover of classical music shouldimmediately order this set while it is still in the catalog.Please ignore the carping by some critics that Klemperer indulgesin `` impossibly slow tempos . '' These people ignore the fact thatKlemperer often delivers quite brisk tempi when it suits hisinterpretation of the score . Perhaps such critics prefer tohear every classical piece performed at precisely the metronomesetting they feel matches the tempo markings of the composer , butthat could result in every recording of a work sounding the same.Klemperer was a maestro who knew what he wanted , and he made surehis orchestra knew it as well . His output with the Philharmoniaand New Philharmonia included numerous major works ranked byprominent critics as among the `` great recordings of all time . `` Sure , there are other conductors with faster , even MUCH faster , versions of the Beethoven symphonies and concerti and overtures.Sir Georg Solti and William Steinberg come to mind , and somecritics hated their performances for being TOO fast . But thereare others even slower than Klemperer 's slowest passages . I havenumerous versions of the Beethoven symphonies and piano concerti -LRB- LP and CD -RRB- in my collection , and I enjoy the differences inapproach of such conductors as Solti , Ashkenazy , Karajan , Boehm , Kleiber , Furtwangler , Toscanini , Monteux , Stokowski , and others , even when accompanied by groans , moans , and occasional editingof the scores . But I challenge anybody to identify a moremajestic set of Beethoven symphonies and concerti than thisKlemperer album . I want especially to compliment the five pianoconcerti -LRB- featuring Daniel Barenboim as soloist -RRB- . The sound ofthese performances is markedly superior to the original vinylrecords , and the tempi are definitely not a drag . Add to thatthe inclusion of the three Leonore overtures and the variousother pieces , and you have an amazing value as well as superbperformances . The only things I would have liked to add are theViolin Concerto -LRB- with Yehudi Menuhin as soloist -RRB- and the Fideliooverture . Incidentally , for those enthusiasts of vinyl records , let me add that the CD sound -LRB- remastered with 24-bit technology -RRB- is every bit as good , and often better than those Angel records , and there are no unfortunate breaks in movements , such as in thesecond movement of the Angel LP of the `` Eroica '' symphony .
 Two days after 9-11 , in a stunned state -LRB- as we all were here in New England -RRB- I sat down at a local used CD shop and almost absent-mindedly plunked into the player a used copy of Klemperer 's recording of the Third . I was barely aware of the passing of the first movement but when the Funeral March began something extraordinary happened . It was n't the Funeral March per se -LRB- which would have struck me as trite during those days of bottomless tragedy -RRB- but this recording of it . Klemp , a German , and a damned good one , understood . He 'd seen it , in fact he 'd seen worse , much worse . He was almost using Beethoven 's music to convey something no composer could ever convey.Klemperer 's way with music , especially German music , was unique . Issues of tempo and `` control '' are superfluous , he was a deeply soulful conductor and that 's what matters . Soulfulness , in case you have n't noticed , is the magic elixer that makes Germanic music truly come alive and I 'd argue only German conductors , and especially those of an era when good German souls were in deep torment , are best qualified to wrench every bit of it out of a piece of music . No man who was a German could stand at a podium in , say , 1958 , conduct the Ninth , or Mathis der Maler , or the St Matthew Passion , and not feel a bit of the cosmos orbiting around the proceedings , and not exactly in a pleasant way . This often was n't mere music making , it was penance , it was offerings to God for forgiveness , compassion , understanding . It may be that the greatest tragedy of modern times may have , ironically , led to two or three decades of the greatest music making ever.I love quite a few Beethoven cycles -LRB- most though are pre-Seventies -RRB- but this set is special . Please accept it on its own terms and please accept the total committment and sincerity of the conductor .
 To own these recordings ; what a privilege!These are to me , without a doubt the most convincing and satisfying accounts of these most eternal symphonic works ever committed to disc.Without wanting to slaughter this gift by detaining it for analysis , yet there are two characteristic traits worthy of mention to the ardent devotee of Beethoven 's works
 Klemperer 's way with Beethoven is nothing if not honest . By the 1950 's Otto Klemperer drew his written signature with a bold , truculent hand , the letters shaky but defiant . He had endured much . That signature and these Beethoven performances reveal the same spirit - an essential honesty.These are bold , defiant , trenchant and experienced performances . They represent essential aspects of Beethoven 's genius . Dylan Thomas 's pleaded that his father should ` rage against the dying of the light ' . Beethoven did so . So too did Klemeperer . He rages through these symphonies . Despising superficiality , he scorned a polished , refined orchestral sound . The Philharmonia respond with bold , rugged , trenchant strength . The conductor 's hand and beat were in the last years notoriously shaky but the spirit utterly secure , defiant in adversity.Klemperer 's vision is expressed with a defiant , trudging gait , firmly grasped priorities , unbending pride , prominent woodwind , violins divided right and left , thundering timpani in Eroica 's the last page , blazing trombones in the finale of the 5th , a galumphing rustic peasant dance in the ` Pastoral ' -LRB- Klemperer insisted this was a slow Austrian county dance -RRB- . It is fashionable to prefer early versions of the 3rd , 5th and 7th and the ` live ' recording of the 9th but the recordings included in this set are quintessential Klemeperer . They represent something elemental , undeniable . Comparison with Klemperer 's contemporaries uncovers fundamental differences of personality . Klemperer lacks the beauty and grace of Bruno Walter 's vision ; the deep peace and equilibrium radiating from Ferencsik 's pacific performances ; the athletic dynamism that drives Carl Schuricht 's . But Klemeperer convinces by patent honesty , stubborn faithfulness to essential aspects in the physiognomy of Beethoven 's spirit . Indispensable !
 What is the best value in classical discs available today ? Who knows , but I defy anyone to beat the EMI compilation of Klemperer ' recordings of the complete Beethoven Symphonies , Piano Concertos -LRB- with Barenboim -RRB- , several overtures the Choral Fantasia etc etc. 9 discs for only $ 44 -LRB- well that was the price I paid -RRB- . You have got to be kidding ... I only had two concerns with buying this . First on the age of the recordings , all more than 40 years old . No worry at all . This is a masterpiece of reconstruction . The sound quality indistinguishable from any modern recording . Secondly , the performances themselves . I had been warned that Klemperer notoriously chose rather slow tempi . Again I need n't have worried . I immediately went to the slow movements of the 2nd piano concerto and the fourth symphony , where many slow tempists have in the past come unstuck . The piano concerto was an absolute revelation . The combination of the youthful Barenboim and the Philharmonia 's masterful playing time and gain had me on the edge of my seat . '' Yes , go on , well ... '' Slow it may have been . Boring , never . The same applies in spades to the slow movement of the fourth . Right from the eerie opening , which is yes , very slow indeed , I knew this movement would be a revelation and I can honestly say I have never hear it better played . Follow this with a scherzo bounding in energy and thumping finale and you will never get a better performance of this , one of Beethoven 's `` lesser '' symphonies . And I have n't even got round to the `` biggies '' yet ! The box set looks unattractive and the portrait of Klemperer makes him appear a first class nerd . Pay absolutely no attention to this ...
 I 'll honestly admit I was a Klemperer-skeptic for a long time . A few months ago I became hooked on his supreme intellect and insight and his meticulous detail in phrasing and clarity.As with all recordings of Klemperer this one is not a winner at first hearing . But after repeated listening it dug into my mind and never left there and I can not imagine a life without this set.The thing with Klemperer is that he was a conductor who values certain aspects of music -LRB- clarity , detail of phrasing , architectural insight and logic -RRB- which simply not all listeners appreciate . I do love this kind of music making and hence this is -LRB- together with the still underrated Szell cycle -RRB- my favorite set , even though it is not as immediately attractive or pleasing as certain others . Klemperer has always been a musician rather than an entertainer . He is the one to go to for musical truth rather than immediate thrills.However , once one has taken the effort of getting to know his recordings you will notice that it becomes all the more thrilling in it 's depths and in the myriad details he has to offer.Moreover , it 's one of the rare cycles with the violins placed antiphonically , something which greatly adds to my orchestral enjoyment.Don ' t live without this set if you value the qualities I mentioned . If you like your Beethoven different then feel free to ignore it and look for another conductor .
 Probably , a Beethoven symphony set can not be more seminal than this one . Klemperer 's gritty , powerful , and solid interpretations are classic benchmarks in the recording history.There are many things to appreciate here , for example the outstanding finale of no. 9 , with prominent trombone playing and excellent percussion beats - it sounds like no other recording , and I think it is the finest account available.In sum , a set carved in granite , heated by a sunny day of musical passion - warmly recommended . -LRB- The piano concertos included are also very fine , but consider Szell/Fleisher for reference . -RRB-
 These are classic , fine performances of the Beethoven symphonic and piano concerto canon by one of the great artists of the 20th century . They are not necessarily the most passionate or electrifying of Klemperer 's recorded legacy ; those belong to many of the live performances recorded from the early 1950 's through the early 1960 's . So why get this set -LRB- besides the price , which is a steal -RRB- ? The answer is that these are by far the best recorded of Klemperer 's Beethoven performances and showcase his extraordinarily meticulous attention to balance , phrasing and dynamics . Always present is the nearly unique command of long-term tension and release , the command of the structure of each symphony or concerto as a whole , and the innate sense of musical drama which makes his performances so satisfying . The Philharmonia is ideally suited to Klemperer 's vision , with its sure-footed brass , solo-quality first-chair winds and elegant but light strings . Klemperer may not have cared particularly about orchestral sound - his was most often called granitic -- but the results are certainly beautiful . And the recorded sound allows us to hear all of this . EMI lavished its skills on these recordings , making them in the marvelous acoustics of Kingsway hall ; they sound warm , detailed and natural.Klemperer 's vision of Beethoven is powerful and uncompromising . Yes , the tempi are slow in the faster movements , but there is a fierce intelligence and indominable spirit that radiates through these performances and makes them towering and , at their best , earth-shaking . Klemperer had a special affinity for Beethoven . Both men 's lives were compromised by chronic health issues and pain
 I 'm going to start this by quoting one of the reviewers below -LRB- dklotusjuggalo ... whose original review apparently got deleted -RRB- , who hit the nail right on the head with this comment ... `` Of course , not everything has to be wicked , but after `` Shangri-La '' AND `` The Calm '' AND `` The People , '' I think the Juggalos are ready to go back to the Wicked Shxt , not J singing over a piano . '' Right on brother . And that 's exactly what I was thinking before even purchasing this album . I 've been a juggalo since 1997 and I still consider Riddlebox and Milenko my favorite ICP albums . They were not only the pinnacle of the wicked shxt , but also contained originality , great story telling , and production that was right on par with the carnival/horror theme.Since then , there has been lots of material that I have still liked from ICP , but nothing that I would consider to be as good as the time frame from Ringmaster to Milenko . The Amazing Jeckle Brothers was a very good album ... Bizaar/Bizzar was mediocre , but still had some redeeming qualities ... Shangri-La was the first time that I felt ICP really let me down with an album ... Hells Pit was an improvement , but still nowhere near the quality of the old stuff ... and The Calm had a few good tracks , but it seemed like something that should be given away for free on the Internet rather than being justified as an actual release.That being said , obviously my expectations were n't through the roof for The Tempest . I realize that ICP will never be like they were back in the day and I also do n't want to be one of these juggalos that just complains that the music `` does n't sound like it used to , '' because I realize that artists are always going to branch into new territory and experiment with new sounds ... plus nobody wants a carbon-copy of their old material anyway . So I went into The Tempest with an open mind and I 'd have to say that this is favorite ICP record since Jeckle Brothers . Do some songs suck ? Yes . Did they abandon the happy/friendly garbage -LRB- a-la `` Homies '' -RRB- ? No ... but they also did n't make a whole album with tracks like that either . This is definitely an experimental album and about 2/3rds of the songs work . Here is my track-by-track breakdown :1 . The Sky is Falling - Just an intro , not worth rating .2 . Ride the Tempest - -LRB- A -RRB- - This reminds me of the old school . When I heard this it gave me that `` yes , they 're back '' feeling and it has the perfect carnival beat to get you pumped up for the album . Ca n't wait for them to open with this song on the Tempest tour ! 3 . Alley Rat - -LRB- C -RRB- - OK , so this song starts off good and I actually like the verses and production . But as soon as the chorus hits , the song is just ruined . I personally wish they would never rap about being `` scrubby '' ... lame . On a side note , that guitar/banjo noise in here sounds like something out of `` Desperado '' or another movie from the Rodriguez/Tarantino collection ... definitely my favorite part of the song .4 . Haunted Bumps - -LRB- B -RRB- - The key word in the song is `` bumps '' ... listen to this one in a good system and you wo n't be disappointed because the beat bangs ! The chorus is kind of catchy too , even though it does sound a little lazy . Only J raps on this one and he basically does a good job ... pretty good track overall .5 . Growing Again - -LRB- A - -RRB- - Listen to this one a few times before passing judgment because it definitely gets better after a couple spins . For me , this is an example of good `` happy '' ICP music . The beat is solid and the song just has a nice feel to it , even if the subject matter is a little cheesy . The chorus will grow on you like herpes .6 . Hum Drum Boogie - -LRB- D - -RRB- - This is the first track that falls completely flat . As the ninja below stated , Violent J should NOT sing ... if he does , it should be in moderation on a darker song . Everything about this one just sucks .7 . I Do This - -LRB- D + -RRB- - When I heard this as the first single , I got very worried . It 's `` Homies '' all over again with an equally `` non-heterosexual '' chorus . Songs like this are not why I listen to ICP . If Shangri-La is your favorite ICP album , you will probably love it though .8 . What About Now - -LRB- A + -RRB- - I love this song , straight up . The message is about how music used to mean something , but nowadays it just sucks . Great raps , great beat , great chorus . Not really classic ICP , but a great new sound .9 . Watch My Ride - -LRB- A + -RRB- - Another great tune . The first time I listened to this I thought to myself , `` Who actually asks somebody to watch their ride ? '' . But then I just suspended reality for a few minutes and enjoyed this song for what it was . Great beat , classic Psy chorus , and funny raps . Makes me think about Corey Haim in `` License to Drive '' for some odd reason .10 . News at 6 O'Clock - -LRB- A -RRB- - I like this one a lot too and the subject matter is perfect for J and Shaggy to work with . Extremely catchy chorus and it does have an old school feel to it . Shaggy outshines J on this song .11 . The Tower - -LRB- C + -RRB- - Many people seem to like to verses more than the chorus here , but for me it is the other way around . The chorus actually has a wicked feeling to it , where as the raps sound rushed and do n't have a polished sound . Just my opinion , but either way it 's not one of the album 's best .12 . The Party - -LRB- A - -RRB- - I love the scratching by DJ Clay and Shaggy and the production on this track is fantastic . It seems like Shaggy 's solo tracks w/o J are always awesome .13 . Bxtch I Lied - -LRB- B -RRB- - This is a standard funny ICP song . Overall I like it ... pretty creative chorus too .14 . Play My Song - -LRB- A - -RRB- - Here is another great track that grows on you after a few listens . The verses in this song are the closest thing to the old school wicked shxt on the whole album ... but the chorus is far from it . If the chorus was a little bit better , this had potential to be the best song on the album .15 . Mexico City - -LRB- C + -RRB- - Where do I start ? If you 're looking for something different , look no further . I do n't even really know what to say about this one because this just does n't seem like a sound or topic that ICP would ever touch . Rather than tell you what I do n't like , I 'll just say that it is original and keep it at that .16 . If I Was a Serial Killer - -LRB- C - -RRB- - This is worst `` juggalo anthem '' song that ICP has ever made . Once again , J should not sing ... especially like this . If you manage to make it through the first three minutes or so , the song does pick up some steam . Remember when ICP ended albums with classic songs like `` Pass Me By '' and `` I 'm Comin ' Home '' ? You wo n't find anything like that here . A disappointing ending to an album that should have gone out with a bang . And I ca n't imagine they would even attempt to perform this song live ... we 'll see!In conclusion , if you 're a juggalo you are going to buy this anyway , so who cares what I think . This is just one opinion from a long-time juggalo . No matter what ICP puts out on CD , I 'll always love them for their older material and concerts anyway ... not to mention the creation of the wicked underground ! Ca n't wait for the Tempest tour with Twiztid !!
 I know ICP has been gettin dissed a bit for this one , but I love it . I love music , all kinds of music , but the psychopathic family tops it all . Some people are saying a few of the tracks are too slow , but I dont think so . Sometimes it just makes them funnier . ICP doing a rock ballad -LRB- If I Was A Serial Killer -RRB- ? Hilarious . I always liked that they could do all types of music and do it well.I like News At 6 ` Oclock because its true , Alley Rat cause the bumps are great and its how I feel , Hum Drum Boogie cause I 'm a perv , and What About Now ? because the beat is just wonderful . I will agree it in not their wickedest , but I 've been down with the clowns since Ringmaster dropped , and there has never been a CD I did n't love .
 the only reason i gave this cd four stars instead of five is because they keep claiming they are going to have the next wickedest album out only to turn out being happy and cheery.now that i got that out of my system , i still liked this one a lot . it 's not sub par by any means because i liked the majority of all the songs on it -LRB- which i ca n't say for the majority of rap out there at this point . get back to old school rap please -RRB- the reason i love listening to ICP stuff is because they tell stories in all their music . no one seems to do that at this point , so that is why i stay down with the clown and proud of it.i just wish they would stop claiming to be extremely wicked when they only register as freddy kruger scary . so pick this album up , but discard the notion of it being wicked and you will enjoy it much more . oh yeah , and my favorite song off this album is one most juggalos are going to be like WTF , the song Growing Again . it 's just hillarious and extreme fantasy and not wicked at all . go figure . the tower is probably the most realistic serial killing song they have done in quite a while.oh yeah , and as a side note , go ahead and check out the Wraith remix albums . you get both disks in one nice little neat package -LRB- like bizzare/bizaare should have been -RRB- and most of the mixes ai n't half bad . from the way it looked , no one seemed to know about it , so enjoy .
 I 'm gon na start by saying ICP is growing ... Growing older , growing mature , reaching and experimenting with new tunes and effects , yet still keeping a bit of their horrorfying acts and diabolical and mischevious humour along with it . But along the years , their serious lyrics and emotional vibes on everyday life , the world around us , and relating to each and every one of us has been intensified since the early jokers cards . It defineteley shows their becoming more developed and realistic in their approach , and can carry out their humor and dark comic in a broader , attention-grabbing way.Anymore , I 'm seeing more and more of juggalos nowadays , ranging from the typical scuffed up street punks , to ghetto thugs , to people right out of the farmlands , suburbia , and even everyday teenagers and adults who hold respectable jobs . And I think they 're doing a damn fine job opening up the carnival doors and creating a unity between people who typically would n't have anything in common ... in an almost near `` Let 's Go All The Way '' feeling.And while I feel `` The Calm '' may have not been their best album , it defineteley was much better than alot of music I hear out there ... and it was defineteley a gateway into a promising future . I mean seriously , think about Beverly Kills , Dog Beats , and even Carnival of Carnage ... good alblums , but it was n't until Ring Master , Riddle Box , Milenko , and Jeckel brothers that the music really did take on a unbeleivably gripping and compelling tone and story . So I can see something forming here , and quickly ... . another series of masterpieces . For a new era and time.You have to give them credit for doing it on their own ... and what it 's done so far , it 's done well.With the post-Joker card generation and era , I think the new alblums still retain enough old , but really do a great job of travelling into a rather unknow future ... There 's no goal this time ... no 6 ` th card to reach ... any CD released now does n't have to follow a beaten path , and yet , while its interesting to see it pan out , its definetely going somewhere and thats why Juggalos and newcomers continue to listen ... it 's inspiring , and even off track , it still feels like it 's a whole if you want it to ... very well balanced.Mike E Clark is back , and you can even tell his style has changed for the new age , into a more serious approach , yet when you really sit down and listen to it , you know its still Mike E Clark , and it makes you feel right at home ... theres still enough old to fill the loathing inside for all the new.It 's unbeleivable that this group has outlasted all who have put them down , and have grown even better throughout the years , gaining not only strong bonds with other great artists , but the ability to stay strong and honest to the long time juggalos , but reach out to everyone who 's willing to listen on many other musical levels . `` The Tempest '' may take a couple minutes to get adjusted to the first time hearing it , but a couple tracks in and your hooked . . You know its defineteley worth the wait and contains all the pumped-up and epic ` isms that you 've come to know and want from ICP , while still kickin ' humour , and dark hate against the evil and greedy . It 's worth each and every of the 5 stars that amazon will let me rate it , plus a whole many more.I was fairly sure that the `` The Tempest '' was never actually going to be the name of the so-called `` Storm '' that was directly after `` The Calm '' , rather a piece of the what I beleive to be the `` storm '' series as accordingly it passes over the lands leaving deadly yet majestic devices from the pure and relentess power of the storm which cahnnels its energy into these constructions , officially as of now appears to consist of 3 `` known '' alblums -LRB- you find out about the alblum titled `` Eye of the Storm '' if you purchase this one , a smaller EP due out in June of this year -RRB- , and will indefinetely be many more than 3 in its entirety . I knew that this mammoth storm would produce something sinister and mysterious on its way , such as this ride , and if you listen closely , you can see it fits the tale perfectley ... in light of the storm , things arise ... deadly , but amusing contraptions that mortals just HAVE to play with , out of our own curiousity of the unknown ... and each who rides or interacts with anything that has come from the passing of this mighty storm will likely be doomed . And there in lies the the true devistation ... curiosity of thrill , fear and the fact that most are wreckless , careless and thoughtless about anything that may happen to them will eventually consume or kill you.That 's been my theory on how it will follow out , and as I 've mentioned , the `` Storm '' is still happening , more deadly and disturbing rides and vices will rise as the storm rips through the lands , and that only those who can face their own fears and respect the dangerous realities of life will survive , just like those who are smart enough to get out of town before the hurricane hits . It 's human interest in deadly things , and the all-to-soon fate that may follow if you snooze and abuse.It 's fresh , its f ` ed up , it 's inspiring , it 's here ... `` The Tempest '' , and its awesome.Do yourself a favor , do n't listen to anyone dissing it ... They 're either fad juggalos , trolls , or haters that have allways had something against ICP . Listen , and listen hard , and you wo n't be disappointed ... it 's ALL still there homies.MCL !
 Finally ICP 's new album THE TEMPEST is finally here , after all the delays and waiting . So with out further adue , here is my review . P.S. MIKE E CLARK returned to produce the whole album .1 . THE SKY IS FALLING-after a little intro before the song hits of an alarm going off to signl the storm , then a beat driven by a nice piano kicks in and ICP start doing their thing . Their flows on this on are a little switched up to fit the beat , but other than that their flows are on point . this song is basically introducing you to the cd .5 / 52 . RIDE THE TEMPEST-this song is off the chain mainly due to the to clowns who switch on and off with each other semlessly . This song is kinda bouncy and entergetic , and the beat is laced with a quick tempo . The verses are excellent an this track , this song is about what you see on the cover .5 / 53 . ALLEY RAT-the beat for this one is great , it kinda reminds me of some old 80 's stuff . Also the verses on this track are great , the flows from J & Shaggy are amazing . Also the hook for this track is great , I would love to see a video for this song . This could easily be a theme for all Juggalos & Juggaletes out there .5 / 54 . HAUNTED BUMPS-this track surprised me alot , mainly because it is such a creative take on a topic that all rappers rap about , systems . Basically this track is about how the supernatural are responsable for J 's amazing system . J kills this track with a killer flow , and the beat is perfect for all speakers out there .5 / 55 . GROWING AGAIN-this is one of my favorite tracks on the album , the concept for this song is great . J is constantly growing while Shaggy stays the same size . J and Shaggs do a great job on this song the story they tell is great , and the beat from Mike E Clark is great , the guitar during the hook is great . I recommend this song to every body out there .5 / 56 . HUM DRUM BOOGIE-this is one of those funny little sex songs that ICP has been known for . This one in particular is great , this is another favorite of mine . the beat for this song fits the fun style of the song really well . this is another great track .5 / 57 . I DO THIS ! - i ` am not sure but i think this is a single for the album , and rightfully so . The hits just keep on coming one after the other , this is defenintly a fav of mine . this track in fact may be my favorite song on the album . The guitar influenced beat from Clark is excellent and of course J and Shaggy come more then correct on the verses . i ca n't compliment this song enough , this is one of their best .5 / 58 . WHAT ABOUT NOW ? - this is a track that all of the game needs , this track is basically about how about `` everything was so much fresher in the past '' to quote another Psychopathic release and that everything now a days is just rip offs of the past . This track is more then worthy of listening to .5 / 59 . WATCH MY RIDE-this track has a hard instrumental and a funny concept behind it . It is about people who are so cocky and concieted that they actually tell somebody to watch their ride for them . So you know that ICP is not down for that . Shaggy plays the regular guy and J is the car owner , this is a funny track .5 / 510 . NEWS AT 6 O ' CLOCK - this track is about how the worst show on tv is the news because all they show and talk about is bad things . the beat is nice and the flows are on point as well on this track .5 / 511 . THE TOWER-this track is amazing , mainly because that is what happened here in Texas at UT in Austin . So this story is real reconizable to me , and the lyrics are great . Also the beat from Clark is dark and amazing , this track is a classic for sure .5 / 512 . THE PARTY-this track has a nice bouncy yet hard beat to it , and a nice story behind it . This track is all about Shaggy going to a party and challanging the dj to cuting contest , Shaggs cuts on this track are great . This is another highlight to the album .5 / 513 . B ** CH I LIED-this is another funny track from the Clowns , this track is about J just straight lying to this girl just to get some . And even while he 's with her lies about all these things , another great track .5 / 514 . PLAY MY SONG-this track has a menacing beat to it from Mike E Clark , and some great lyrics from the Clowns . This track will be perfect listening for all those aching for some wicked stuff , another banger .5 / 515 . MEXICO CITY-this track is about how they are on the run from the law so they hit the border down south and make their way to Mexico city . The verses are great and the slow thumping beat from Clark is great . This is another banger for all you out there .5 / 516 . IF I WAS A SERIAL KILLER-this is one of the best songs on the album and a great way to end the album , this is a classic from the Clowns . J does his singing thing over a great smooth sounding piano , and Shaggy raps over this amazing track . The beat for this track is amazing , Mike E CLark out did himself on this one . Plus the ending chourus is amazing , this is a great Juggulo theme song . This was the perfect way to end the album . `` CHOPPING 'EM DOWN '' classic . 5/5This album in my opinion is a classic , I really enjoyed this album . Mainly because it was really creative and very diffrent from most of their other stuff.ENJOY JUGGULOS & JUGGELETS
 Very solid yet different release by the Clowns this time around . No more Joker Cards to keep you guessing what 's next , just The Tempest that thankfully is way better than The Calm . Now that Mike Clark is back on the boards , the wicked ones are noticeably back at home . This one is filled with songs that are sure to make anyone 's head bob .
 icp for the most part has disappointed me in the past with the releases of abk , amb and Esham . but i have to say this album is up there with the Jeckel Brothers era .
 Now , all you haters of this album , come on if you do n't like it then you 're not a real juggalo . Mike E. Clark provides ICP with some different funk and sounds , it 's got it all-the wicked rhymes , the happy rhymes , the storytelling , tight beats , rock beats , and shaggy scratching it up . It 's another classic in ICP 's catalog !!! I 'm going to the show in Norfolk at the end of May biatches it 's gon be tight!Tightest Tempety Temp Tracks : - Ride the Tempest-I DO This-Haunted Bumps-The Tower-The Party-Play My Song-The Sky Is Falling-Mexico City
 Im not a prolific writer and wo n't go into alot of detail , the other reviews already covered alot of my feelings -LRB- Growing again is the shxt , Hum Drum Boogie and Mexico City could have been cut but are still good -RRB- Basically , if you 're even reading these chances are you have a few of ICP 's CD 's already , and you WILL want this one too . I was not dissapointed in the least , and if `` youz a juggalo '' you wo n't be either .
 So here we FINALLY are with the long-awaited , first full-length album from the Insane Clown Posse since the dropping of the final Joker 's Card ! -LRB- Sometimes I wonder why ICP even announces street dates for their albums . -RRB- Not many Juggalos were thrilled with `` The Calm '' , myself included . Many were wondering if Psychopathic Records was a sinking ship ... so now that the Calm before the storm has passed , how devastating and wicked is the storm ? And was it worth the extra waiting?I was first inclined to give `` The Tempest '' 3 stars . This is partly the fault of the Wicked Clowns . They have been hyping the devastation and terror that `` The Tempest '' was supposed to be bringing . Many -LRB- myself included -RRB- were disappointed with `` Hell 's Pit . '' Although it was not garbage -LRB- It did have some hot tracks on it -RRB- , it was NOT the wickedest album ever . `` The Calm '' was forgettable , and for many , `` The Tempest '' was supposed to be the return of the Wicked Shxt.But if you 're waiting for ICP to put out the wickedest , hardest music they 've done in a long time ... you 're gon na have to keep on waiting . The Tempest is NOT a devastating storm or a tsunami . It is a rollercoaster ride . -LRB- See the cover -RRB- And it 's fitting , because the album is more of a rollercoaster ride -LRB- ups and downs -RRB- than a ferocious storm of wickedness . `` The Amazing Jeckel Bros. '' is a much harder album than this one is . But I wanted to judge it on its own , so I decided to give it a few more spins before passing judgement.And I 'm glad I did . I 'm an old-school Juggalo -LRB- prolly since right before Jeckel Bros. , I have all the Psy-related cds and dvds , been to all the Gatherings but 2 , countless shows and in-stores , many Hallowickeds , Big Ballas , etc. -RRB- , so the album grew on me quickly . The Clowns go solo on this one
 Well ICP or Inner city players are doing it agian with their muzic . This cd is a combo or rap , blues , reggie and soul . I personaly love the song I do this ! It is a song that relates what it is like to sell your body for crack . They even go into details about their homosexual love life with a young boy named fresco . I Love this CD !!!!!
 This cd is ridiculously awesome in so many ways , but not what I expected . If you follow ICP as of late you have to expect the unexpected . Nonetheless , The Tempest will peel your wig back with its gale force winds , never to be seen again . So do n't look back!It starts out with Violent J & Shaggy floating down to earth on tornados during a devastating storm . . a Tempest , if you will . When they fall to earth they gather everyone to go for a spin on the largest , fastest , tallest , steepest , and most horrifically fabulous roller coaster ride on this . . or any other planet !!! And so begins The Tempest . Flat out , this album is AWESOME ! This is the first full-length album from ICP since ending their infamous Joker Cards Saga in 2004 . So experimentation is to be expected , but with a twist and an old friend by the name of Mike E. Clark to add to the mix . To a Juggalo , saying that ICP is putting out a new album with Mike Clark is a dream come true . It 's been 7 years since Bizaar/Bizzar dropped , so Juggalos have been waiting for this moment for years.If you do n't like it , give it another listen , it 'll grow on you.Free Stuff Inside The CD Case : Ad for SLAM ! TV -LRB- JCW on the Internet -RRB- Ad for WF-OFF Radio -LRB- Psychopathic Records Internet Radio Station -RRB- Ad for The Eye of The Storm !!! -LRB- All new 6-track ICP EP due out this summer -RRB- Foldout Poster with lyrics to the Entire Album ! -LRB- First time ever for ICP -RRB- Only Cons : They do n't say the word `` Juggalo '' on the entire album.I think Hum Drum Boogie & Mexico City would have been better on a future Forgotten Freshness album than The Tempest.Other than that , The Tempest is another Masterpiece from The Wicked Clowns & Mike E. Clark.You ! Run ! Everybody Run !
 I have been listening to ICP for 9 years and I have been really dissapointed with their past few releases . When I heard they were getting back with their old producer , I was suddenly excited to hear a new ICP album for the first time in a few years.Overall , I think this is probably the best ICP album since The Amazing Jeckel Brothers . Bizaar/Bizzar had a few good songs , but I absolutely could n't stand The Wraith Shangri-la , Hells Pit , or The Calm . I have no idea why they ever got rid of Mike Clark to begin with , but The Tempest obviously shows that Mike Clark is clearly needed to make a decent ICP album . The majority of the songs on this album are great , but I am giving it 4 stars because there were a few songs they really should have done without . But this is The Wraith done right . If they had released this as the 6th joker 's card instead , I would have been much happier .
 This cd had a new sound to it i thought , they kept it icp in another style and i mean with how many cds they have had its nice to hear they can do a different sound and make it sound fresh . . pick it up , and be a little open minded about it and you 'll like it a lot .
 Mike Clark is back on this disc , and his presence is felt . I love this disc , one of their best in years .
 This is a feel good album that is so creative . The sound is excellent . The beats are very unique . This is one of my favorite album -LRB- top 3 -RRB- . They have grown up a little yet kept it clownish . This album is perfect . Drop your expectations for violence and ghetto freakshows and listen to it for what it is . This takes more talent which they come with . I can not express how happy I was to hear something like this . When I hear music , I want to hear something new and fresh ... . that 's what this is ... only better . Props to my homies J and Shaggs .
 The Insane Clown Posse return for their 10th studio album . And it definitely lives up to its hype and some . It 's a real roller-coaster ride -LRB- pun intended -RRB- . On this album , we hear a side of the Insane Clown Posse we have never heard before . Their new style is something I could easily get used to . It 's alot more industrial and heavier than anything they 've released in previous years . It flows extremely well . Although I was skeptical , because I thought it was gon na get caught in the nearly-abscent concept that `` The Calm '' had , but I put that aside and went into this superior masterpiece . Nearly every track is flawless.Violent J 's raps alone make this album worthwhile . Once again , he is decreasing as a storytelling rapper and developing as an underground emcee . His flow is improving alot lately , as well as his rhymes . I 'm sure he could flow with the best of them . He sings a little on here as well , his singing is n't bad , but I prefer his vicious rapping.Shaggy 2 Dope is great here too , I would n't consider him in the same category with J on the lyrical tip , maybe flow-wise , but he falls short when it comes to wordplay . But his raps are always great to hear on an Insane Clown Posse album anyday.As for the production . The legendary Mike E Clark makes a triumph return . His beats have drastically improved since he left right after `` Forgotten Freshness , Vol . 3 '' dropped . His production here is experimental and atmospheric . It sets the theme really well for the concept of the album.Mike E Clark is n't the only producer here , though . Underground rap producer Akuma also laid down some additional production , namely the guitars , his additional production here is what I consider `` the icing on the cake '' . All I got ta say here is ; Mike , welcome home.Here 's my individual track ratings .01 . `` The Sky Is Falling '' -LRB- A + -RRB- 02 . `` Ride The Tempest '' -LRB- A + -RRB- 03 . `` Alley Rat '' -LRB- A - -RRB- 04 . `` Haunted Bumps -LRB- ft. Mike E Clark -RRB- '' -LRB- A + -RRB- 05 . `` Growing Again '' -LRB- A -RRB- 06 . `` Hum Drum Boogie '' -LRB- A - -RRB- 07 . `` I Do This ! '' -LRB- A - -RRB- 08 . `` What About Now ? '' -LRB- A + -RRB- 09 . `` Watch My Ride '' -LRB- A + -RRB- 10 . `` News At 6 O'Clock '' -LRB- B -RRB- 11 . `` The Tower '' -LRB- A + -RRB- -LRB- favorite -RRB- 12 . `` The Party -LRB- ft. DJ Clay -RRB- '' -LRB- A + -RRB- 13 . `` B * tch I Lied '' -LRB- A - -RRB- 14 . `` Play My Song '' -LRB- A + -RRB- 15 . `` Mexico City '' -LRB- C + -RRB- -LRB- least favorite -RRB- 16 . `` If I Was A Serial Killer '' -LRB- A + -RRB- As you can tell , nearly every track got an A from me . That 's something I rarely do . This album is just that good . Oh , and FYI , they did n't change `` The Tempest '' from a raging storm to a mere roller-coaster . What they did was make a HUGE storm -LRB- as you can clearly see all the lightning throughout the CD cover/inserts -RRB- and put Juggalos on the roller-coaster and while we Juggalos are riding through the devastating storm , those corrupted haters below are being swept away . Makes perfect sense.Anyway , I recommend this to ALL Juggalos , horrorcore rap fans and all underground rap fans . This album is personally , in my top 5 Insane Clown Posse albums of all time . Pure genius . Peace.Mike E Clark appears courtesy of Strange Music.DJ Clay appears courtesy of Psychopathic Records . ~ Raw hide
 Mike Clark really creates some crazy atmospheric beats . Clearly the best part of this album is the music , it actually sounds exactly like the album cover looks . The lyrics and rapping are n't bad , but like everyone else here has said it is n't as wicked as most juggalos would have hoped for -LRB- aside from `` the tower '' and `` play my song '' -RRB- . As for the rest , you can expect unique song concepts by J and Shaggy laid over electrical beats that were ultimately well produced . Like the title of this review suggests , there is a LOT here in the way of some good old fashioned sonic madness .
 I bought the Tempest in September having no idea what to expect and I found the CD . The Tempest is creative and good ol Mark E Clark back which would make most fans happy . There is only one flaw I found about this album ... its not wicked sorry but its true the CD is not wicked compared to others like The Amazing Jeckel Bros , Great Milenko , even the 6 Card Series had more wicked than this CD but either way its still good . It sounds more like 80 's rap mix in with modern day Rap/Rock some my favorite hits are Alley Rat , Haunted Bumps , Growing again , I Do This ! , News at 6 O Clock , Play my song and If I was Serial Killer which I find funny as hell Violent J is singing on Piano
 Being a big fan of The Great Milenko and The Amazing Jeckel Brothers this is what i would expect from ICP . No fancy Lyrics but some funny stuff thrown in and the beats keep you movin ' .
 I have to admit it.I only bought this album because I knew that Mike E Clark had hooked up with ICP again.After wasting money on The Wraith and The Calm ... well , all I can say is that I really do n't like throwing money at guys who are just barely trying.BUT ... THIS ALBUM RE-ESTABLISHES AND RE-DEFINES ICP + Mike E Clark.Believe it or not , Violent J ... and Shags actually sing on this album ... and it ROCKS.There are some genuinely EXCELLENT `` tunes '' on this CD ... And while Violent J and Shags have both mellowed a bit ... they can still produce BRILLIANT `` NUTTY '' material when they want to.I really enjoyed this CD ... and I think you will too!It 's DEFINITELY a KEEPER !
 What can I say but a brilliant album . from start to finish . I recommend this . Juggalo or not .
 This album is awesome , the reason I gave it four is that the songs did n't get really awesome until track 6 . The songs before it were good , but I think it took a while before the album really blew me away . If you are a fan , I would recommend this . It is great .
 A lot of people are saying that this album is n't wicked , and they 're right , but it IS a good album . I think by now we should all except that ICP 's wicked days are behind them , but at least with Mike E. Clark back , they can still make good music . Ride The Tempest , Haunted Bumps , Watch My Ride , The Tower , Bitch I Lied and Play My Song are all great tracks , and for the first time in a long time , this ICP cd could stay in your cd player for a while .
 -LRB- This review is for Juggalos , it ai n't for people who just want to hear some pop BS rapping about rims and BS . So if you like Mush Mouth , AKA 50 pennies , you wo n't like the ICP . Oh and Quit snitchen ! < :-D -RRB- ... On to the review , this wan an excellent CD . With The Calm many people were jumping off of bridges saying `` ICP sucks now ! '' ect ... Well F you if you were saying that sheet moron ! They have made more god dammed CDs than any other artist out there , they are like dope fiends who need a hit and the only way to get that hit is by making CDs , so naturally when you make as many as they do , one or two will not be the best CD out there . `` But what about us , we paid good money for this CD ? '' If you have not learned now to steal CD 's -LRB- because the artists still get paid -RRB- , you 're a lame.OK really on to the review.SongsThe Sky is Falling
 Ah , ICP 's The Tempest . Juggalos have been waiting awhile for this one . After the two versions of the Sixth dropped , juggalos were at a loss as for what more we could expect from the Clownz . Then the 8-track EP The Calm was released and it foretold a dark , horrendous storm that would sweep the land . Well , apparently ICP decided a storm just was n't enough , so The Tempest became a violent maelstrom that spun into form a fierce rollercoaster , and it is this monstrous contraption from the beyond that bore the name The Tempest . This album reunites the Clownz with their legendary producer Mike E. Clark who helped define their sound . Now , a lot of idiots are dissappointed with this album because it is n't `` wicked '' enough . Look , when ICP released Carnival of Carnage they were 19 and 20 , respectively . Now they 're in their mid-30 's , are married , and have kids for God 's sake . You ca n't expect an artist not to expirement with their sound and try new things after 15 plus years.This album is the beginning of a great new direction for ICP . They continue to be , without a doubt , the most original and creative rap artists in existence today . ICP do n't rap a bunch of meaningless bullcrap about how rich they are , the new grills they have in their teeth , and how the hubcaps on their Chevrolets spin when they drive . ICP rap about what 's important to them , what they wish they could change , and the people and things in and about society that suck in a subliminal and unconventional manner . They are also hysterical and entertaining to a fault . The ONLY downside to this album is that it seems to end on a loose note . It does n't feel like it has any real closure , something I ca n't say about ANY other ICP album . The best tracks are `` Haunted Bumps '' `` Growing Again '' , `` I Do This '' , `` What About Now '' , `` Watch My Ride '' , `` News at 6:00 '' , `` The Party '' , `` B **** I Lied '' , and `` If I Was A Serial Killer '' , even though it does n't end the album well . Overall , I am down with the clown till I 'm dead in the ground baby , and The Tempest delivers .
 They have been saying that this album was going to be their effort to take the group in a new direction and its definitely different then their previous releases . If your down with the clown you 'll appreciate this album for what it is .
 well id like to say from 2 pieces of crap to 2 multi millionaires from having an idea of wicked clowns . people can say what they want about icp they made it . i like there new idea on this cd its not like there old stuff , we keep saying old stuff , but this is new direction you dont like it dont buy it . why would they keep going with the joker card idea when thats over . the clowns always tell a story in there music.my fav songs are 2,3 shaggs kills this i love this song its my fav4 ,5,8,9,10,11,14 this song is my second fav .
 this album came along and showed me that ICP can still do it . the great milinko was probably the last of the best joker cards . i listened to the calm , and i liked that too , but i dont own it yet . i remember when i first heard of icp , it was when the great milinko came out , and how they were pulling the hollywood records version due to them being dropped from that label because it was owned by disney . so my momma took me to the store and sure enough i got the last copy of the hollywood records version they had . to bad it wasnt the gold foil milinko because that would have been worth a bunch . i do have a zippo thats worth a lot from ICP . so my review on the tempest is , its great .
 To clear the air , Deah Dame sadly departed from this earth in 1994 . Damian Broadus followed two years later in ' 96 . While they were here , they contributed an album that I enjoy listening to over and over again . Deah really soars on the balladry , namely `` when i 'm crying '' and `` love come near me '' . Also , laface puts their new jack skills to work on the uptempo numbers '' exclusivity '' , `` got ta learn the rhythm '' , and `` dont remind me '' . Needless to say , Damian Dame were truly talented . Unfortunately , the popular audience overlooked the new jack gem . Had they continued , they could have amassed enormous success during new jack and beyond . However , this is only musical contribution they gave to us . If you are a casual new jack fan , this album is a must , especially with their social significance .
 At the time of this album 's release , producer Kenneth ` Babyface ' Edmonds was just making inroads on the popular music scene -LRB- having released a successful solo album and the soundtrack to `` Boomerang , '' while also creating hits for other artists as diverse as Sheena Easton , Whitney Houston , and Boyz II Men.Damian Dane 's first , and only , effort represents the producer/writer at his best , with infectious rhythms , dynamic and jazzy outro vocals , and lyrical ballads . The songs , though reflective of the `` New Jack Swing '' era , are still a cut above others produced at the same time , showing how a producer can ascend above the norm and make something that outlasts its time.The hit single `` Exclusivity '' is on the album but the best track is `` Do n't Remind Me , '' a tune that shows its origins in ` Face 's own `` My Kinda Girl . '' `` Do n't Remind Me '' lets the pair of Damian Dane , as well as the supporting instrumentalists , have a little fun with the lyrics , being highly improvisational as the song ends.I ca n't understand why that track was not released as a single . In my humble opinion , it would 've done extremely well.As was mentioned by another reviewer , both singers that formed the duo are no longer among the living . Their only release is a fitting tribute to the music they made , as well as a glimpse of what could have been .
 it was not flawed in any way i am happy wth the result.i was flabbergasted at how good the cd played without a scratch

 Everything was good about it . I was impressed . It came on time . I will surely recommend it to anyone . Thanx
 To this day I still listen to this album . It was very good and brings back a lot of memories for me . They were taken too soon .
 I 'm overall satisfied !! I enjoyed this group unfortunately they both passed away . However , their legacy lives on through the great music they made .
 For those of you who remember those early days of the 1990 's , where Big Hair , Cross Colours , and great dance music . New Jack was at it 's absolute height , Damian Dame delivered a musical masterpiece with their debut album . I loved every track on the CD , and after all these years , I recently found a copy of the CD and have been listening to it and enjoying it . `` Love Come Near Me '' , and `` Virgin Island '' are among my favorite cuts . Sadly , both members of the group died on the exact same day two years apart , one from cancer , and the other from injuries sustained in a car accident . Never the less , they delivered a beautiful album on the LaFace label .
 Oh Yeah ! DamianDame ... Funky , refreshing and fun . Its about time too!I used to listen to this album ALL DAY ! ... all of a sudden they disappeared . You can never go wrong on this one ! Good party jams too .
 Dame -LRB- Debra Jean Hurd -RRB- passed away June 27 , 1994 at the age of 37 from injuries sustained in an automobile accident . Damian -LRB- Bruce Edward Broadus -RRB- passed away June 27 , 1996 at the age of 29 from colon cancer . To learn more , go to http://www.angelfire.com/me/ladyrichards/index.html
 Great CD.If you are any kind of Levon fan in his time with `` The Band , '' this is a rare treat . An entire album of Levon in fantastic voice , well chosen songs and players bring vibrant classic performances . Unbelievably recorded , and remastered from the original master tapes , ot me this Levon album is on par with his previous work in `` The Band , '' as John Fogerty 's `` Centerfield '' is to his days with Creedence . Many of the songs are muscular and rhytmic blues romps that can make the hair on your arms and neck tingle like `` I 've Got a Bet With Myself , '' and `` Get Out Your Big Roll Daddy , and the ballad `` Even A Fool Would Let Go '' is enough to make your heart break before the end of the first chorus . No stone was left unturned in the care taken to bring this album to CD , as they even found a B-side of a 45 to add as a bonus track and provide lovingly prepaired liner notes and artwork . This is a great CD brought back to life with the same passion that brought it to life the first time , for which I am very thankful .
 This UK release is a straight re-issue of two of Lynn 's original albums on one CD . The same two CD 's were released in the USA as Golden classic edition , but with a few extra tracks.Both albums contain plenty of covers . Indeed , Rose garden was itself a cover . It was written by Joe South and originally appeared on the same album of his that included Games people play -LRB- which has also been covered by Lynn , but her version has never appeared on CD -RRB- . Lynn had a major international hit with it , going high in the pop charts in Britain , America and many other countries.Among the songs covered by Lynn on the Rose Garden album are For the good times -LRB- Kris Kristofferson -RRB- , Another lonely night -LRB- Jean Shepherd -RRB- , I do n't want to play house -LRB- Tammy Wynette -RRB- , Snowbird -LRB- Anne Murray -RRB- , Sunday morning coming down -LRB- Kris Kristofferson -RRB- and It 's only make believe -LRB- Conway Twitty -RRB- . The original songs include two co-written by her then-husband -LRB- Your sweet love lifted me , I wish I was a little boy again -RRB- and Nothing between us , a song Lynn wrote herself.The second album is You 're my man . The title track , one of four songs that Glenn Sutton wrote or co-wrote , was a huge country hit . Most , if not all , of the other songs are covers , including Knock three times -LRB- Tony Orlando and Dawn -RRB- , Proud Mary -LRB- Creedence Clearwater Revival -RRB- , Help me make it through the night -LRB- Kris Kristofferson -RRB- , Put your hand in the hand -LRB- first recorded by Anne Murray -RRB- and Joy to the world -LRB- Three dog night -RRB- . This is an excellent collection but you do n't need it if you have the Golden classics edition .
 Lynn Anderson could sing out the telephone book and I 'd be standing there , applauding and hoping for more ! Her sense of timing , her phrasing and her excellent diction all combine to showcase her tremendous command of just about anything and everything she ever sang . This fine CD has all the songs from two of Lynn 's albums , her incredibly successful `` Rose Garden '' -LRB- the largest selling album by any female country recording artist from 1971 to 1997 -RRB- and `` You 're My Man '' which also hit high on the charts ! There really is n't a bad track on the CD ; this music is all THAT good . The quality of the sound is every bit as good as another reviewer says it is ; and the artwork incorporates the original artwork from the record albums when they were released . `` Rose Garden , '' a song that made it to the top of the country and pop charts shortly after it was released , gives the track set an auspicious start ; Lynn sings this to perfection and I 'm very impressed . The strings and guitar are used to great advantage ; and I really like Lynn 's rendition of `` For the Good Times ; '' it 's like listening to silk . `` Another Lonely Night '' has a great country flavor to it ; and listen for other tracks including `` I Do n't Want to Play House '' which Lynn delivers with all her heart and soul ; `` Snowbird '' that has Lynn squarely front and center -- which is right where Lynn belongs ! `` Your Sweet Love Lifted Me ; '' `` Sunday Morning Coming Down '' and `` I Still Belong to You '' are very well done , too.Lynn 's talent also shines through on other tracks ; there 's `` I Wish I Was a Little Boy Again ; '' the very poignant `` It 's Only Make Believe '' and `` Nothing Between Us ; '' `` You 're My Man '' with Lynn singing faultlessly ; `` I Can Spot a Cheater '' with some backup as Lynn sings ; `` I 'm Gon na Write a Song '' with its upbeat musical arrangement to accompany Lynn as she sings ; `` Cry , Cry Again '' with some fine guitar and more although wisely the musicians never even try to steal the spotlight -- Lynn sweeps up the stage as she always did ! Lynn 's rendition of `` Knock Three Times '' by Tony Orlando and Dawn is well done ; and I also enjoy the spirited `` Flying Machine . '' Lynn performs `` Proud Mary '' with a great deal of genuine feeling while `` Help Me Make It through the Night '' is good ; and `` Put Your Hand in the Hand '' is moving , to say the least . `` Joy to the World , '' which was first performed by Three Dog Night , gets a fine treatment from Lynn ; and the CD ends strong with Lynn Anderson performing `` I Might as Well Be Here Alone . `` This CD is terrific for any Lynn Anderson fan . Moreover , Lynn 's talent is so abundantly clear on this CD that this also makes a fine introductory album for anyone just discovering Lynn Anderson 's gift that she has shared with us all .
 I bought this CD mainly because I was looking for an original recording of Rose Garden . I had bought a couple of others only to find they were inferior re-takes of the song . This one has the original and many other good songs . Plus , it 's two albums for the price of one . Highly recommended .
 This CD combines Lynn Anderson 's albums Rose Garden and You 're My Man . Besides her own hits like Rose Garden , You 're My Man and Nothing Between Us , it 's mainly a collection of country covers of pop hits from the late 1960s and early 1970s and Anderson 's interpretations are enjoyable . Backed by a lush , string-driven country pop sound , she delivers memorable and engaging renditions of classics like For The Good Times , I Do n't Want To Play House , Proud Mary , Snowbird and It 's Only Make Believe . I also love her versions of Dawn 's huge 1971 hit Knock Three Times and Flying Machine , Cliff Richard 's minor hit from the same year . She even makes Three Dog Night 's Joy To The World her own , although I do n't think she succeeds so well on Kris Kristofferson 's Sunday Morning Coming Down . Somehow I just ca n't imagine Lynn Anderson stumbling down the stairs with a hangover on a Sunday morning , although to be fair , everybody covered this song at one time or another . Other very listenable numbers include I Can Spot A Cheater , Cry Cry Again , the gospel song Put Your Hand In The Hand and Help Me Make It Through The Night . She has a strong and warm country voice and the backing is beautiful in that early 1970s way . I love this album as it really evokes the spirit of that golden age of song.Lynn Anderson
 i grew up with old country . i did not like it when i was young but i love it now .
 My all time favorite country artist . This cd has all my favorites on it . Ca n't get enough of Lynn Anderson .
 This realease shows the best of meatloaf and the different styles that the artiste is able to do . The passion that meatloaf sings with can not be taught it comes from within .
 If you have ever listened to meatloaf before then you knowthe raw energy that the powerfull blend of Jim Steinman & Marvin Lee Aday -LRB- Meatloaf -RRB- is . But if you are one of those people that has never turned an ear towards meatloaf or if your just one of those snobs that looks down on a fat man singing about love then you need to by this album.It covers the rise , fall and the second go around for the man that is to stuborn to stop . I am waiting for the next album to come out but this will have to do for now . If you like soft ballads and hard powerfull rock sounds then this is for but if you are a fan of meatloaf you already know this so shut off the computer and play Bat out of hell and follow it up with 2 0ut of 3 ai n't bad . I only give this a four because wasted youth is missing from this CD .
 I was thrilled when I saw SINGIN ' WITH EMMYLOU VOL . 1 on up-coming releases along with the re-issues of CIMARRON and LAST DATE . It was an instant purchase . Even the devoted and obsessive fans -LRB- like myself -RRB- may find this album tries their patience . Raven Records did a great job with this compilation
 I 've been waiting years on an Emmylou collection to include the song `` Only the Heart May Know '' with Dan Fogelberg . It was missing from her duet album a few years ago and this collection finally includes it . There are many songs making this a memorable compilation since Emmylou leaves her mark on every song she collaborates on , even for background vocals only . Since it would be tough to buy all the individual cd 's everything is on , this is a find to someone who loves her work .
 IF YOU ARE AS BIG OF FAN AS I AM , RUN TO THE STORE AND PICK UP THIS ONE ! I THINK EMMYLOU HAS COLLABORATED WITH ALMOST EVERY GREAT SINGER , AND THERE ARE SOME GOOD ONES ON THIS CD ! EMMYLOU 'S BEAUTIFUL VOICE IS ONE OF A KIND , AND IT ALWAYS STICKS OUT NO MATTER WHO SHE IS SINING WITH ! I AM REALLY GLAD THEY ARE ALREADY WORKING ON VOLUME 2 . I WILL ALSO BE ADDING THAT TO MY COLLECTION .
 Some people are clearly disappointed by the low Emmylou content on this compilation although the front cover clearly says 20 country recordings featuring the duet or backing vocals of Emmylou Harris . However , Emmylou seems to be more in evidence on this volume than on the sequel , so if you do n't think you can hear enough of Emmylou here , do n't even bother with volume 2 . If , however , you accept this for what it is , you may find it an enjoyable listening experience.In picking out highlights , I 've based my assessment purely on the music and not on how much Emmylou contributes to each track . The set opens in great style with a duet from Willie Nelson 's Honeysuckle Rose soundtrack and a high standard is maintained throughout . My favorite track here is Mexican wind , performed by Jann Browne . As Jann 's voice is similar to Emmylou 's , it is difficult to identify Emmylou 's voice here . Then again , if you enjoy one of their voices , why would n't you enjoy the other 's voice too ? Emmylou co-wrote Woman walk the line for her concept album , Ballad of Sally Rose . Highway 101 later covered it and so did Trisha Yearwood . Here you 'll find Trisha 's excellent version . Other highlights include Oh Carolina -LRB- Vince Gill -RRB- , That 's all it took -LRB- a duet with Gram Parsons -RRB- , Here we are -LRB- a duet with George Jones -RRB- and Rachel -LRB- Gary Stewart -RRB- , but every track here is brilliant.The writer of the comprehensive and impressive liner notes thinks that Street of this town -LRB- Mary Kay Place -RRB- is the most obscure track here . Actually , both of her albums were released as a twofer a few years ago on Raven -LRB- the label that is also responsible for this compilation -RRB- , so it 's not obscure to me as I bought and reviewed it a long time ago.Taken for what it is , which is a collection of great country music by a wide variety of singers , this is brilliant although you wo n't find many hits here . Just do n't expect to hear too much of Emmylou . Judged as an Emmylou album , it would rate one star , but judged for what it is , I have no hesitation in awarding it five stars .
 She has her own career and many beautiful cds , but she has also done some wonderful background work and gorgeous duets as well ! Many of those are highlighted here ! work with artists like George Jones , Kathy Mattea , Trisha Yearwood , the late Dan Fogelberg , Pure Prairie League , , just to name a few ! Their is already a Vol 2 out , , , how long do we have to wait for Vol 3 Emmy ? Do n't make us beg !! LOLAnyway , the CD was in great shape , came quickly and played beautifully ! Kudos to the seller and to Emmylou ! = -RRB-
 Is a wonderful CD , I have listened to it many many times , and have enjoyed it so much . Emma Lou 's voice is wonderful , and all the singers on this album are just great .
 This album is a perfect introduction to just what it is that makes the Cramps such a special slice of pure , unadulterated rock and roll . The thing is , the Cramps have been around since the mid-70 's and have never let up being the hardest-working band around , never relenting and never slowing down for a second . This album only proves that they set the pace and everyone else is out of breath trying to catch up . This is a 1994 album and outdoes the whole bratpack of rockabilly and garage rock newcomers 20 years their juniors . Lux and Ivy have got it down on this album , an album that never lets up for a second ; even when it dips into the slower numbers , it 's still got you firmly by the throat , it 's just shaking you a little bit softer.There are so many good songs on here that the mind reels . Stuff that could easily make for a decades worth of underground classics and minor-league hits all get crammed together here . From `` Let 's Get F 'd Up '' -LRB- a personal favorite and an anthem for all time -RRB- to `` Naked Girl Falling Down the Stairs '' to `` Strange Love '' to their knee-trembling cover of `` Route 66 . '' This surely ai n't the best that the Cramps have to offer , but , if anything , it 's a clearly marked billboard announcing they never left and they surely are n't going away anytime soon.Get it , redeem your faith in rock and roll .
 Here we find Lux and Ivy -LRB- and hired guns -RRB- at their best . Here is the album to pop on at the party , and a good one to play when driving 100 mph late at night . The production and performances are superb .
 Well , I 've been buying on average of two Cramps albums a week for the past three weeks after having Smell of Female for years , but never taking the step . Something hit me . When I first listened to Stay Sick , after having listened nonstop to A Date for Elvis , I thought `` ahh , well , '' then it grew and grew on me , with the exception of the last three bonus tracks . Flamejob has worked a similar effect . At first it seems inferior , but then with `` I 'm Customized , '' `` Nest of a Cuckoo Bird '' -LRB- great absurdist sexo-apocryphal lyrics -RRB- , `` Ultra Twist , '' and a slew of other greats ... `` Inside Out and Upside Down with You , '' `` Swing the Big Eyed Rabbit , '' `` Sinners , '' and `` Naked Girl ... '' This album is admittedly not as good as Stay Sick or A Date with Elvis , a little too heavy on the rock n roll and light on the punk and the sleaze -LRB- though when it is sleazy , it is in full force
 I lost the copy of Flamejob I bought @ a Cramps show , so I was happy to get a replacement . One of the few releases I would actually care to have in my music library , its remains a timely piece . Teenagers still love their music . Flamejob represents a more highly-polished Cramps while still maintaining the original quality of songs from their `` Songs the Lord Taught Us '' days . I wish Flamejob videos were available commercially .
 It 's got ta be said if you 're a Cramps fan then you 'll love this off beat collection of foot stomping beats !
 Pretty much your usual Cramps record here.No complaints though . ` Flamejob ' is no doubt a highly energetic fueled CD that 's sure to fully please any Cramps fan , rather he/she be old school or new.Plenty of foot-stompers here , like `` Mean Machine '' , `` Ultra Twist '' -LRB- miss seeing the video -RRB- , `` Let 's Get F**ked Up '' , their abuse song `` Naked Girl Falling Down The Stairs '' , `` Trapped Love '' and `` Route 66 '' . As the Cramps seem to always deliver the goods , another great psychobilly release to hold and to cherish.A true keeper .
 The Cramps are another one of my most favorite bands . I possess every studio album they released , including 2003 's `` Fiends of Dope Island . '' With their own warped rockabilly rhythms and catchy lyrics , the Cramps have developed a huge and faithful cult following of college graduates -LRB- like myself -RRB- , and artsy freaks . This 1994 album features the classic `` Ultra Twist , '' which to me is the most infectious dance song since `` The Time Warp '' from the Rocky Horror Picture Show . A few of the other songs , most notably `` Nest of the Cuckoo Bird '' and `` Sado County Auto Show '' contain both easy chorus hooks and lots of obvious sexual innuendos . It also seems that the Cramps -LRB- after coming off the excesses of the late 1980 's -RRB- have been inspired by past historical art movements and have taken them in as part of a way of life . `` Let 's Get F*cked UP '' is not only about psychedelic drugs , but also about leaving behind society 's oppressive views on `` good '' art , and instead immersing onself in Surrealism -LRB- which became famous because its images came straight from both dreams and the mind -RRB- The funny , punk-style `` Naked Girl Falling Down the Stairs '' was actually inspired by the `` Nude Descending a Staircase '' painting by Dada artist Marcel Duchamp . Lux even mentions Pablo Picasso in `` I 'm Customized . '' `` How Come you Do Me '' and a couple the other later tracks are in the style of Rhythm & Blues , with Lux 's famous Elvis-impersonator vocals . I must recommend this album to savy music buyers all over the world . Let Amazon know that the Cramps will never die !
 The Cramps are awesome . They have gotten kind of cheesier over the years , but that only makes them more fun . The important thing here is that they rock . This is seriously cool music . There are a couple of songs on the album that are a bit too silly -LRB- Stay Sick had the same problem -RRB- but overall it is a great rockin listen .
 Visually , the Cramps had lost none of their impact with this collection and the supporting tour , yet there is something of a pause here in their oeuvre , for this is the point at which the Cramps leapt from basement nightmares to graduate school appreciation that invoked the use of pretentious French words by irony aware critics . And with that audience solidified-however much the Cramps may disdain a fickle esthete fan base-the expectation for `` Flame Job '' was high . Instead , the Cramps did it their way and < yawn ! > delivered yet another Cramps album.Stand out songs that invoke your ooze are `` Ultra Twist '' and `` Swing the Big Eyed Rabbit , '' but a departure is the nearly haunting `` Strange Love '' that begs to be covered by Mazzy Star , or at least Hope Sandoval . This curious tune and `` Sinners '' in the mix suggests that the Cramps were on the border of flirting with torch songs as a step towards innuendo over double-entendre for lyrical sexual allusions . As the album loses with a definitive well worn cover of Route 66 this possibility remains unexplored . Ivy 's guitar work on `` Route 66 '' is exemplary , both spare and alluring , is among her finest work and further demonstrates that she is a more accomplished artist than eye candy in a leotard.In sum , this album does not equal `` Songs the Lord Taught Us '' or `` Stay Sick ! '' for sheer appeal , but it has more merits than simply being an object for Cramps completists .
 This is the first project from Rock County but the members of this band have been around the block more than once . Serving time with many great bluegrass outfits including -LRB- but not limited too -RRB- , The Lonesome River Band , The Reno Brothers , Longview , Lonesome Standard Time and Unlimited Tradition . They have proven themselves to be excellent vocalists and instrumentalists in the past.This album is a solid effort , a good starting point for the band . But I felt that they played it safe a little too much . I expected more songs written by these high profile artists that have proven they can write their own material and deliver it with gusto , but they went elsewhere for all but two of the tracks . Perhaps they needed to feel each other out a bit . Highlights include `` Turn it On - Turn It On - Turn It On '' and the sentimental `` It 'll Get You Where Your Going '' . There are many great vocal moments and harmonies that will send chills up your spine.I ca n't wait for the follow up and hope to see them live soon . if you like bluegrass you will enjoy this CD .
 This CD is a great representation of the vocals that have taken bluegrass by storm , there is no better in the business that Dpn Rigsby , he is awesome , every member of this band , has great bluegrass experience , and even though I was sad that Don left Lonesome River Band , I really think he has a great thing going with his new band Rock County , if you want to make a good purchase and have a complete CD of songs that are great then this is the cd for you . . give it a try ...
 I love this album and every bluegrass listener should have it a part of their library .
 These guys have put a great band together and it has paid off with a great album . Wonderful balance of vocals with some wicked fiddlin ' . Not a widely known group but they should be ! Real down home bluegrass sound with crisp clean lyrics and instrumentals . Ca n't say enough !
 THIS GROUP DID N'T RECEIVE THE ATTENTION THEY DESERVED . I OWN THIS CD , AND I PLAY IT CONSTANTLY . I OWN THE SINGLE OF ` HAVE I NEVER ' , AND I OWN THE FULL LENGTH CD . ' A FEW GOOD MEN ' IS ONE OF BABYFACE 'S BEST PROT&Eacute;G&Eacute;S . I WISH THEY WOULD MAKE ANOTHER CD .

 Hugo Weisgall -LRB- 1912-1997 -RRB- was born in Moravia and a descendant of a long line of cantors . The family immigrated to the United States in 1920 . Weisgall went on to a long and distinguished career as an composer and educator . He is probably best known for his operas such as Six Characters in Search of an Author -LRB- 1956 -RRB- . Weisgall composed both secular music as well as music which drew heavily on Jewish sources.The disk under review is part of the Naxos lablel 's outstanding `` American Classics '' series . It is part of a special subset of that series that consists of music with specifically Jewish content written by Jewish-American composers . The series is drawn from the collection of the Miliken Archive , which was created in 1990 as a project to organize and encourage the study of the substantial amount of Jewish-American music that remains too little known.The CD is attractively put together with intriguing cover art and with an unusually thorough booklet including biographical information about Hugo Weisgall and detailed commentary on each work included on this CD . Complete English texts for the three vocal works on the disk also are provided.Weisgall 's music is chromatic , atonal and difficult . He was much influenced in his compositional style by Schoenberg , Berg , and Webern . Yet the music is passionate , craggy and moving . It reminded me of the music of George Rochberg , and of an earlier Jewish-American immigrant composer , Leo Orenstein , whose work is too little known.Of the works on this CD , I particularly enjoyed the two song cycles . The first , `` Psalm of the Distant Dove '' -LRB- 1992 -RRB- is for piano and soprano . It is performed here by Ann Maria Martinez , soprano and Kristen Okerlund , piano . This is a work in seven movements that sets sons paying `` homage to Sephardi Culture . '' The cycle is an attempt to capture the difficult relationship between God and the people of Israel . The songs are set to a variety of poems and are craggy and harsh . The piano writing is particularly spare . Several of the songs open with a piano prelude , and there is a brief but moving piano solo near the end of the work in the memory of William Schuman.The second work for solo voice on this CD is `` A Garden Eastward '' -LRB- 1952 -RRB- which Weisgall regarded as the `` most beautiful '' of his compositions . This work is performed by Phyllis Bryn-Julson , soprano and the Barcelona Symphony/National Orchestra of Catalonia conducted by Jorge Meister . This work is in three movements , marked Fantasia , Scherzo , and Free Variation , and sets poetry by the medieval Jewish-Spanish poet and philosopher Ibn Ezra -LRB- 1055-1135 -RRB- . The finale of this work makes use of Jewish liturgical themes . This is a work of passion and awe as the medieval poet and Weisgall reflect on the majesty of the divine.The disk also includes an orchestral work , `` T'kiatot : Rituals for Rosh Hashana '' -LRB- 1986 -RRB- performed by the Seatle Symphony conducted by Gerard Schwarz . The work is in three movements which parallel three parts of the Jewish Service for the New Year . The three sections of the work capture the three aspects of God basic to the New Year Service
 Ok , here 's the deal . I like this CD . It is a good CD . I 've listened to it several times in a row on occasion . It has songs that most will find familiar and even sing along to . Growing up in the 80 's and early 90 's , these are the songs I listened to before I knew what electronic music was . Alterations to the songs are subtle but worth the listen . Likely as not you 'll find yourself jammin ' out to what you 're listening to . Take a look at the track list , then take a ride down memory lane . This disk is almost exactly what you would expect to hear late on a slow night in the club . So , raise your glass and say hi to that stranger sitting next to you at the bar .
 Think of this as a playlist for an ipod , not a remix album . This is an effort by the band to turn people on to songs that would n't necessarily be on your list of dance party tunes ; but trust me , at 4 a.m. you 'll be singing along at the top of your lungs .
 Firstly , this is not at all like Dirty Vegas music , at all ! Anyone expecting to hear something along those lines should look at the studio albums . This is however another in a long line of DJ-esque mix cd 's put together by artists to show off thier musical knowledge . But do n't get me wrong this is a superb mix of songs . Of course many people will mumble about hearing that song a thousand times , or having that one already but what you wo n't realise is that whilst playing this album on your way to work or at a party with friends there is a uniqueness and subtle sublime to this album that really does hook you in . The selection is varied even if they are from roughly the same era of 80-90 's pop/rock electronica crossover . I cant praise this album enough really for the craftsmanship and excellent production quality of a very slick mix cd . If anyone is interesting in DJing and wants to learn how to beat mix well then nearly every transition on this cd is flawless , each tune grooves into the next effortlessly like it was always meant to be the next tune . Something that has been lacking in several other mix cd 's on the market today.Lastly I would not hesitate to buy this if you like the look of the track listing as it wo n't catch you out when you are at a party , ... you tell everyone you have a killer cd , put it on and 3 tracks in it hits a major down track of complete embarrassement and you dont know where to hide your face - This will not happen here .
 It was a total accident that I got this CD , but it is one of my favorite jazz CDs . I was looking for smooth vocal work by Astrud Gilberto and had never heard of trombonist Mukai . But once it was cranked up in the stereo , I was hooked ! I heartily recommend this CD ! GREAT JAZZ !
 This record is a great example of what roots rock is supposed to be . There is a variety of music on this record from lap steel guitar to electric fiddle - all pleasing to the soul . This is the best of the seven records this group has produced yet . The variety , good rhythm , and sensational lyrics are what make this record great . This includes members of the Bruce Hornsby Band on vocals , organ , and saxophone . This record is excellent and is worth every penny .
 First obtained this `` ambient '' gem in 2001 . Brilliant for what it is - two talented artists creating atmospheric music for already atmospheric environments . My favorite for a cold , solitary stormy night in a candle lit space , while nursing a brandy or port wine with the wind howling through open windows ! Contrary to the opinion of the previous reviewer , I feel that any words or phrases not perfectly intelligible only lend to a languid , yet bewitching quality that sends my imagination into haunted Victorian attics , secret groves , and 18th c. dungeons ; its nine tracks flow from one imaginative vignette to another , in a dreamy , uncluttered style . If you 're looking to be `` blown away '' musically , this album may be to `` tame '' for what you 're looking for . But if you find yourself in a pensive mood some night , turn out the lights , light some candles , close your eyes , and let Thistle seduce you . Thank you Danielle and Kelly , wherever you are these days !
 Make sure this is not already in your collection if you 're curious about this Irish band.Many versions exist of the same 12 tracks . I wanted to mention this to caution buyers
 These are lesser known pieces of Mozart comprising mainly of etudes and unfinished compositions that were rounded off after Mozart 's death.Although these pieces are by no means masterpieces , under the wonderful hands of Staier they are given resonance and meaning that confirm the great powers of Mozart as a composer.Of all the pieces , it is Allemende which is the highlight here . The playing is ghostlike . On the fortepiano , the effect is quite chilling and each phrase seems haunted by spirits of the great man himself.The key to all Staier recordings is the use of silence or brief , almost imperceptible pauses which allow the sense of a phrase sink in . He 's used this to great effect in his harpsichord recordings of Bach and he re-employs the technique for this recordings of Mozart.In Europe , Staier is considered a modern genius - listen to the Allemende and you 'll understand why .
 This is a great album ! Excellent musicianship and fun songs . I would generally describe it as country music , but the songs traverse a wide range of styles . This is not tear in your beer country music -- its more dynamic than that . The lyrics are thoughtful and , at times , funny . They put on a superb live performance , and I recommend that you check them out . Of course , the highlight of a show is their own songs , but keep your ears peeled for excellent covers from Johnny Cash to the Rolling Stones . Be sure to also check out Cosmic Americana .
 Of all the late 1960s and early 1970s vocal groups , Free Design are the most condusive to remixing . ` Not that there are any like this brilliant band . Those funky hooks and jazzy candies the band made , on all their albums , placed them about ten cuts above any other group they may have been racing with.That pays off on this remix album . Free Design are the only band of this kind from the era embraced by modern bands like Stereolab . The popping , grooving basslines and clean voice sheens that made this music work so well also lend themselves extremely well to modern remixes.This music just bursted on its own , and when put in the hands of modern bands and mixers who truely love the Free Design , you get an enhanced take on that explosion of tone color the Design used to stay at the top of their game.There are two volumes of these remixes and both are worth seeking out .
 The new great single from Scooter . They have a new sounds in this record , and pure rave energy that rocks !
 When you listen to this track you will be glad becouse it 's so much power in it , just listen to the extract from James Brown is dead . Makes you wan na go up from the chair and dance , right ? Just three words to say ` BUY THIS SINGEL '
 Helllooo fellow Stygians !! This is a great choice of three styx albums to be put together . Crystal Ball - 1976 , The Grand Illusion-1977 , Pieces of Eight - 1978 . I 'm 16 years old , Listening to this great music . But I still enjoy the new music/bands as well . Styx is SO underrated . Especially now . They have had two recent albums , CYCLORAMA - 2003 , and the most Recent , Big Bang Theory - 2005 . Both of these albums should be checked out by all.Back to the item at hand . All three albums have a great sound , no audiable `` cracks or pops '' like on the Lp . Each Cd comes with a booklet . the only disappointing thing abouth this collection is that they are the EXACT same CD as if you were to buy each cd individually . I bought this thinking that the cd 's would be remastered even more that the styx cd 's already being sold , I was wrong , but did n't mind . It is SO much better listening to styx on Lp , but it is easier listeing on cd 's if I 'm traveling , or on the road . This is perfect for someone who does not have these records on cd yet , but if you do , do n't bother , no surprises.on a side note . STYX HAS NOT LOST IT AT ALL . Even though Dennis DeYoung does tour anymore -LRB- which is a shame ! -RRB- , Styx is still Rockin ' the Paradise . I went to go see styx at the Big Fresno Fair , That was one of the best concerts that I have ever been to . Styx ROCKS !!!
 I do n't own this collection , but I own the 3 by themselves . Personally anything with Tommy Shaw singing is fantastic . I have never been a Dennis DeYoung fan and his overblown opera ballads I can do without . Lady was so overplayed that I can not stand it to this day . Along with Babe and by the time we got to Mr. Roboto I was thinking wth is going on here ? This is not rock , this is one person 's overblown ego doing weird crap that I can not imagine anyone paying money for , let alone see . The Grand Illusion and Pieces of Eight are my two favorite albums of Styx and Crystal Ball has some great stuff too . Either in this collection or individually they are worth buying . I saw the Behind The Music on Styx and I was ecstatic that they gave Dennis DeYoung the boot . He is just a little to artsy for a rock band -LRB- also I am not a huge fan of synthesizer 's in rock bands , even though these guys make it work most of the time/rock bands should be guitar driven -RRB- . That is strictly my opinion . I loved Damn Yankees and was sorry to see that one dissolve , but I believe that Tommy Shaw should be the voice of Styx . I , also , do not agree that they are has-beens . If they were and needed DDY to prop them up they would not still be around today .
 CRYSTAL BALL , THE GRAND ILLUSION , and PIECES OF EIGHT all in one collection ready to be ordered I think I 've died and gone to heaven I have to believe that is true . These are 3 of their best albums . And if you have n't bought these yet buy them now because this is definetly worth the price tag this is some of the best music you will ever hear . This is the best band of all-time . You will get some of their best songs like `` Blue Collar Man -LRB- Long Nights -RRB- '' , `` Renegade '' , `` Come Sail Away '' , `` Shooz '' , `` Grand Illusion '' , Pieces Of Eight '' , `` Crystal Ball '' , `` Superstars '' , `` Mademoiselle '' , `` Miss America '' , `` Queen Of Spades '' , `` Fooling Yourslef -LRB- The Angry Young Man -RRB- '' , `` Sing For The Day '' , `` Man In The Wilderness '' , `` I 'm Okay '' , and many many more . These are three albums any music fan will want to have in their possesion . Buy this great collection of music today or better yet NOW .
 This 3-CD set shows Styx beautifully hitting their stride , with Tommy Shaw joining the band and rounding out their sound . Prior to Shaw 's entrance -LRB- which can be heard on the 4-CD Wooden Nickel set -RRB- , Styx were doing a great job of `` evolving into Styx , '' but this 3-CD set is a MUST for anyone who wants to own a very important chapter in the history of Rock and Roll . These songs feature Styx helping to writing the book on how to perfectly balance and blend `` progressive rock '' professionalism and creativity with intense , fun ROCK AND ROLL . A previous reviewer stated that Styx is currently about `` how are we -LRB- meaning Shaw , Young , and whomever they can get to play with them -RRB- going to pay the bills , without Dennis DeYoung to carry us . Tommy Shaw coerced James Young to fire Dennis because he did n't like to do ` shows ' and now they have to find other has beens like REO to tour with to draw people to their shows . '' I will refute that right now . Dennis DeYoung and Styx parted ways in 1999 . In the six years since then , whether it be Styx alone or Styx co-headling with other `` has beens '' like REO Speedwagon and/or Journey , concert tickets with the name `` Styx '' on them have generated NINETY MILLION DOLLARS in ticket revenue . That 's $ 90 MILLION ! Or , $ 90,000,000.00 . -LRB- Get it ? -RRB- And that 's SINCE 1999 -LRB- since DeYoung 's departure -RRB- . Sound like a band struggling to pay the bills ? Sound like a band on `` has been '' concert tours ? Sound like a band who previously needed Dennis DeYoung to `` carry '' them ? And by the way , on August 22 2005 , `` Styx Greatest Hits '' was certified double platinum -LRB- see Billboard.com , click on `` RIAA CERTIFICATIONS '' -RRB- . In concert these days , current keyboardist and co-lead-vocalist Lawrence Gowan -LRB- who has 8 platinum albums in Canada -RRB- is doing a phenomenal job breathing additional life and energy into Styx 's music . His keyboard playing , his backing vocals , and his lead vocals are helping Styx 's concert tours maintain and increase interest in the classic music of Styx , as evidenced by the aforementioned recent double platinum status of Styx `` Greatest Hits . '' Every time Dennis DeYoung gets a royalty check , he should send Lawrence Gowan a `` Thank You '' note . And did I mention that Gowan has more vocal range than DeYoung ? I have now . Buy this 3-CD collection , go catch Styx on their current concert tour , and experience the fact that Styx ' music stands the test of time . Also check out their two studio CD 's with Lawrence Gowan , 2003 's `` Cyclorama '' and 2005 's `` Big Bang Theory . '' Both are awesome .
 Rich arrangements reminescent of the 1940 's , wonderful selection of famous ballads done as they should be , The vocals are emotive and sung only as a singer of this era could . Johnny Desmond happened to be one of the best of those times , though not always recognized commercially . This album captures the sound of the original Army Air Corps band at times . Excellent sound fidelity . For people who appreciate great music , i.e. Sinatra , you 'll probably like this a lot .
 There are two much sought-after albums re-mastered on this Columbia CD released by Sony in 1995 , and Johnny Desmond is in fine voice throughout . The first has Johnny accompanied by an orchestra arranged and directed by Norman Leyden . Both were part of the Glenn Miller USAAF band of the early 1940s as singer and arranger , respectively ; so it 's no surprise that the twelve tracks of ` standards ' on this 1959 release are all very reminiscent of that nostalgic Miller sound . ` All the things you are ' -LRB- Kern & Hammerstein -RRB- , ` Night and day ' -LRB- Porter -RRB- , ` Where or when ' and ` My heart stood still -LRB- both Rodgers & Hart -RRB- , ` I 'll be seeing you ' -LRB- Fain and Kahal -RRB- are just a few of the popular melodies here given the mellow Johnny Desmond treatment . It 's lovely to hear what sounds very like the Miller orchestra itself at times , in stereo.In the second album , dating from 1960 , Johnny Desmond is accompanied by just the guitar of Tony Mottola and the bass playing of Bob Haggart . Haggart is remembered as much as co-composer of ` What 's new ? ' -LRB- with Johnny Burke -RRB- and ` South Rampart Street Parade ' -LRB- with talk show host Steve Allen -RRB- as for his fine jazz playing . This is atmospheric late-night listening music in slow relaxed vein once again of familiar titles , except the album title song which was new to me . A thoroughly enjoyable and welcome reissue .
 Will Friedwald wrote of Desmond , yet he lavishes praise on these two albums which , to me , make his point . Desmond had one of the best pure voices of the pre-WW2 band singers , and the one that called least attention to itself . His time was at the service of the song , as his work with Glenn Miller 's AAF orchestra illustrates . With Columbia he seems to have been forced into its pattern for the 50s
 The two-fer CD `` Once Upon A Time/Blue Smoke '' is simply one of the best vocal albums I have bought within the last ten years.Period.I owned both of them on vinyl -LRB- paying a pretty penny for them -RRB- and it took me a long time to be able to find it on CD . It was well worth it to keep looking . `` Once Upon A Time '' is a collection of recordings with Norman Leyden conducting an orchestra comprised of many of Glenn Miller 's former Army Air Force Band and recording , in stereo , twelve selections that featured Johnny Desmond with Miller during WWII . Recorded in the late ' 50 's , Desmond 's voice had developed a richness that was not present with Miller , Bob Crosby or Gene Krupa . The original arrangements sound wonderful nearly 15 years later and Desmond shows that his was one of the great voices in all of music . `` Blue Smoke '' is a very moody album containing twelve `` torch songs ' . It is recorded with very simple instrumentation
 Paul Kelly is a staple of Australian radio , but sadly , besides `` Dumb Things '' -LRB- featured on some movie soundtrack or other -RRB- , he has n't made it onto American radio . Americans are missing one of the best songwriters available today.He is often compared to Bob Dylan , a pretty valid comparison . Both write intelligent lyrics that tell you a fabulous story . Both can wrangle beautiful melodies out of their guitars . But I think Paul Kelly has a much better voice than Dylan.Paul Kelly has several albums available . `` Under the Sun '' is a fabulous introduction to his music . This album has three of my favourite songs by him
 Sadly , most folks in the U.S. do n't know Paul Kelly . I heard ` Dumb Things ' on 120 Minutes , went out and bought the cassette -LRB- does that date me ? -RRB- and have been a fan ever since . ` Same Old Walk ' is a terrific song , especially the imagery in the line , `` I woke up at the table , the house was burning bright '' . Working-class songs about the everyday stuff in our lives that we do n't stop to think about . Singing ` Barbara Ann ' on a road trip -LRB- Under the Sun -RRB- , falling in love with your best friend and not telling her -LRB- ` Know Your Friends ' -RRB- , sneaking out the back door at dawn -LRB- the terrific ` Do n't Stand So Close to the Window ' -RRB- . I actually think Paul Kelly would appeal to our more open-minded country-western fans , too . I lot of folks do n't realize that Australia has a thriving folk and country-western scene . Some of slang is different , but the songs are still great .
 Paul Kelly has produced a brilliant album in Under The Sun . It really describes life in Australia from humorous - `` Dumb Things '' to Joyous `` 40 Miles To Saturday Night '' to sad `` To Her Door '' . The best track on the album for my money is Bradman . Those in the States may not appreciate how much this man is revered in this country . I guess he could be compared to someone like Babe Ruth in baseball . Through his amazing feats on the cricket field , Bradman lifted the spirits of ordinary Australians during the dark days of the depression and the war years . Kelly tells a masterful story in this song . It really does justice to this monumental figure in Australian cricket . Great album - have a listen ! You wo n't be disappointed .
 This is where it all started for many Kelly fans . It 's wonderful stuff -- Paul 's lyrics on this album are pure working class poetry . The musical style is unashamedly lusty-boy pub-band , unsynthesised -LRB- I remember when music was real ... -RRB- and relentlessly cheerful . Every tune on this album is catchy , and even the dark ones are uplifting . `` Dumb Things '' was the anthem for pre-gen-X , post-baby-boom lost souls . Kelly has honed his lyrical ability since those early days , but his story telling has always been strong.Under the Sun is unmistakably Australian , more so than on later albums . This is particularly obvious on `` Forty Miles to Saturday Night '' and `` To Her Door '' . When Kelly writes about things Australian , he gets it right . There is emotional truth in the detail here , and the music is damn good . Kelly deserves his status as an Australian working-class -LRB- anti- -RRB- hero . CB
 If you are going to buy only one Paul Kelly CD , you may want to begin here . This work is a great building block for others to come .
 This is a must have CD . Pure , generic , pop-rock at its best.It is a shame that Paul Kelly is not really appreciated in this country . I have been a fan for last ten years and have most of the stuff on good old vinyl.This is strongly recommended for anyone who is willing to understand what Australia and Aussies are really about .
 Australian Paul Kelly and his Messengers released `` Under The Sun '' in 1988 . I loved Paul 's first 3 CD 's he released here in America . Kind of a rock-country sound on most of discs . Peter Bull 's keyboards are the main attraction on this set I think . Steve Connolly adds some fine guitar licks here also . Great songs include , `` Dumb Things '' his 2nd hit in America # 16 mainstream rock . `` Same Old Walk '' , `` Big Heart '' , `` Forty Miles To Saturday Night '' , `` Untouchable '' , `` To Her Door '' -LRB- A favorite -RRB- , `` Under The Sun '' , `` Desdemona '' , the banjo rave-up `` Happy Slave '' , `` Crosstown '' , the churchy `` Little Decisions '' and the mournful `` Bicentennial '' . Paul 's still kicking and releasing albums .
 I first heard of Paul Kelly in the 1980 's when my college roommate , who had a knack for bringing home cutting edge music , played me some tracks off of Kelly 's CD ` Under the Sun ' . I was immediately impressed . Each of the 16 tracks highlights Kelly 's song-writing ability , which is truly amazing . Straddling rock , country and folk , with an Australian twist , each song on the CD is a gem . Although he has known chart success in Australia , he has had less success in America , which is a shame since his music is so enjoyable . On a scale from one to ten , I give this CD a ten .
 And sings about them better than anyone else alive . If Bruce Springsteen were Australian ` Born To Run ' would sound like ` Under the Sun ' .
 If I were to select one album to be `` The All-Time Greatest , '' it would have to be Frankie Laine 's BALLADEER . It 's certainly my all-time favorite.Although it was recorded over 40 years ago , not one of the tracks has dated . In fact , one would be hard pressed to even assign this album to a particular era/genre -LRB- as , for instance , one might term an Elvis Presley album `` 60s Style Pop/Rock , '' or a Frank Sinatra Album `` 60s Style Cabaret/Swing '' -RRB- . These tracks might well have been recorded yesterday , or 100 years in the future . They 're just that fresh.Or that much ahead of their time.Which might explain why this album has yet to receive the appreciation it deserves.Ostensibly , this is a collection of folk songs
 If you are only familiar with her later work , you may be surprised at what you find here - there are some similarities but noticeable differences too . Doris began as a jazz singer and end up as an easy listening pop singer . The changes happened in the forties.This European budget release has no booklet but the sound quality is fine for the age of the recordings . So there are no liner notes but the tracks -LRB- with songwriters -RRB- are listed on the back of the jewel case.Some of the tracks were recorded when Doris was with Les Brown and his orchestra although the track listing does not tell you which ones they are . Generally , the first two CD 's here focus on Doris ' solo and duet recordings from 1945 to 1950 while the third CD is dominated by the Les Brown tracks - however , there are some exceptions.Here you will find most of the American hits that Doris and Les had together including their two number ones - Sentimental journey and My dreams are getting better all the time . -LRB- Les Brown had a further number one hit after Doris left his band - obviously not included here -RRB- . At this distance in time , the most famous solo hits are It 's magic -LRB- from 1948 -RRB- and Bewitched -LRB- from 1950 -RRB- - these regularly turn up on compilations of her music , sometimes via re-recordings . The other hits that Doris had in this period seem to have fallen out of favor with the general public -LRB- including Love somebody , a number one hit duet with Buddy Clark -RRB- but I love them . The most recent hit included is I did n't slip I was n't pushed I fell -LRB- from June and July 1950 -RRB- . Up to that point , all Doris ' solo hits are included except one minor hit -LRB- Now that I need you -RRB- . Also included is her duet with Frank Sinatra , Let 's take an old-fashioned walk.Of the less famous songs , I particularly like Enjoy yourself -LRB- in which Doris advises you to allow some time to do just that -RRB- and A chocolate sundae on Saturday night , but there are plenty of other great songs here too.As a budget collection , this is great value for money .
 Doris Day is well featured here in this exellent 3 cd set ! What a great budget price . The msuic is exeelnt and the sound quality fine . every Doris Day fan needs to own thsi , you wo n't find many of these songs elsewhere without having to pay over one hundred dollars for one of the bear box sets . A great Doris Days cd set !!! Full of lot 's of rarities and surprises !!!
 It 's by Paul Kelly - need I say more . Probably our -LRB- Australia 's -RRB- greatest singer/songwriter ever . This CD is definitely a must have for anyone 's music collection , whether a die hard Paul Kelly fan or not . Those who do n't hear it do n't know what they 're missing out on .
 America has Bob Dylan , The U.K. has the Beatles , Canada gave us The Guess Who , Joni Mitchell and Neal Young . Oddly , Australia , the other English speaking country in the world has translated very few artists to the shores of North America . Technically The Bee Gees were Australian . So was Olivia Newton John . Then , there was Men At Work.But Paul Kelly is the iconic Australian answer to Bob Dylan , The Beatles , Neil Young and at times throughout his career he has been the Australian answer to The Byrds , Tom Petty , John Prine , Leonard Cohen and a host of other folk/rock/pop stars . His music runs the gambit from A-Z . If you are not acquainted with Paul Kelly 's body of work , here is another chance as this 2008 compilation is now available in America again . Great pop , rock , folk and country tinged music .
 I have been a huge Paul Kelly since the mid-1980s when a friend -LRB- who owned a record shop -RRB- recommended I check out his music . Considering his stature in Australia , it 's both unfortunate and a bit puzzling that he has n't been more successful in North America . The double CD in this elaborate boxset is a great compilation of his catalogue and will serve as either a great starter for anyone who is unfamilar with his work or a comprehensive collection for longtime fans who simply want a `` best of '' to pop into a player at home , in the car , etc. . The Tshirt , poster and other items are interesting and neat to have but the MAIN reason I shelled out the $ $ $ for this item was the DVD , advertsied as PAL/Region 0 which I understand means it is supposed to play on all DVD players . I have previously purchased other Region 0 DVDs e.g. on Amazon.Co.UK and they played perfectly on all our players i.e. two PCs , four DVD players and a BluRay . To my great disappointment however , this DVD will NOT play on any of these devices . I can not accuse Amazon.com of misrepresenting the product because in fact it is clearly labelled a Region 0 . Sooo ... if like me you are thinking about taking the plunge here to see almost all of Paul Kelly 's video performances , proceed with caution . You will probably end up owning an expensive disc you can not view .
 Quite simply , this CD contains some of the best words and music written in the last two decades . The only pity is that he is not better known in the US . I met him at concerts in Birmingham and Atlanta earlier this year . He is a gracious man and an outstanding artist and performer . You should have this CD in your collection . No doubt .
 For all the fans of Paul Kelly this is a terrific package of all that is good about his music ! From the classic `` To Her Door '' , the distinctly Australian `` Bradman '' , the poetic `` From St Kilda to Kings Cross , to the impossibly sad `` How to Make Gravy '' , his songs relate in a very emotional way to people 's thoughts , feelings , and experiences . P.K. 's music is timeless , and this albumn is a perfect chronology of some of his work , and yet there are so so many other songs he did not/could not include - although I think an albumn of his 50 greatest hits still would n't do justice to Paul Kelly 's greatness !!!
 I was introduced to Paul Kelly 's music while I lived in Australia . It really made an impact on me . I brought it back to the states with me and introduced my friends as well . Everyone agrees he 's a talented artist and much over looked in music . I highly recommend anything by him .
 I was really only familiar with the music on the first disc , but I warmed up to the second disk pretty quickly . Sure , there are some tracks that I wished were on it , but I suppose I could track down the actual discs if I were so inclined .
 What I write here I do n't think I 'll be able to do this CD justice . Paul Kelly is the epitome of singer/songwriters . His songs are about life and he tells things how they are rather than fiction . My personal favourites on this collection of Greatest Hits are ` To Her Door ' , ` How To Make Gravy ' , and ` From Little Things , Big Things Grow ' .
 So you want to start somewhere ? Make this your first stop . Paul Kelly is the one artist all Australians will come back to . No matter where you are , or how you feel , the music is timeless . Forget the charts-with more accomplishments than any other he is up there , standing next to ` TheDon ' .
 This greatest hits is excellent for a historical view of Paul Kelly 's songs - the man has a genius for capturing the little moments in life and making you feel them all over again . Bradman has got to be one of the best cricket songs ever . Dumb Things and Winter Coat are great `` old relationship '' songs ... Listen and feel !
 this is the compilation of kellys best . He has written for some of the worlds top artists , but his best is his own work . It is cool , understated folk/pop with a hard edge .
 Paul Kelly says , in one of his songs , that he is a legend and not a star . This statement could not be more true . Virtually unheard-of outside of Oz , Paul Kelly writes strong lyrics that perfectly capture a moment . `` Songs from the South '' is his greatest-hits compilation , released in 1997 . Besides his Australian chart-toppers such as `` Dumb Things '' and `` To Her Door '' , it includes his songs that have become more popular over time such as `` Bradman '' and `` How to Make Gravy '' . Spanning Kelly 's extensive career , this album provides an excellent introduction to his music . This album is a near-permanent resident in my CD player at work . My officemate , who rarely agrees with my taste in music , has become a fan of the evocative lyrics found on this album.Paul Kelly has perfected the art of capturing a moment in a song . `` When I First Met Your Ma '' is a most unlikely love song , with a man telling his child how the man met his wife , the boy 's mother . `` Deeper Water '' is a touching vignette of a man growing up , marrying , having children , and losing his wife to cancer . `` Everything 's Turning to White '' is based on the short story `` So Much Water So Close to Home '' by Raymond Carver.If you are not familiar with his music , this is an excellent introduction . However , since this album is only available as an import , it is n't the cheapest way to learn more about this singer-songwriter . Some of Kelly 's work has been released in the US , and is thus easier and cheaper to purchase . If this price is a bit too stiff for you , try the US release of `` Deeper Water '' from 1995 , or the upcoming US release of his most recent album , `` Nothing But a Dream '' -LRB- due in early 2002 -RRB- .
 Summer of 1993 , I 'm in an Sydney Record Shop , a Long , Long way from Home on Vacation in the middle of Wintertime -LRB- July -RRB- . I 've already found some Good Stuff -LRB- Killing Time , Men at Work -RRB- . I ask one of the Clerks what 's good and She tells me
 Great singer-songwriters are poets
 Paul Kelly is without doubt Australia 's greatest singer songwriter . His songs main strength is the evocative power of his lyrics to describe situations and experiences that all of us feel . This is a best of CD and has his finest recordings from his career so far . The only missing song of any note is `` other peoples houses '' . Each of these songs has something special . `` From little things big things grow '' is the story of the first grant of land to Aboriginal people in Australia . One would think that it is rather too dry a subject for a song , yet it is so well crafted that I dare anyone to hear it and not be moved . `` When I first met your ma '' one of the most evocative descriptions of love to be recorded . Bradman , not so much a song about a great sportsman but a song about our respect for an age long gone and the sorts of heroes that came from it . The last song on the CD how to make the gravy was never released as a single but again is one of the more moving that Kelly has recorded . This is the treasure house of a national treasure .
 For all y' all Americans , PAul Kelly is probably an unknown . That 's a pity - he 's something very rare and special.It 's hard to put a finger on what makes Kelly so good . His voice is distinctive sure , but its not very pretty - or strong for that matter . He play 's guitar , even harmonica , but again do n't expect anyhtng much other than a few open chords in his songs.It 's as a songwriter that Kelly makes his mark . His songs are catchy , often instantly appealing and resonant . They sound familiar . Many remind me of my childhood through the 80 's - like old friends.Tracks like `` From St Kilda to Kings Cross ' , ` Before too long ' , ` Dumb things ' , ` Too her door ' and ` Lover never runs on time ' are very special to me for this reason.Kelly dabbles in Rock , Pop , and Folk in this collection . He is convincing and honest . I saw that Kevin Bloody Wilson is outselling him at Amazon.com - that 's a crime ; this CD deserves so much more .
 Paul Kelly is the finest rock/folk artist I have ever had the pleasure of listening to . Every song hits a chord with a certain emotion or memory whereby the songs become a conduit for thought and musing . Some songs have a Beatlesuqe feel and others bring Dylan to mind but Kelly 's lyrics and his unique voice make the music clearly his own . He can menacing like on `` Give In To My Love '' or `` Before Too Long '' and poignant like on `` Winter Coat or `` To Her Door '' . This album should be on every music lovers ' top albums of the century list .
 As an expatriate Australian , nothing takes me home to Melbourne like Paul Kelly . From the very fist few bars of From St Kilda to Kings Cross , I am transported to `` The Armadale Hotel '' in Melbourne listening to Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls . Whenever I have the need for nostalgia , I grab this CD . I just now wish that someone would approach him about a tour to Dubai !
 This CD is so great it has n't left my stacker in the car ! Paul Kelly is just the quintessential aussie , and this CD always makes me feel like i 'm home -LRB- even though there 's 3ft of snow around ! -RRB- If you want to experience australiana , this CD is for you , if your home-sick , this CD is also for you !
 Paul Kelly is considered the Bard/Dylan/Springsteen of Australia , and this CD set provides ample support for those comparisons . Kelly uses words sparingly to evoke time , place , and emotions better than any songwriter I 've heard . His best songs are little vignettes
 Songs From the South , Volumes 1 & 2
 Think Boards of Canada , yet a little more ` immature ' as in ; more playful and less strict , but with comparisions in atmosphere and ambiance , recognizable melodies and unconscious attraction . Think instant satisfaction as in Vitalic , without the power , rather the beforementioned playfulness and the noticable freshness.These comparision are big , I know . You got to show something immense to measure up to these . Nathan Fake does it.I popped my cd in , I was waiting for something extemely average since I never seen any exposure or much of critical acclaim surrounding this record.Sure , people say `` This stuff is pretty good '' . But ` pretty good ' is almost equal to ' I quite like it , but I have thousand of records I 'd rather hear ' . ` Pretty good ' does n't do this record any justice.As soon as the record started playing , I knew I hit the jackpot . How can something like this still be a secret these days ? I am pretty picky if it comes to music , and sure , this does n't have a life-changing impact , but if `` Drowning In A Sea of Love '' does n't reach any ` Top 5 of 2006 ' lists this year I certainly lost my faith in today 's music listeners.The playfulness of `` Stops '' , the nostalgia of `` Charlie 's House '' , the epic feel of `` The Sky Was Pink '' and the comfort of `` You Are Here '' , it 's all there . There are no fillers , the quality among the tracks are almost equally brilliant , and each mood can be satisfied with at least one of these songs.It 's a bit short , I admit . You can only dream of a record like this being longer . It 's a shame Amazon could n't get there hands on some samples , because I 'm sure any clip from one of these songs would be outstanding.Perhaps this music is right up my alley , perhaps it 's just the disappointment I 'm trying to fill for 2006 's music line-up , or perhaps this record is just remarkably good . I think it 's the last .
 ` Drowning in a Sea of Love ' is the inevitable result of Fake 's basement-style scientific experimentations . He was n't just being sarcastic when he produced ` Bored of House ' in 2004 . The beat and synth samples throughout this debut album are quite fresh . The way he tweeks and plays with tempo loops before a break for example is also somewhat unprecedented . This entire sound is very fresh . If you wish to escape into an interesting , colorful , and deep environment , get this album , or any of the Border Community productions for that matter.N O W
 every song is a gem . if you like this , check out other border community stuff . if you dont , go fake yourself .
 The Square Pegs sound great in this absolutely wonderful selection of songs , many from the 1920 's -LRB- my favorite era -RRB- . The group blends well together and the harmonies are not forced.I especially appreciate their version of Paul Whiteman 's hit , `` Whispering . '' Tea for Two and `` A Cuppa Coffee '' are superb , as is the well-loved classic , `` Lida Rose . `` I do not sing barbershop , so my expertise is limited -LRB- though I attend the annual concert in my town -RRB- , but as a listener I am well satisfied with this CD .
 There 's a simple reason this CD is called `` The best of Barbershop Quartet . '' And that is that this is one of the best Compilations of close-harmony quartets I 've ever heard . Definitely a CD worth hearing !
 Seems Leer evolved quite a bit from his days collaborating with Robert Rental and recording lo-fi synth-soul in his bedroom . This disc , from 84 , is very slick . You can almost hear the very same Fairlight sounds usedby Trevor Horn in his productions for the Art of Noise and Propaganda.However , most of these tracks are minimal in construction . ` Memories of Reason ' and ` International ' are the gems here , but the other tracks do grow on you after repeated listens . Leer never goes for the big chorus or obvious hook . His vocals just float on top of the chugging electro-rhythms . Is this synth-pop perfection ? Certainly not -- this disc is a bit more cerebral than most . I can see why this thing was never a big-seller in the U.K. because it just does n't hit the mark most of the time.If you 're buying this , you know who Leer is an what he 's capable of . This is Leer at his most polished . A good disc that belongs in the collectionof those who want a little more from their mid-80 's synthesizer pop . For ` memories of reason ' alone it is worth the purchase .
 I bought this on lp when it came out and it was quite a revelation.excellent electonica by one of the real pioneers .
 This album is precious electronic synth from the 80 's . I saw Leer in 1981 and the track International is beautiful . THe sound of of the style council meets pete shelly with a bit of M. Great cd .
 This Album contains five versions of a rousing energetic song written for the Champions Clothes Company Inc. . This fine piece of work will allow you to achieve anything you dream -LRB- within the world of selling clothes -RRB- I must say thinking of a huge seminar with thousands of employees for Champion and this playing on loudspeakers to the crowd as the company theme song is quite a wonderful image . Tresure this album because Right Said Fred is anyhting but a corporate composer only producing one song for money - This is his career !!!!
 The Columbia Two-for-one series provides incomparable quality and value-for-money for anyone who wants easy listening CDs and this album is no exception . Johnny Mathis was at the top of the tree for over four decades and this double -LRB- original -RRB- album of classic songs showcases some his best recordings . The fabulous track-list includes some of the biggest hits of the 60 's -LRB- and of all time -RRB- and Mathis has never been in better voice.His version of the Elvis hit ` Something ' , although a little too short is probably the best there is whilst ` Honey come back ' is also emotionally peerless . I could get carried away with a description of every song as ` the best
 Thank you so much for allowing me to collect some of the music I had years ago and for some reason could no longer find . I 'm not much of a downloader , so it is nice to just be able to play what I want to hear . Thanks again !
 Do you remember the great rendition of Milonga Triste from the movie The Tango Lesson ? That was Hugo Diaz , and that piece is on the album `` Hugo Diaz en Buenos Aires . '' That Hugo Diaz was a harmonica player , and the Hugo Diaz of Trio Hugo Diaz is a Uraguayan master bandoneonist . Harmonicas and bandoneons have a different sound . Do n't buy this disk if you think the harmonica player Hugo Diaz produced it.I like the instrumentation of the Trio Hugo Diaz . In a tango ensemble , there is a certain amount of improvisation and give-and-take between the bandone&oacute;n , the double bass , and the piano . The Hugo Diaz Trio does a good job in this regard . It reminds me of a jazz band in how they work together . If you consider tango to be a form of jazz , you already understand this concept . It works well when the band has a certain chemistry or `` je ne sais quoi . '' You know it when you hear it , and you enjoy it.This is the traditional tango music composed by Castillo , Gardel , Fresedo , Troilo , Martinez , Juan de Dios Filberto , etc. . It has a unique sound . My first question
 Everyone who knows me knows I love this guy , everything he puts out everything he puts his name on is golden in my book . Yes , I agree it 's outragous to spend $ 12.00 on two songs , when you only have to spend $ 9.00 and you get seven , but these two songs are brilliant . So , despite the price and the fact you can get them elsewhere and cheaper at that , the music is what we 're grading here and the music is brilliant . ` Cannonball ' is one of the best songs on ` O ' and ` Moody Mooday ' is one of the best songs on ` B-Sides ' . There you go , ample reason to love this single hands-down . Damien Rice puts so much into his music , so much feeling and emotion and he just lets this melt off his lips in the most engrossingly provocative way . I just ca n't get enough , and I 'm sure you wo n't be able to either !
 The talent of Frankie Lane is appealing to audiences of all ages . Those of us who have experienced many sunsets know the richness of his tenor and those who experience Frankie for the first time in this collection are in for a treat . This is the best of the best and not just for nostalgia .
 I caught Paul Melancon 's version of the Beatle 's ` Another Day ' on the unsigned station of XM Radio . I thought it was one of the best covers I 've ever heard , so I immediately went online to find out more about him.I 've had this CD for a month now and I still listen to it every time I get in the car . This guy has an amazing voice . He can do upbeat and rocking -LRB- Guy Fawkes Day -RRB- or smooth and haunting -LRB- Slumberland -RRB- . Good music has good lyrics and a good melody ; this is great music.What else can I say ? The only thing I would change is the length - I 'd be happy if the CD were twice as long as it is .
 Once in my cd player it stayed there for weeks . This is an amazing ep . Every song is fabulous . I had Another Day in my head for days , and then Guy Fawkes Day replaced it for a week more . It 's pop at its best . It 's a must have for any pop lover .

 I stumbled on Paul 's music on a site for musicians to exchange reviews on each others music . The first track I heard was Slumberland , and I was absolutely floored . Eventually I went ahead and bought the CD , and I was floored again . I do n't think I could name twenty five albums -LRB- of all time -RRB- better than this seven song EP . There is n't one moment of down time . Paul Melancon , is at the top of his game in every aspect . His lyrics are witty , bright and beautiful . The music is tight and inspiring . And the melodies are unbelievably catchy without ever seeming somehow re-hashed or ingenuine . This CD has already found a place in `` Best of All Time '' list for me , and I hope dearly that I get to hear a lot more from Paul Melancon .
 Formerly of the band Radiant City , Paul Melancon has put together that rarest of things . He has created an album with not one song below par on it . In fact they are all excellent ! I genuinely ca n't say I 've heard a better album from any artist in the last 5 years . Here 's hoping the `` powers that be '' discover this talented artist soon so that more people can be exposed to his mellifluous voice and endearing , insightful lyrics . Buy this album!That is all ...
 Here 's a record that cleverly outwits Parental Guidelines by falling into a musical category that no warning label exists for
 From the lilting ukulele intro of `` Slumberland '' to the driving bounce of `` Guy Fawkes Day '' this EP is definitely a pop must-have . It has intelligent , clever lyrics and fantastic music all wrapped up in a voice that whispers venom disguised as sweet nothings . There is n't a bad song on this album . It left me wanting more ! The surprise cover of `` Another Day '' stuck in my head for days . I hope to hear a full-length CD soon .
 Paul Melancon is a true pop music craftsman.He does not get bogged down by perfunctionary -LRB- is that a word ? -RRB- music to back his witty lyrics or try to outsmart us with `` quirky '' and `` jagged '' chord progressions.He is also not bogged down by a slacker cum idiosynchratic singing style so often accompanying those more pseudo-intellectual than us - he puts his belt on before he goes to work.Calculated risks and everything pays off beautifully.This style of production is a rarity these days.I 'm glad someone hates compression as much as I do.Not quaker oats-instant or maytag blue cheese-garlic and dill infused , throw him in your good ol' homeade mashed potatoes.As American sounding as Wings at it 's best.I 've seen him live and , beleive you me , -LRB- I love saying that -RRB- , he 's got the goods.And the new songs I 've heard not on this disc are right in line.Great guy , too.Too early to throw him into the `` greats '' . Let 's wait and call it `` up and coming '' - with a bullet .
 This CD is one of my favorites ever . It is the only CD I have right now at work , and while I usually like some variety I have not burned out on this CD despite listening to it literally hundreds of times . I am very anxious for the next release . Paul Melancon is a musical genius just waiting to be discovered . I expect we will be hearing a lot more about him very soon .
 The fact is , THIS IS A GREAT CD . I mean I could talk about how great it is to hear an artist with an original sound or say things like `` every track was good if not great '' and `` after the first time through , I had to hit the repeat button on my CD player '' or `` the most bang for my music buying buck I have gotten in years . '' While all that is true , it is n't as important as the fact that THIS IS A GREAT CD . So I wait for more from Paul Melancon , and I hope that you do to .
 I first heard of Paul Melancon via an ELO mail list . He wrote a song called `` Jeff Lynne '' -LRB- the founder of ELO -RRB- which will be on his new CD due in September . All I can say is this guys rocks ! Catchy hooks , terriffic melodies and superb production values make each song easy to listen to over and over again . I predict that when Paul gets noticed he 'll be big . Help him out ! Buy this CD and get his new one coming out this summer . Also check out his website ... to check out his latest work . You wo n't be disappointed ! P.S. No , I do n't work for him . It 's just that good !
 I bught this cd by a fortuitous recommendation here in Amazon . . I was also in the mood to experiment those artist not too well known , this ia a great finding a true collector 's gem.The only question is Why is it Paul , that you are depreiving us of more cds ???
 This is the perfect combination of Gregorian Chant with sounds of nature . What a bargain this was ! If you can find it at a better price , they 're giving it away .
 Pianist John Hicks has long been a master of the modern mainstream without necessarily blazing any new paths of his own . On this CD he is featured on a pair of solo numbers , a duet with flutist Elise Wood -LRB- a sensitive version of Duke Ellington 's `` Star Crossed Lovers '' -RRB- , a trio rendition -LRB- with bassist Curtis Lundy and drummer Cecil Brooks III . -RRB- of `` Mood Swings , '' with a quintet -LRB- a blazing version of `` My Shining Hour '' that has both Bobby Watson and Vincent Herring on altos -RRB- and five selections with the full sextet . Four standards follow six obscurities -LRB- including Charles Mingus ' `` Diane '' -RRB- . Hicks , who often shows off the influence of McCoy Tyner 's voicings , has never recorded an uninspired record and this one is better than average for him . Due to the variety of moods , instrumental colors and settings , the music is continually interesting and well worth acquiring .
 Tom Constanten is such an amazing keyboardist , that trying to use the word `` tasteful '' to describe him seems stale . He can amazingly recreate popular pieces to a new realm of `` class '' with his fingers . His approach to performing is as close to perfect as one can get . He has a joyous personality , with many awesome tales to tell - he 's a master of knowledge of the early DEAD days and you can sense the shine of his eyes as he tells them . Then he plays piano for you and takes off into incredible themes and montages he has arranged of other 's works and material he performed back in the day with the DEAD . A masterful live set . This man needs to be played in elevators everywhere . The world would be a better place .
 This is a truly excellent set by TC , which should particularly appeal to those who prefer his , um , er , `` straight '' stuff -- as opposed to more experimental stuff with Henry Kaiser , et . al. . A record that any piano enthusiast will like , not to mention the Deadhead crowd . Check it out !
 I am amazed , Tom is the best pianst you will ever run across . This cd is soo good ! Tom is a friend of mine I have heard him play other songs , but beleve me . . this is a wonderful cd !!
 I 've waited about 30 years to get Swing Softly on CD , and it was very wise to pair this up with the glorious `` Warm '' album , both arranged and conducted by the legendary Percy Faith . The title cut from `` Warm '' ranks right up there with `` Misty '' for Mathis fans . The orchestrations are lush and dreamy . Johnny does a beautiful turn with `` I 've Grown Accustomed to Her Face '' and you feel as if you 've heard the song for the very first time.On `` Swing Softly '' its nice to see this serious singer just having fun ! Johnny Mathis has often added the often-forgotten `` intros '' on songs to his recordings , and on `` It 's De-Lovely '' you can tell he 's making great fun of himself . `` I 've Got the World on a String '' is another one of those tunes you 've heard hundreds of times before , but a singer like Johnny Mathis adds that little something extra making it new again . With 24 cuts of beautiful music , this 2-CD set is a great buy !
 This double album is a prime example of Johnny 's style . The romantic standards of Warm and the swing standards of Swing Softly are a must for anyone who loves this wonderful style of music . Johnny'arrangements almost always include the verse , so you get to hear ALL the song , not just the refrain . I bought the Swing Softly LP as a teenager and it is as fresh today as it was 40 years ago . No one does it better and this CD is the proof of that . Thanks , Amazon for finding it .
 `` Warm '' was my very first album when I received my first `` Hi-Fi '' set . It is glorious , romantic music - one of Johnny Mathis ' first few albums released . I have searched record stores for this CD but this is the only place I have found it . Lush , tender love songs . 5 Stars !
 This was the third album Mathis made for Columbia , and in my opinion , is the best work he has ever done . The album includes some wonderful standards and two songs that were new when the album was recorded . There is n't a dog among them ! His mood ranges from wistful on `` I 've Grown Accustomed to Her Face '' to confident on `` By Myself '' . It is difficult to pick a favorite among these songs but , after many plays , my choice is `` I 'm Glad There is You '' . -LRB- I originally purchased this album on 33 LP back in the late 50 's and I 've been trying to find it on CD for years . -RRB- The arrangements by Percy Faith are flawless and complement Johnny 's singing perfectly . Johnny is in great voice for this album which gives credence to the first line of `` While We 're Young '' . All Mathis fans should love this album . The second album , `` Swing Softly '' is good too and shows Johnny 's versatility , however , `` Warm '' is far and away the better .
 I 'll hold my judgement on `` Warm '' as I 've never listened to it but `` Swing Softly '' is the best thing Mathis ever did . If he could only go back to these kind of songs & arrangements . This is truly nightclub atmosphere , you can just imagine a smoke filled room and a highball in your hand and your girlfriend/wife in a slinky dress & Mathis & Percy Faith swinging through these standards . You Hit the Spot , It ' Delovely , This Heart of Mine , To Be in Love are highlights though there ai n't a bad one in the bunch . The arrangements are tight & man this just swings . If you like jazz , get this !
 Two albums on 1 CD , just the English way . Very good . Here you have Mathis with arrangements by famous Percy Faith on both albums . Programs include uptempo swing on `` Swing Softly '' and romantic ballads on `` Warm '' . If you dont know , `` Warm '' is a million seller album by Mathis . Buy it now .
 Waited over 35 years to hear both records -LRB- on CD now -RRB- and what a joy to listen to this CD Thanks Sony special products or Columbia The Legacy ! Enjoy every track of the CD
 I 'm going to get a mohawk and carry my Mossberg 500 -LRB- unloaded , but who will know ? -RRB- right inside . When they ask for my order , I 'll pull that cold black steel out of my trenchcoat and say , `` Go away , and do n't come back until the topless car wash reopens . '' That 'll learn 'em . Real solid album . Ice on prickly heat . A really sweaty day in a borrowed wedding dress . Korbel and Kraft Macaroni and Cheese . You know the feeling . The one where you step off the suffocating city bus and find a cool breeze in the Sycamore trees . Sounds like that pale yellow in the black clouds before a terrific thunderstorm.Darn , I 've said too much already . Just go to the Southgate House .
 Kris Kristofferson 's voice has sometimes been compared to a `` croaking '' frog . So , it is fitting that some of the best singers and Kris 's friends should pay tribute to Kris and his 70th birthday by `` breathing new life into his tunes '' . `` Kristofferson was never much for easy . For most of his life , he craved both desperation and accomplishment . Or maybe he craved the kind of accomplishment that can only spring from desperation . Anyway , he threw himself into worlds of bruised-hearted trouble , of excess and alcohol and worry and peril . That everything all worked out in the end is one measure of the man . `` All alone all the way on your own / Who 's to say that you 've thrown it away for a song ? '' he once sang . Well , plenty of people said that about him . '' an interviewer said of him.This CD is everything The Legend would want ; The producers selected Kristofferson 's best songs and chose some major singers to interpret them . Willie Nelson , Roseanne Cash , Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell are so well known and would ensure the quality of this CD . But , it is the lesser knowns that enliven this CD - just wait til you hear , BK.Kris Kristofferson opens `` The Pilgrim
 Kris Kristofferson is one of the true treasures of American music . I was skeptical when I purchased this disc , because I grew up with his renditions of these songs , but to my surprise , this was one of the best tribute albums I have heard.The artists , for the most part nail the songs . Standout cuts include Shooter Jennings -LRB- son of the late great Waylon Jennings and Jessie Colter -RRB- singing `` The Silver Tongued Devil and I '' , Rosanne Cash 's version of `` Lovin ' Him was Easier -LRB- Than Anything I 'll Ever Do Again -RRB- ' , Emmylou Harris -LRB- has she ever sung anything less than perfect ? -RRB- covering `` The Pilgrim
 It 's hard to make a tribute album , especially for an artist whose impact is as wide-spread and influential as Kris Kristofferson 's . His songs have touched millions the world over , whether voiced by himself or his contempories ; his songs have woven lyrical tapestries that graced mainstream and alternative music scenes alike ; few artists have had the impact Kristofferson has , and those who have -- say , Johnny Cash , Willie Nelson , Bob Dylan -- were proud to call themselves his friends.THE PILGRIM
 Never put Emmylou Harris at the beginning of a tribute album , because you are n't going to top that track -- and this is true here as well , as she turns in a warm and affectionate `` Pilgrim . '' The next track that comes to her level is Willie Nelson 's `` The Legend , '' and both the songs and the singers provide fitting bookends to this cd . Most of the songs glide along on a steady folk-rock/singer-songwriter vibe which is fitting for the material . For this reason Brian McKnight 's `` Me and Bobbie McGee '' feels jarringly out of place , but listened to on its own it is quite a good track . Russell Crowe benefits from the overall flow , fitting in nicely with an Irish inflected `` Darby 's Castle '' -LRB- and allowing the listener to see reviewers fitingly tribute Kristofferson 's early reviews -LRB- heee -RRB- -RRB- . And , to be fair , he does turn in a more convincing performance than either of the two mainstream country singers -- Shooter Jennings who takes The Silver Tongued Devil way too seriously and Gretchen Wilson who makes Sunday Morning Coming Down sound like the night after a Zima bender . Rodney Crowell turns in a sweet performance on Come Sundown . Todd Snider finds his spiritual and musical home on Maybe You Heard . Rosanne Cash 's `` Loving Him Was Easier '' is simply stunning and Bruce Robison and Kelly Willis are not to be missed . Marshall Chapman turns in a joyous Jesus Was A Capricorn . In fact , the albums only real mis-step in the plodding and dull `` For The Good Times '' by Lloyd Coleman and Jill Sobule . All in all a great collection for any Kristofferson fan .
 ALthough I 'm not a huge Kristofferson fan , I heard a few tracks on the local FM station and decided to give this cd a try . -LRB- Thanks to the previous reviews here also -RRB- . I 'm glad I spent the $ $ $ . The cd as a whole creates a mellow mood . The lyrics are n't over wrought by the performers . I think the producer did a wonderful job of maintaining an overall feel without restricting the artists own styles.There are a few tracks I 'm not fond of -LRB- very subjective -RRB- but I know that I will listen to this cd many times over the next decade . With our ability to create our own playlists for ipods etc. , I do n't see the point in quibbling over a few tracks . How often are there 15/18 songs on a cd that you truly enjoy ?
 Most `` Tribute '' cuts are not as I envisioned , but this one is fantastic !! Each Artist gives Kris ' songs a different Life than the ones I have embedded in my mind . I have loved Kris and his songs for over 28 years , and have worn out plastic vinyl , 8 tracks , cassettes and other mediums listening to Kris ! He 's my Number One Artist , and the `` Tribute '' extends my Love for Kris and his music ! Great Job Producers !!
 From Kris 's gravelly introduction to the last song on the album , it is a wonderful interpretation of his songs . A good variety and I ca n't stop listening to it .
 I do n't think there is a bad one in the bunch ! Made my top 30 folk releases of 2006 list .
 but this one I actually listen to . Marta Gomez makes ` The Circle ' beautiful and compelling , Rodney Crowell 's verson of ` Come Sundown ' is perfect , Marshal Chapman does a great ` Jesus was a Capricorn ' . Those are my favorites , but on the entire album , there is n't one song that I skip . Highly recommended .
 The beauty of Kristofferson 's poetry is done justice by this collection of talented artists . Particular gems are The Pilgrim by Emmylou Harris , Sunday Morning Coming Down by Gretchen Wilson , and Come Sundown by Rodney Crowell . There are a couple that I would have considered other singers to perform but that is quibbling . It is clear these singers appreciated the call to interpret these beautiful songs . A great tribute to the master songwriter of the past 35 years .
 The product is what I expected . It arrived on time and in the condition advertised .
 Number one , Russell Crowe need to stick to acting . He ca n't sing . -LRB- Well , Kris ca n't either but at least his voice has something that holds on to you . -RRB- Number two , Brian McKnight on Bobby McGee ?? That 's just plain w-r-o-n-g . I ca n't stand to listen to it.Otherwise , the rest of it is just fantastic .
 These two albums have been -LRB- thankfully -RRB- put on one CD . Doris is at her best here , particularly with sassy renditions of `` Cheek to Cheek '' and `` Easy to Love . '' The title song , with its slow beginning to its jazzy ending , is sung by Doris in an ironic and humorous manner ; even the composer admits that her rendition of `` Horray for Hollywood '' is the best version by any singer . On Volume 2 , she sings wistfully of `` It Might As Well Be Spring '' and `` Three Coins in the Fountain '' as well sings coyly `` Nice Work If You Can Get It '' and `` I 've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm . '' Also , `` Over the Rainbow '' and `` Blues in the Night '' are stand-outs .

 The enigma that is Show of Hands is back with this stunner of a studio album that makes you question once again why they 're dabbling in the backwaters when they could knock spots of many mainstream music icons.Perhaps it 's because Devon 's independent acoustic music duo are simply indefinable . Recently crowned `` Best Live Act '' in BBC Radio 2 's 2004 Folk Awards they may have been -LRB- the only category voted for by the great British public ! -RRB- but much of this is nothing like the folk I 've ever heard.Steve Knightley 's `` windswept '' voice -LRB- which bears more than a passing resemblance to Springsteen 's in some numbers -RRB- and astonishing and prolific song writing skills are matched only by Phil Beer 's awesome multi-instrumental prowess - fiddle , slide guitar , Spanish guitar , cuatro , mandocello , melodeon , percussion - in fact give that man any instrument and he 'll play you a tune . Add to that Beer 's distinctive and contrasting voice and Knightley 's own mastery of cuatro , concertina , mandocello and bass and you 're simply tripping over talent.The songs of this professional , self-assured duo can transport you through history , countries and time and Knightley actually sings songs as well as he writes them - a rare combination.They can get audiences singing epic , anthemic numbers and then spill out some raw-edged relationship song or a witty number for good measure.To see them live is an unforgettable and uplifting experience , whether the `` hall '' they are playing is of the village or Royal Albert variety . But the next best thing is to buy this album , which does n't have a lacklustre song on it . Their most ambitious project to date it boasts 10 new titles from the mighty Knightley repertoire plus his arrangements of two traditional folk songs and Kelly Joe Phelps 's harrowing `` Tommy '' - the tale of a misfit.This is music on an inspired and intelligent level . The title track is a stirring , defiant and finely-honed rant about the desecration of British country life -LRB- too political to play on some radio stations apparently -RRB- and contains some of Knightley 's finest lyrics - the `` agri barons CAP in hand '' line is a gem . An accompanying promo CD shows this track recorded in a Devon barn with a full band line-up including one time Rolling Stones keyboard player Matt Clifford . Only a diehard townie could fail to be moved with the imagery this acoustic rock number creates of cattle burning in the foot and mouth pyres and village cottages turned into empty shells of holiday homes . '' No trains , no jobs , no shops , no pubs - what went wrong with country life ? '' bawls Knightley as Phil Beer turns up the tempo with some dazzling fiddle playing.From this `` in your face '' number -LRB- and Show of Hands are never afraid to be political -RRB- they set off to strut their showcase of music as the mood changes instantly to the sweet song about long standing friendship `` Hard Shoulder '' followed by the sublime Spanish guitar playing of Beer in the wonderful `` Suntrap '' and the poignant and gentle Smile She Said which tells of the journey of a relationship in five '' exposures . `` The traditional lyrics of Reynardine -LRB- Fairport did a memorable version of this song akin to the werewolf legend -RRB- are set to the haunting music of Knightley . He is a past master of the shiver-down-the-spine song -LRB- as heard in Widecombe Fair -RRB- and this is no exception as he starts his hallmark finger drumming , this time on the cuatro -LRB- an instrument he was taught by exiled Chilean musician Vladamir Vega -RRB- . The fine voice of 15-year-old West Country singer Jenna Witts complements Steve 's in the easy on the ear ballad Seven Days before the mood changes once again to the raw song of Tommy featuring Beer 's unusual voice . The first half of the album is probably the strongest but that 's not to detract from more jaunty tracks like Be Lucky , the traditional folk song Adieu Sweet Lovely Nancy -LRB- another vehicle for Beer -RRB- , the gentle I Promise You and the reflective concert closer Do n't Be a Stranger . And then there 's the upbeat Red Diesel - many people must know a man like the Yuppie-hating , hooch-making , car-mending Terry of this song and it contains another brilliant Knightley lyric `` He says he sang a folk song once but he did n't inhale ! `` I have racked my brains for a way to describe this band and failed . And therein lies the `` riddle '' of Show of Hands . Just when you think you 've got a handle on them and decided it 's `` acoustic with attitude '' or out and out English folk they 'll throw in some rock , shades of country , a reel of Celtic , a bit of bluegrass and then recreate the sitar sounds of India in the blink of an eye . They are the coolest chameleons I 've seen ... and the release of Country Life proves they just get better and better .
 I love this group , saw them in England in 2005 , going to see them summer of 2007 ! Outstanding live performance , both are gifted musicians . Miranda that sings with them now is talented as well . Their songs are about real issues and towns and villages in the West Country , but you can relate to them even if you are n't from their . I play their music in the car and house and my kids can sing along to just about every song . - sorry , but most radio station songs are all about sex and conquests , enough of that garbage . Give me 3 folk singers in a pub near Wells any day !!!
 I 'm a huge fan of Damien Rice and feel I have to own every CD , no matter how small , that he puts out . He does have quite a few single released , but this one is special in it 's own right . It sports three of the best tracks off of ` O ' but their live tracks so if you have n't had the chance to see Damien live yet -LRB- much like myself !!! -RRB- then you 'll enjoy this disc very much . ` Cannonball ' is a beautiful love song as is ` Amie ' and ` Blowers Daughter ' , but ` Cannonball ' has a sense of uplifting comfort in it 's lyrics as well as delivery , while both ` Amie ' and ` Blowers Daughter ' convey a sense of loss and distress . All three are just beautiful tracks , and these live cuts add an extra layer of appreciation to Damien and his music .
 I love Damien Rice and had always been looking for this with the rare instrumental version on it . Had it and I love it . That will be played at my wedding someday .
 This two-on-one album is absoulutely a masterpiece . If you would like an instrumental excursion into a warm , quiet , sunset , sit back and listen to Faiths landmark albums .
 I 've been waiting for Columbia/SONY to finally wake up and release this album on CD . I got so tired of waiting , in fact , that I had a friend of mine with a CD recorder copy my vinyl version of it ! That was BEFORE Columbia made its move . These two are positively wonderful to listen to . Faith , with his brilliant recording engineer Harold Chapman , made Broadway Bouquet one of the finest easy-listening recordings in the catalog . Country , which came along a little later , was still beautifully recorded , representing Faith 's limitless talent at crafting musical arrangements to fit an evolving music scene . Get yourself a glass of Courvoisier , unplug the phone , and listen to this CD . It 'll take you to places you thought were long gone .
 This is about the best cd I 've heard by Percy Faith.This cd contains a lot of hard to find songs by this artist such as For the good times , The most beautiful girl , I see your eyes before me and Help me make it through the night just to name a few.These are the songs that beautiful music stations used to play and you could n't find them on cd until this cd come out.The most beautiful girl is the country version that Charlie Rich made popular , not the broadway version the most beautiful girl in the world.This is strictley instrumental with lush strings as is every song on this cd.One more song I must mention is Annie 's song.This is one of the most beautiful versions I 've ever heard.You ca n't go wrong with this cd if you like beautiful music especially now since you ca n't find it on the radio anymore .
 The superb instrumental quality music and compositions of percy faith has truly immersed me to continue looking for all his complete albums.It gives me great satisfaction during my meditative moments to enjoy his quality music especially his two bouquet albums.enjoy !
 MESSENGER MAN
 The reviewer below is right on the money . In fact , the guitar solo he mentioned is , IMHO , the ALL-TIME WORST GUITAR SOLO ON RECORD ! It 's an unfortunate combination of impossibly awful taste and complete incompatibility with the song . -LRB- Actually there are TWO concurrent solos , each stepping all over the other , to make it even more obnoxious . -RRB- I 'd love to be able to separate the tracks to pull the ugliness out and enjoy the music . Otherwise , some fine grooves though , and soulful singing from Mr. Williams ...
 A truly masterful work of music . Everything about this album is extraordinary . Definitely a true gem .
 Arguably the greatest ragtime cd ever released . Basta has set the standard -LRB- in my book -RRB- for all others to be measured by . Fantastic packaging including 4 compact discs with 2 substantial booklets of heavily detailed information on Joplin 's life and music . Majestic and true , Nielsen plays on a full , in-tune grand piano , which means you wo n't hear any heavy reverb or digital piano harshness found on other recordings . Gone are the numerous trills and improvised passages at speeds not befitting the orignal score . Also missing are the arm garters and straw boater undermining Joplin 's music and influence . With all due respect to Rifkin , Zimmerman , Arpin etc. , this release is without equal . Filled with extraodinary music , liner notes , photos and artwork by Chris Ware , it is an amazing achievement .
 Wow ! The only words that can truly describe this set are exclamations . Mr. Guido Nielsen has done it again . The music is played as written , in a style that is accurate , fresh , and lively . The performances are excellent , although classics like ` Gladiolus Rag ' and ` Magnetic Rag ' could be played somewhat slower . The cover design is exquisite and the discs themselves are simply beautiful . The two 24-page booklets are crammed with color and black-and-white photographs , not to mention notes of the highest quality . Be sure to read the entertaining advertisements on the last page of the second booklet . I highly recommend this set to anyone interested in ragtime and the music of Scott Joplin . Purchase this set as soon as possible , and if you have not done so already , pick up the Joseph Lamb and James Scott sets produced by the same team . Happy listening !
 This is it . Every known work written by Scott Joplin played by a talented pianist with crystal clear sound quality . Even better , the production values are amazing . The four discs come in two jewel cases which fit inside a cardboard box . The artwork on the cases and box is detailed and reminds me of a phonograph record sleeve . The cover art includes drawings of `` the Cascades '' at the 1904 St Louis World 's Fair in all four seasons . There are two thick booklets of liner notes in the jewel cases including a biography of Joplin , history of Ragtime , historical pictures and sheet music covers , and detailed information about every song in the collection.Some of the other reviewers have complained that Guido Nielsen is n't as expressive as their favorite pianist . Ironically , the collection 's box addresses their concerns , stating that Nielsen plays `` clear , unaffected ... allowing all of the brilliance of the original compositions to shine through , without excessive rubato or romanticism . '' Personally , I found Nielsen 's playing to be perfectly expressive and very faithful to the original sheet music . Some people can debate the tempo of Joplin 's music 'til they 're blue in the face . He warned on a few of his pieces not to play the rag too fast . How fast is too fast ? Too bad we ca n't ask him today.If you like rags and would like to experience some of the other big composers who have been overshadowed by Joplin for decades , check out Nielsen 's other collections forJoseph LambandJames Scott . For people curious about how these rags sound when played by an ensemble instead of a piano , try some of the records by the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra , likeParagon Ragtime Orchestra -LRB- finally -RRB- Plays The Entertainer .
 i saw people writing her that mr nielsen doesnt has the feeling or doesnt play as max morath ... well then i see buy the sheet music and look what is written ... mr nielsen exactly plays what is written . . except in the ragtime dance and stoptime rag where he dont use stop time ... i can hear in his playing that he is a very talented and gifted piano player who earned his 9,5 on his exam on the conservatory in Utrecht.if i listen to max morath or joshua rifkin i hear to slow music with out expression , ok mr nielsen plays some pieces to fast ... way to fast like peacherine rag . . the sheet music says `` not fast '' not `` not too fast '' or march tempo mr nielsen plays it more presto . and some more pieces are like this but overall he plays in a very good talend style.if you want to chose between nielsen , morath , arpin or rifkin ... i say nielsen .
 THE ultimate Scott Joplin performances ! Forget about the rest
 A wonderful collection of music spanning from the Baroque to the Modern and so Affordable . Each CD is in a full size jewel-case with beautiful cover art - paintings of Renaissance-era angels in muted , slightly reflective , metal-tone inks - all within a box that ties them all together . There are no liner notes in the booklet , just track listings , but the music speaks for itself . It 's not completely apparent from the track listing who the composers are , so here 's the breakdown
 This box set , along with 2 others , Passion - Most Famous Orchestral Spectaculars & Rhapsody in Blue - Ultimate Piano Collection , from the same company , have been offered at incredibly low prices -LRB- around $ 15 -RRB- and that is a value that you just can not pass up . And if the price is back to it 's normal range of about $ 50.00 I would say it is still worth it . But , I think the prices on these sets go up and down a lot , so if you can be patient , keep watching and you should be able to get it for a steal.The pieces on this collection of 20 CDs focus on the strings and the flute . Every CD has been remastered and is great quality . The list of music , as you can see , is huge , as is the number of composers . This being the case , I can highly recommend this as a PERFECT starting point for people that are new to classical ; with the other 2 box sets I listed above , this presents a varied and deep collection to begin your foray in to classical music . You can introduce yourself to a massive amount of music -LRB- over 60 hours with the 3 sets -RRB- and you can rest assured that each of these is of good quality and not just some music shop bargain bin slop.I do have some of these compositions as I have been seeking to grow my collection , but exposure to different interpretations is just as enlightening as hearing a composition for the first time . So this would be great for established classical listeners as well.And at the price of 1 CD , you just really ca n't go wrong.Buy with confidence and be prepared to be delighted . And please do look at the other 2 collections referenced above as they are also a delight and a bargain to say the least.Enjoy !
 I have not listened to this set because I purchased it for my daughter . She tells me it is very good , and she never has to think about what she is going to listen to anymore .
 This CD collection is an incredibly good bargain . The quality is superb and the selections were excellent as well . I am happy I ordered this .
 A collection of masters that insist that you relax as you listen . An exquisit addition to any music cd collection .
 Sinatra 's 1979 recording of this often-recorded , nearly-classic tune gave it a real shot in the arm and aggressivness lacking in previous versions by other artists . The song 's lyrics could have been written for Sinatra , who loved statement songs of any kind , particularly those which involved proving people wrong . Sinatra was at the perfect age to sing this song
 I grew up listening to Cami , and I still ca n't get over just how wonderful she is ! She manages to portray herself so well through her music , it 's like she 's in the same room as you ; every time I listen to By Request I can nearly see her just grinning and laughing whilst singing .
 This CD is a must have for the classical music lover . The songs are sung with such passion ! Especially the song `` Il Mio Bel Foco '' which is a brilliant piece in itself . Definetly one of the best I have heard . Anyone out there who is looking for a good classical CD has found one ! I was n't sure if I was going to like it , but after I listened to it , it is one of my all time favorites . The music is very meaningful and that is what makes good music .
 The review title says it all . Track one is excellent . The price of the album is worth it for this one track alone .
 This is not a mixed CD . These are original remixes by the famous DJ Larry Levan of the Paradise Garage . If you are a fan of `` Disco ? '' , `` House '' , `` Deep-House '' , `` Garage '' , `` Chicago-House '' or whatever you want to call it , you will appreciate this set . There are too many standouts for me to type , but me 3 favorites are Skyy - 1st Time Around , Instant Funk - Crying , Inner-Life - Make It Last Forever -LRB- became a Paradise Garage Anthem -RRB- . Note the remixes are all extended versions with plenty of instrumental and vocal emotion .
 By that I mean remixed . If you find yourself buzzin off live at Paradise Garage , you should get the same amount of satisfaction from this . Larry took Salsoul favorites and remixed them to max effect . along with Westend , Salsoul have a reputation of creating some of the hardest hittin dance music known to man . With Larr behind the boards handlin these bad boys , expect to feel like a kid who had too much sugar ! You 'll be bouncin ' off the walls and through the roof.I especially love how he bring in the precussive breaks in certain tracks such as the garage house standard `` I got my mind made up '' courtesy of Instant funk and Bunny Sigler 's `` By the way you Dance '' . If you love the latter track on his paradise Garage mix CD , you definately need to check for this version . As opposed to the 7 minute version on Paradise Garage , this version is ten minutes long . His emphasis precussive breaks and that powerful hook makes that version sound more intricate than the one on Live at Paradise Garage . But that 's a drop in the cocktial glass to other tracks on this album . First Choice is reliably soulful as always on `` Double Cross '' -LRB- the string loop at the beginning alone is worth a a double take -RRB- , Instant funk is repsrented by several other stellar remixes such as , `` Crying '' , `` Everybody '' , `` Slap Slap Lickedy Lap '' , and `` Bodyshine '' . Slap Slap is a sleazy piece about oral sex that rivals `` Nice and Naasty '' as being the sexiest track in the Salsoul catalog . Of course you get the ultimate garage anthem with Inner Life 's `` Ai n't no mountain high Enough '' amongst others.Overall this is every bit as gratifying as `` Live at Paradise Garage '' . While it does n't have the cinematic rush of that that album , Salsoul Mixes is the hardest and heaviest anthology between the two . Every disco and househead on this planet should have this collection . on the surface this may seem like another Salsoul anthology but , with Levan housin ' s & * ! , he 'll bring it down and leave us there to pick up the pieces!More than Highly reccomended !
 let me start by saying i am a massive fan so my thoughts are one sided okbut if you can lay your hands on this cd do it stand out tracks wellthey all stand out but instant funk crying bunny sigler by the way you dance & of course inner life aint no mountain high enough & sparkle handsome manif you are serious about quality dance music it doesnt get much better than this collectionits not easy or cheap to find but get it & play it for someone not aware of this music i assure you they will find something in this to move them its worked for me
 Classic Old and Gold has some really great songs on it that I have n't heard in years . My favorite on this disc is Tra La La La Suzy by Dean and Jean , a forgotten 45 that they never play on the radio . Really , check it out
 Changes is a cool song , They didnt ruin it . Maybe this single did go gold because of ozzy 's accident , but its still a great song . I am totally satisfied with this single . I love that they put a really cool remix of Changes . It 's an awesome remix . I also really like Dig Me Out -LRB- Live -RRB- . Its the best song ever.So to Kelly , hope you get well soon and ca n't wait for the new album ...
 I Love the song . I loved the old verson , but this is better . Anyone that doesnt like it has no feelings . Ozzy is a Father & I believe that this song shows the Love he has for his daughter . As well as the Love Kelly has for her Dad.Those who do n't like it , get a life . My Dad is in his final days & I am having it played at his funeral . WHY ? I Love my Dad & we have been through a lot together . Many CHANGES !!!
 It 's a great single . One Kelly will remember forever and get to always listen to later on threw the years . The single is great but I was n't impressed with the remix . Why remix a song as great as this ? The original is always the best ! Overall great song !
 I was very pleased when I received my ` Changes ` CD . It was in perfect condition and the shipping was great . Very pleased and am buying another . I only wish that I could find a DVD to watch the two Osbournes singing it . I wrote a book for my grand daughter and ` Changes ' is one of the songs I used . If anyone knows where I can get one please post it.Thanks
 Doris Day had a radio program in the early 1950s , and this is one complete show from the program , from the opening introduction to the close . -LRB- If this was not a sustaining program , they 've removed the commercials ; otherwise it sounds complete . -RRB- They have put track markers on the CD , so you can get to each song , but if you just put it on and start it , you will not hear any pauses at the track boundaries , so that they have been placed arbitrarily . -LRB- I think this is one thing that was not done right ; when she does 2 songs with a little bit of dialog between them , the track boundary is in the middle of the dialog . I would have put two track boundaries in , one at the end of one song and one at the beginning of the next . But this is a minor quibble . -RRB- The songs are almost entirely ones she has recorded either on albums or as singles -LRB- or both -RRB- -- and with fairly similar arrangements . I would have preferred that they picked a day when she might have sung some songs that were not on her records , but for all I know this might not have been possible.The most negative thing I have to say is the skimpiness of the liner notes . They are mostly a short biography of Doris Day with well known facts , while I would have wanted more information about the radio show , particularly the date of the broadcast and things such as whose orchestra was backing her . None of this was provided.Still , Doris Day 's voice is beautiful , and none of these negative comments can particularly cut the rating below a 4-star count . I 'm not sorry I bought it .
 This is a collection of some of Dion 's biggest hits for Laurie Records , with and without the Belmonts . Nine of the songs feature the Belmonts and nine do not . All the songs are from Dion 's first go-round with Laurie Records , so his Laurie Records recordings from the late - '60s , like `` Abraham , Martin and John '' , are not included . But the songs that are included are really great . I highly recommend this CD .
 Sometimes one wonders why certain classical performers become `` house singers '' and others `` stars . '' Armand Tokatyan is a perfect case in point . Strictly from the viewpoint of his voice and artistry , he was at least as good a tenor as Jussi Bjorling but did not have the Swede 's fame . Why ? My guess is because he was Armenian-American . His swarthy complexion was simply not `` marketable '' in his time as a romantic lead , even though his voice was very fluid and his tone bright and open as well as honeyed . In some ways he was very much like Bjorling , in that he sang with a clean line and lack of exaggerated Italian mannerisms in the midst of the `` verismo '' era , but in some ways he was even better . He never transposed down , for instance , which means that he hits legitimate high Cs in his `` Boheme '' excerpts whereas Bjorling only did so on records . -LRB- In person , even as far back as the '40s , Bjorling often transposed his Cs down to Bs . -RRB- In addition , Tokatyan sings with more emotional involvement than Bjorling . Does this mean that I do n't like Bjorling any more ? Not at all . There were some things he did that were simply fantastic , such as his 1939 `` Adelaide '' or his various renditions of `` Gross ist Jehova , '' the 1940 Missa Solemnis with Toscanini and the 1955 `` Aida . '' But give a listen to Tokatyan - this was one of the great voices of the last century , clean , musical , bright , open and with a warmth and sheen that you rarely hear any more . Highly recommended .
 I 've been listening to this guy for over forty years ... nobody writes a better lyric and nobody sings his songs better because they 're so personal -LRB- with the POSSIBLE exception of his fellow Canadian , Sarah McLachan 's version of `` Song for a Winter 's Night . '' -RRB- . I drove across the country with -LRB- tapes back then -RRB- `` Old Dan 's Records '' , `` Don Quixote '' and `` Sit Down Young Stranger '' and the year I lived in Canada , nearly always had `` Highway Songs '' going while crossing the border . There are great songs on all of his albums - but in the `` desert island '' scenario , the aforementioned albums/cd 's are the three I would take . If you have n't heard this , you 're in for a truly great experience . I only wish `` The Last Time I Saw Her '' was on one of these .
 `` It 's Worth Believin ' '' is in my opinion the very best of Gordon Lightfoot , hands down , and for that reason alone , this album will always be my favorite . I liked every single cut on the album , perhaps mainly because the instrumental mix has much in common with my Bluegrass bent . Gordon Lightfoot is the one singer/songwriter who has had the most dramatic impact on me personally since I discovered his music as a teenager back in the 70 's . The three albums I still love most came in a short span between 1972 and 1975 . -LRB- `` Old Dan 's Records '' , `` Don Quixote '' , and `` Cold on the Shoulder '' . As much as I liked Sundown , I liked the more `` country '' flavor of the earlier albums . Interestingly enough , I really like `` Harmony '' -LRB- 2004 -RRB- where I think he returns to those earlier roots . I have sung his songs all of my life , and I guess I 'll be singing them `` over there '' when my time here is done . I love the man and his music .
 Lightfoot favorite that was good to hear again ! He is at his prime on this album both as a singer and songwriter .
 While there are other Gordon Lightfoot albums -LRB- oops , I 'm showing my age -RRB- that I like better , I find this album enjoyable too . His voice is good , and the musicianship is equally good . There is some soft banjo in the background , which most of his albums do not have . The words to the songs are included . Even if they were not included , I can always understand every word he sings on his other albums . I just love his voice during this time period.I really like `` Farewell to Annabel , '' `` Old Dan 's Records '' -LRB- which I first heard on his great `` Gord 's Gold '' -RRB- , `` Mother of a Miner 's Child , '' and my favorite tune `` You Are What I Am . '' The latter is such an upbeat love song . I 'm glad I added this to my Gordon Lightfoot collection .
 Those listening to this album for a heavily orchestrated CAREFREE HIGHWAY-like performance are n't going to get their wish . However , if you 're a Lightfoot fan who wants to listen to powerfully emotional lyrics that seem to tell a story of a songwriter 's pain and dealings with loss -LRB- and love -RRB- , then you 'll be moved.There 's always a risk of `` turning off '' listeners when the opening song is a sad one . Indeed , FAREWELL TO ANNABEL is just that . The lyrics though are so powerfully written -LRB- along with the subtle sad tones laid down by the strings -RRB- that a good listener ca n't leave that song but feeling sorry for the story-teller -LRB- Example
 This is Gordon Lightfoot and folk music at its best.If I could only have one of Lighfoot 's albums , this would be it .
 How great it is to be able to find CDs that are no longer available elsewhere ? It 's super .
 It 's a keeper once you have all the others . Here you will find song themes of poverty , love , remorseful self reflection , as well as betrayal . `` That same old obsession '' is another work of impeccable genius with a chilling reference to evil during a lovers agony in the garden
 I do n't see anything wrong with this album . It has everything that I want from a Gordon Lightfoot album
 This is a very good album . It 's just difficult to pick up a vibe from it in my opinion . It is hypnotic and I find myself listening to it time and again . Although I ca n't get the idea out of my head that it 's an album made up of afterthoughts.Some think it 's more upbeat , I say it has more of a somber feel to it . The standouts for me are `` Farewell To Annabel '' , `` That Same Old Obsession '' and `` It 's Worth Believin ' '' . It has it 's high points , but again , to me it 's difficult to nail down a vibe .
 This may very well be my favorite Gordon Lightfoot album of them all . If you ask an average fan what their top 10 favorite Lightfoot songs are , I 'd be willing to bet none of them come from this album . There are no big hits on it
 Canadian singer/songwriter/acoustic guitarist Gordon Lightfoot was in the midst of his creative zenith when Old Dan 's Records was recorded in 1972 . So this album simply rolls from one melodic , emotional highlight to another . For me , so many of these songs echo places and times ... the piano driven ballad Same Old Obsession is like a melancholy Victorian-era drama ... Lazy Mornin ' suggests a idyllic day in the country ... and despite its title , Ca n't Depend On Love has a wonderful lightness to it . What 's interesting about this album is the history of its time ... in his book Lightfoot
 Gordon Lightfoot has long been one of my favorite singers and while not his best , `` Old Dan 's Records '' is still pretty enjoyable . To me , six of the ten songs are good , with `` It 's Worth Believin ' '' still being a favorite . That and the title song can still get your toes tappin ' and your head a ` noddin ' . `` Lazy Morning '' makes you feel just like the title says . `` You Are What I Am , '' `` Mother of A Miner 's Child '' and `` Ca n't Depend On Love '' are all GOOD , but not GREAT , songs . But with Gordon 's rich baritone and the underdone instrumental backgrounds , you 'll find yourself liking it anyway .
 In the early 70 's Gordon Lightfoot cranked out a lot of good folk based music and there are differing views on where he shines best . For me , he 's at his best here , Old Dan 's Records . While I agree it 's not easy to pick one album over another and I would n't have problems with someone who wanted to argue for another of his albums , for me this album stands out for two reasons.The first is the arrangements . Back when Lightfoot was doing his best work there was a thing for adding orchestration to his music , I suspect to make them more popular and `` commercial . '' But I 've always felt he sounds best when the strings are gone and the music focuses on his voice and the guitars , dobros , bass , and drums - his basic sound , Lightfoot with Rick Haynes , Terry Clements and Red Shea . And of all his albums , this one more than any other I know emphasizes that sound . The strings are here , but they take a back seat . You barely notice them when they appear.The other reason is that it was around this time Lightfoot 's voice was at its best . He sounds great on this disc.His songwriting is also at its peak . So ... This album more than any other captures the Gordon Lightfoot I love . It also has three of my favourite Lightfoot songs
 Gordon Lightfoot is hard to come by here in Sweden , so when I saw Old Dan 's & Dreamstreet rose in a used cd-shop I jumped at it . the `` rose '' is not nearly as good as `` Old Dan 's '' . THis does not mean that OD is outstanding in any way ! Sure , there are a few gems on here , but so are there on all gord 's cd 's . He has only himself to blame . If he persists in spoiling us , his audience , with great music , he will get no slack when he 's on the downsloap ... All of gord 's pre-80 's catalogue is more or less flawless . This record is one of the less interesting from this period , but still it 's a darn good waste of time !
 One of my favorite of Gord 's albums because he 's singing his heart even more than usual.Nothing commercial going on here ; no pop tunes , no overt attempts at a single . Instead , the best collection of lyrics Gord ever put on a single album . Each song evokes a particular mood ; just the right memories matched lyrically to just the right music.More than any other GL album , this one makes me feel like I know him .
 Of all the albums Gordon Lightfoot released between 1971 and 1976 this is the weakest . But it 's far from bad , and about half of it is outright fantastic , particularly the album bookends of ` Farewell To Annabel ' and ` Hi'Way Songs ' . The title track was the only song to be included on the ` Gord 's Gold ' compilation ; quite why it made the cut above the aforementioned tunes or ` It 's Worth Believin ' -LRB- Which , at least , was included in it 's original version on the mostly poorly remade ` Gord 's Gold II ' -RRB- is a mystery , it 's not a bad tune , but nor is it particularly memorable.The album continued Lightfoot 's early 70s downward slide commercially , failing to land a single in the hot 100 , and scraping in at # 95 on the album charts . Of course the follow-up album , ` Sundown ' , reversed this trend dramatically , and rightly so.While 4 stars is possibly a little generous for this release , especially given just how far it is beneath Lightfoot 's highwater mark for quality , I could not bring myself to limit it to 3 . Inessential , but still well worth having .
 It has probably been 25 years since I listened to this album . I could n't believe how good it sounded . I listened to it about 3 times in a row before I put it aside . Gord 's voice is at the peak of its richness here . Several songs -LRB- It 's Worth Believing , Farewell to Annabel -RRB- are absolutely haunting , they are so moving .
 I agree with the previous reviewer who states that this may very well be the best Lightfoot cut ever . In my mind , the music and instrumentation -LRB- guitar , banjo , autoharp , dobro , pedal steel -RRB- are the very soul of Gordon Lightfoot
 Do n't let inexperienced listeners fool you
 Boards of Canada 's full-length album was one I enjoyed immensely . This Peel Session is more an extension of that than anything . I liked the minor additions to Aquarius , and the Olson revamp is quite soothing , yet short . Happy Cycling is a track I had already on the album , but a great addition , no less . Perhaps the excellence of this release could have been helped by the addition of `` XYZ '' , which was also recorded for that session . If you are looking to be blown away , look elsewhere ; if you are looking for a couple new -LRB- yet familiar -RRB- tracks , this is the one for you . A definite `` A + '' for content , but a `` C '' for effort .
 I have everything B of C have done and this is one of the best . They are at their most happy-sounding , almost giddy , with the first two tracks and then a meloncholy , gorgeous third track . The tracks flow together perfectly and it 's impossible to listen to this and not feel slightly happier and in a better mood . It 's minimal - short and sweet , if they put any more on it would ruin the effect.You may not think it 's worth it , but this is a really special record.ok , this is a single with 3 tracks : - Aquarius - a different and MUCH better version then on ` Music has the Right ... ' - Happy Cycling - already on the american release of ` Music has the Right ... ' - Olsen - see Aquarius . Almost a completely different track . Extremely beautiful .
 Short , yes , but very , very re-listenable . BoC are very easy to experience again and again , and nothing 's different about this disc.Aquarius almost -LRB- almost ! -RRB- disappointed me . It seems to be reoughly the same thing -LRB- though this is to be expected from a Peel Session -RRB- having taken a step backwards and a step forwards . The added drums remove much of the ambiance of the piece , although they add their own `` crunchy '' flavor . A subtle reinterpretation of a great song , made for a different mood.Olson is , always has been , and always will be incredible . They took a simple piece and completely changed the feeling . More Geogaddi like , calming and yet unnerving at the same time . Perhaps the best `` new '' thing on the CD.Happy Cycling is the reason Olson is only the best `` new '' thing on the CD . It 's one of the best things BoC has ever made , but if you 've listened to Music has the Right , which most who buy this album will have , it wo n't seem new . It 's the same thing.XYZ , not listed on the tracklisting on Amazon for whatever reason , does n't sound like you 'd expect BoC to sound like . Very progressive , very drummy . Quite good . Worth a listen.If you like BoC at all you should grab it . It has a little bit of everything they do .
 As the title suggests , this CD consists of three session recordings for John Peel 's brilliant radio show on the BBC . The first and last tracks are fine re-mixes of those taken from the Board 's excellent first album , whereas the second track - not on the album - is a seagull-sappling , trip-fest that tickles your fancy whilst never rubbing you up the wrong way ! Get your credit cards at the ready , pop-pickers !
 I really love this release . Short , yes , but it is very VERY good , the one CD of theirs which I play the most.VERY recommended .
 This is undisputably the best John Peel session ever recorded . Words can not express the sheer beuty of ` Aqaurius ' . A sound akin to a quireboy on MDMA . Breathtakingly awesome stuff .
 I 've always been annoyed that this CD did not include `` XYZ '' which was part of the originally recorded BoC Peel Sessions.The `` Olson '' version is very cool .
 Boards of Canada are the bomb , this disc is the bomb , buy it
 Very dreamy , shoe-gazer pop reminiscient of Catherine Wheel -LRB- in fact , the lead vocals sounds very much like Rob Dickinson 's hushed vocals on `` Ferment '' 15 years prior -RRB- , only with tighter beats and more dramatic drone where appropriate . These guys are ultra-personable on-stage as well so it will come as no suprise when they 're playing live on the O.C. Season Finale -LRB- not that it would be a bad thing -RRB- .
 For Wayne Kramer , the hard stuff is n't drugs . It 's the rock 'n' roll life -- day jobs , booze , blaring amps , police sirens and struggle . Constant struggle.Kramer has been pushing since 1967 , when he and his bandmates in the MC5 sailed a spearhead of protopunk metal and righteous political anger out of Detroit and into ... absolute obscurity . Their `` spiritual adviser '' John Sinclair got sent to the slammer over two joints , the band split with their major label , singer Rob Tyner and guitarist Fred Smith died , and Kramer has done hard time . `` I 've been trying to sell out for years , '' he says , `` but nobody was buying . `` His solo debut sounds unlike anything else out there
 Great songwriting and intense musicianship . Do you think that bands like the Hives and White Stripes are original ? Why dont you listed to the original bands and musicians that influenced them ? Wayne was the guitarist of the MC5 . In this album , he hasnt lost any of the intensity in guitarmanship and the songwriting tells some great stories of his past.Highly recomended . List to Johnny Badseed . Electrifying !!
 Brother Wayne Kramer . Proto-punk guitarist . MC5 rocker that helped define modern political discourse in music . Umm , how many bands had the resolve to actually play the Democratic Convention in ' 68 ? NOBODY . The MC5 played amongst the police battalions ordered by Mayor Daly . `` Fort Daly '' was attempted to be sewn up like Singer , but the MC5 ripped it to shreds!Yup . You heard it here . Reformed street thug that served time and today gives back to prisoners with his sincere activism . You do know Brother Wayne recently kicked out the jams at friggin ' SING SING in Ossining . You tellin ' me that Cash at Folsom rocked harder?This solo record pummels you from the beginning . You know it 's Brother Wayne from the get go . His playing replicates hot rods pulling off the line when the light turns green . There 's fractured melody in there , too and thus a listener does n't feel alienated.His lyricism updates the MC5 's politics to be more inclusive of current struggles ; but the record has no shelf life ! The words still ring true.His playing is still menacing . Having worked with him on a number of occasions , his politics are sincere and his dedication to making positive impacts on today 's communities is unquestioned as evidenced with his work in Road Recovery.Wayne 's vocals may not have the soul swagger of Mc5 's Rob Tyner , but there 's honesty you feel ringing through your speakers.This record is a testament to Kramer 's soul force , resilience , and transcendence.Find another storied guitarist that plays this hard ; as if this was his first record .
 There 's not a bum note on this album . Wayne gets together with members of Bad Religion , Claw Hammer , the Melvins and others in the MC5 appreciation society to create some serious R-O-C-K . `` Crack in the Universe , '' `` Bad Seed , '' `` Pillar of Fire '' all sound like classics Kramer and Co. pull out of a hat , while `` Poison '' revisits that old panic in Detroit . There 's a junkie 's nod to Johnny Thunders , some sartorial silliness -LRB- `` Sharkskin Suit '' -RRB- , even some spoken-word drama . And the sly album packaging echoes the classy jazz look of Blue Note , with an old-school liner note appreciation by Henry Rollins . Do n't forget to turn it up !
 Mel Torme sings @ 17 years old ! WOW ! He first sang with Chico Marx and his orch . On this CD , the year is 1942 . Chico also displays incredible comic style in between songs . Desi Arnaz also has a wonderful Orchestra ! He plays great standarts like , Speak Low and many others . I highly recommend this CD . A very hard CD to find . Almost impossible to find anything my Chico Marx at all!Dirk
 The Hollywood dinner club scene of the 1940 's is well-represented with these recordings -LRB- probably done for radio -RRB- , with seven songs from the Desi Arnaz Orchestra and seven from the Chico Marx Orchestra . A delight to hear ! Chico even does one of his famous piano routines on `` Beer Barrel Polka '' ! Desi was the first to bring the Latin beat -LRB- congas -RRB- to Hollywood Big Bands -- ahead of his time with `` World Music '' ! This is a time capsule of the era , the sound , the fun .
 I actually came across this disc because I enjoy the sound of vibes , and was asking friends for the name of an artist who is known for playing the instrument . I found out that in the jazz world , where vibes are most frequently used , Bobby Hutcherson was the preeminent name . Well recorded vibes are a sinfully rich aural treat , especially on a good sound system , unfortunately the music played on them , which is often modern `` smooth jazz '' is enough to lull you to sleep . That may be OK for background music , but if you want to hear creative and energetic interplay - not to mention Bobby 's virtuosity with the instrument , I highly recommend this disc . It was made with I believe cuban musiscians , and is rich with sexy Latin rythmns . The various percussion instruments add a great variety to the sound . This is a disc I would recommend not only for it 's musical content , but also for the pure pleasure of the rich sound of the recording . Treat yourself - you wo n't be disappointed !
 B Angie B started out as a back up singer for the Bust-It label formed by MC Hammer and his brother Louis . She sang for artists including Hammer , Oaktown 's 357 , Soft Touch , One Cause One Effect , Ace Juice , and then of course her own debut cd in 1991 . Her music was infused with hip-hop r & b ; along with strong soulful vocals . Her first single to gain attention was a cover of the Emotions 70 's clasic `` I DO N'T WANT TO LOSE YOUR LOVE '' which peaked at # 2 on the billboard hot 100 . Her live performances drew all kinds of attention as in those days she was the pioneering rump shaker and I think people did n't really know where to put her as far as a music category . She was different then those other types of singers at the time . Very fresh , original , and just pure beautiful . Her sound would go on to influence many others such as Mary J. Blige , Mariah , and Beyonce just to name a few.This remastered cd was done very well and sounds beautiful . The quality is excellent . This cd also includes a bonus dvd of rare B Angie B performances and three music videos including Midnite Lover , I Do n't Want To Lose Your Love , and Sweet Thang.To this day B Angie B remains one of the most underated talents of modern r & b-hiphop ; music .
 Listen to `` I Do n't Wan na Lose Your Love '' and know why B Angie B is a DIVA !!!!!!!!
 I was just thinking about this album and looked it up on Amazon to read some reviews on it and see what similar music I might find from back in the day that I forgot about . I still have a copy of the first release from years ago when this album first came out and amazingingly enough that thing still plays . I know I must have given that cd a hard time playing it so much back in the 90 's . There are three songs on this cd that I love and that 's I DO N'T WANT TO LOSE YOUR LOVE , THIS IS A JAM FOR YOU , and PUMP IT UP . It 's too bad she only made this one cd because she really had a powerful voice .
 I am so grateful to have this album back !!!! I 've always been a `` B Angie B '' fan as well as a fan of Oaktown 357 and the entire MC Hammer crew . This was good 90 's music that I really enjoyed and now miss . Thanks again for bringing B Angie B back !
 do n't let this solo release from former squirrel nut zippers frontman fool you - this ai n't no swing record ! there 's swing on it ... but it ai n't no swing record . it 's much much more than that.delving deep into a treasure trove of styles tom maxwell has created a mature , musical excursion through a multitude of different styles that are all , in one way or another , thematically linked to the buddhist concept of samsara . maxwell 's unique ability to find the voice of song and arrange it -LRB- using an array of truly outstanding performers -RRB- is evident on this recording.while songs like ` uptown stomp ' and ` sixes and sevens ' harken back to the zippers giddy , on the edge style they add a deeper more mature element that no zippers record every explored . add to that songs like ` roll them bones ' with the tremendous remember vocal quartet , you never heard a song about the passing of a friend fill you with such hope -LRB- and booty shake ! -RRB- I ca n't say enough good things about this record and i have a feeling that it 's going to be different things to different people . one thing for sure is that Maxwell has thrown off the restrictions that pigeonholed the zippers and created one of the most honest , well crafted and musical albums of the last decade .
 This CD is great !! Obviously Tom is willing to put himself out on a limb musically , which is refreshing these days , and let his audience see a true bit of his soul . I think he deserves a lot of credit for putting out a honest and well crafted work . If this is his first effort as a solo artist I think that he has a amazing career ahead of him . Listen to this CD without any preconceptions , it is a classic .
 Simply Wonderful - style by style , lyric by lyric , haiku/poetry with a romping fun beat . The title track alone is worth the price of admission to this spectactular of audio joy ! Tom - do n't worry - be happy ! Sam sara ...
 Tom Maxwell is clearly a fearless , and therefore rare , artist . He has cut himself loose from the confines that record labels impose to instead follow his heart and make an album representative of all that has influenced and moved him in his life . Samsara offers a wide array of musical styles but manages to somehow be incredibly cohesive . Tom is the link that holds each song to the next . He is a master at arranging songs , and choosing strong and versatile performers to carry out his vision . His voice is distinctive and warm . The covers on this album are wonderful , but the originals are what really pull in the listener - each one attaching itself with a unique magnetism that only grows deeper on its second , third , and fourth listen .
 I want to keep this short . I bought SNZ 's Bedlam Ballroom not knowing there were changes in the group , when I discovered the missing element was Tom Maxwell I bought this cd as well . This is the one I still listen to a year later . PLEASE GIVE US MORE TOM !
 I 've never had a strict allegiance to any particular musical styles , and the most likely answer you 'll get as to what kind of music I like is `` Good ! '' . Samsara is one of those albums that may require it 's own category ... but one genre it definately falls in for me is GOOD ! It 's probably the most addictive album yet , especially for an amateur eclectic wannabe musician such as myself . It has a dizzying array of styles , almost every song is a kick in the pants and flies in the face of the old saw about `` there 's no good ` new ' music '' . This album features Tom Maxwell and Ken Mosher , late of SNZ , two other current SNZ members and the awesome Duke Heitger on trumpet , Julius McKee -LRB- Dirty Dozen -RRB- on Sousaphone , and much more . Holly Harding-Baddour adds a rich vocal on `` If I Had You '' , a song of simple beauty and timeless sentiment . `` Uptown Stomp '' is probably my favorite song in the world right now and I still ca n't get enough of it . Samsara will bend your ears many different ways , from classic cry-in-your-beer country to delta blues to Dixieland to Gospel to the utterly indescribable `` Caveat Emptor '' . There 's even a spooky pipe organ number and an adaptation of the traditional Chinese . Bring an open mind , open ears , a sense of humor , and prepare to be hooked .
 Samsara under the ledearship of previous band member Tom Maxwell of the group Squirrel Nut Zippers has lots of elements that one can expect from genres of jazz such as New Orleans Jazz and Classical Jazz . According to my openion this CD can even beat any SNZ album . I like SNZ very much and thanks to SNZ as I have had come to know Tom Maxwell and other gifted musician of today like Andrew Bird , Katharine Whalen , Kevin O'Donnel when I have collected my first SNZ CD a few years back.This CD has also introduced to me the melodious voice of Holly Harding Baddour . The pieces `` If You Had Me '' and `` Samsara '' shows that she is equally competent to any female jazz vocalist . Tom Maxwell is a musical genious and there is no doubt about that . He can play not only lots of instruments , but also can sing with sheer confidence . His vocal in The `` Uptown Stomp '' , `` Do n't Give Me Runaround '' , `` No Body Likes Me '' just proves that . His solo gitar `` Three Fires Blues '' is one of the best solo gitar blues that I have heard . This CD is for mature music lover , but it can also be a great introduction for novice who wants to taste the great jazz music of the old days . This CD is extreamly diverse . `` Flame in My Heart '' sounds like country music and `` Some Born Singing '' by Holly Harding Baddour reminds me as if I am listining to Radio Peking . It is very Chinise indeed.I thank every musician who has contributed to this album , especially my coardial thanks again goes to the producer of this CD Mr. Mike Napolitano who previously produced som of the most brilliant albums that I have ever listened and he is still keeping that promise . As a jazz enthusiast , I consider this CD to be a gem in my collection . If I had the oppertunity , than I could give this CD six stars . Buy this CD NOW and I promise you will never regret for that . -LRB- Buy also CDs of the gifted musician Andrew Bird , Kevin O'Donnels , Tom Maxwell , Tom Jimbo Mathus , Katharine Whalen and of the group Squirrel Nut Zippers , Andrew Bird 's Bowl of Fire , Kevin O'Donnels Quality Six and other musicians whose name appears on the cover of their CDs . These musicians use to colaborate with each other . -RRB-
 ` Samsara ' is a sampler from the mastermind behind such Squirrel Nut Zippers tunes as `` Hell '' , `` Put a Lid on It '' , `` Trou Macque '' and many others.The beauty of Chinese opera , hot stompin ` jazz , and spooky pipe organ have been meshed together in such a fashion as to create one of the most experimental albums of the year . The honesty behind this album is incredibly humbling and worthy of intense praise . The title track alone wins my favor.If youre into haunting moods and cartoon-like jest check out Squirrel Nut Zipper 's session violinist Andrew Bird 's Bowl of Fire , as well .
 I bought this album last fall and loved it , but wanted to wait a while before posting a review . Hsving listened to it countless times since then ... I truly believe this is a masterpiece . The previous reviews are right on the money about how imaginatively eclectic the mix of styles is , and Tom Maxwell does a superb job of fitting the various pieces together into a unified musical statement . It 's hard to conceive of an album where , for instance , the deep baritone voices of the Remember When soul singers and the playful high cabaret-style female voices sound at home together , but he makes it work here . Taken as a whole , the CD has a richness reminiscent of an extremely good soundtrack album , like a soundtrack to the best David Lynch or Coen Brothers movie never made . I wholeheartedly look forward to Tom 's next release .
 Leaving to do his own thing I think opened him up in some way to make music I wish folks still made more of . I have friends that find there own favorite songs , but feeling satisfied with a lot of lot . First , there was never any sousaphone playing on any Zippers album that I remember , which was a beautiful old , classic touch . Then , you wish you had a lot more time to find all these influences that come out in his music -LRB- like Waller -RRB- . His blues and country song are genuine , his addition of amazing Holly Harding is tremendous , the singing quartet does two completely original songs great and he seems to have a way that critics never seem smart or educated enough to come off intelligently in their `` reviews . '' If you just love music , this is the album . You can hear his missing presence -LRB- and Ken Mosher 's -RRB- in the new Zippers and you can see its soul re-figuring itself and rebirthing here with Maxwell 's visionary and roots respecting music . If I had more room I 'd say more -LRB- like you could n't tell -RRB- . Amen to him and what he does .

 Seriously . If you are looking at this page of Amazon it would be hard to believe you are unaware of SNZ , and being aware of such , as unfortunately esoteric as that may be , your surely asking yourself , `` Is this solo effort on par with the aforementioned sonic greatness ? '' . Indeed it is . Buy it .

 My company is currently working on producing `` Animal Crossing
 I am a big fan of the music by Tota K.K from the Animal Crossing series . I expected to get all of KK 's songs , but only got a handful . Turns out , this was a soundtrack to the movie Animal Crossing . It is not a bad product if you are the fan of the movie , I was only bummed because it did not have the songs I expect it to have !
 This CD has music form the game . Well , form Wild World . It has the moring songs , some KK Slider songs , and others form the game . there are 51 tracks on it . It is a MUST HAVE for any Animal Crossing fans .
 Grandiose , excellent electronic music . Very different to Schulzes earlier works on space music -LRB- Irrlicht , Timewind , Body Love -RRB- . This work is more straightforward , transparent and clear . It is MODERN electronic music.Some parts are insightfull , tranquile , ambient landscapes while others are powerfull , superb rythmical pieces of mature electronic music . Part I is a magnificent entry to this work . You have to listen to this , I reassure you that you will not be dissapointed . Part II is one of the best electronic music I have ever heard . So controlled , so melodic , so well planned . It is excellent . The beat is well mastered and mixes well with the music and the various effects and choir . It is absolutely perfect . Nostalgic and sublime . Part III is an 18 minutes long ambient landscape . Very Relaxing and very tranquile . In Part IV beat starts again with a mysterious synth-driven melody reminiscent of Kraftwerk . It reaches the point of being epic . Excellent piece.Part V goes slow again for 3 minutes and Part VI , oh man ... Part VI is the music of the Gods . An evocative synthesizer is praying for its electronic soul to the spirits of the universe . Very well thought music , at the right proportions . Space music at its best . Higly recommended to all serious listeners.I was surprised by the previous review . The fellow reviewer argues that he felt bad and depressed listening to this music . I guess that he does not have a background in electronic music . If this music made him feel bad then Timewind could be suicidal for him . Stay away my friend from these dangerous paths ... See also my other reviews on Klaus Schulze albums . Timewind , Irrlicht and X are on the top of my list .
 This is an outstanding CD . The first track is wonderful , vintage synthesizer sounds with a slightly modernized ` edge ' to it . The disc has many slow , ambient , smooth moments , and others which are slightly unsettling.Unfortunately , though the disc is great in most respects , it has one slight flaw ! The second track , though posessing a definitive ` electronica ' sound , has an edgy , forced sound which takes away from it . The drums could be better , in my opinion . As they are , it sounds a bit stiff , and mechanical -- whereas the rest of the CD tends to have a smoother , more natural flow . Track 2 definately sticks out like a sore thumb in the CD.That aside , track 2 does INVOLVE the listener in an emotional rollercoaster ride , with the rest of the CD , giving an outstanding sense of getting ` into ' the music . Also , volume 7 's ending track is outstanding , hair-raising ambience which borders on what heartbreak and melancholy would sound like , were it music ! Definately the best ending in the series that I 've heard , so far . No anticlimax , no fade-to-black feel , just ... stunning , jaw-dropping music until it 's OVER . Period.Another of my absolute , all time musical favorites . If I had more than two thumbs , they 'd be up too .
 This is everything electronic music is about ! 3 masters of their craft all doing what they do best . Nothing I can say in this review will give it justice , you need to download/buy/whatever it NOW !
 Musicians are a sneaky lot . Their most subtle work takes root in the crevices of your consciousness . When you least expect it , their songs starts playing in your head , driving you crazy while you try to occupy your mind with something else.The music on Ben Swift 's new solo album Pull has driven me to distraction lately . Whether I 'm eating dinner at some hole-in-the wall Mexican joint , or re-reading Nicholas Nickelby on the bus , Swift 's beautifully crafted songs play in a loop in my head.Swift earned his musical chops as a solo vocals/guitar act opening for national touring acts Phish and Crash test Dummies in the mid-nineties , and went on to receive a modicum of fame for his efforts in the Ben Swift Band , which featured jazz sideman Dan Fox running his trombone through an effects processor coming up with some ingenious sounds . This collaboration led to two solid experimental rock albums recorded in the late nineties , Cud and Chimpanzee . Swift has opted for solo again on Pull , and includes the backup work of onetime B.B. King Drummer Billy Ward and bassist Mike Visceglia , who worked as musical director for Suzanne Vega and Dar Williams . Swift spins some very adroit songwriting here ; wry commentaries on life ala Robyn Hitchcock , and some deep personal observations which contain some marvelous visuals . Swift 's songs are like photos in bottom drawers which convey equal doses of life affirming clarity and sardonic amusement.Swift plays an array of stringed instruments with exceptional ability on Pull , including mandolin , Gitorgan , and National Steel . Bassist Visceglia lays down a brooding , rhythmic foundation upon which Swift and drummer Ward construct ample melodies supporting Swift 's beguiling lyrics . As a singer , Swift sounds a tad like Tom Petty without the Southern twang and unlike Petty modulates his voice to emphasize some of the more brutal ironies in his songs.As captivating as Pull is , it may not resonate well with people looking for a quick mind-numbing experience . Several listens are a requirement to fully enjoy the slow , funky , folk rock that makes up the album , and that 's part of this record 's charm . With each listen , Swift puts his hooks in you , pulling you into his world and never letting you go about your life without hearing an instrumental bridge here and a particularly sharp line there.Swift is a very sneaky guy . In a way , he should be condemned for leaving this indelible imprint of his art on my brain . Instead , I praise him for his mastery of cynicism and the extremely incisive wit on Pull .
 This CD is a wondeful combination of well-known Turkish -LRB- and one Arabic -RRB- dace classics from energetic karsilama to more pieceful but as beautiful tsiftetellis etc. . Lively , well-made recording , acoustic instruments and rhythms that really call for dancing ! Fantastic !
 2CD reissue of two albums by California psychedelic loner whose original name may have been Craig Smith . Acid leads , mystical vocals , tons of effects , completely stoned feeling . Came out as 2 single albums and even more limited as a double album -LRB- only two copies known to exist -RRB- . The music is outer space psychedelic with great melodic songs and beautiful vocals . A real killer from beginning to end .
 I 've been after the vinyl for these two albums for 10 + years ... it is considered the holy grail of west coast -LRB- USA -RRB- psychedelia . I gave up and bought the CDs through Amazon . Better than I thought . An absolute classic and equal to the reputation . Years ahead of its time but yet perfect for the summer of love generation . Everyone I have played it to are equally high in praise .
 While I personally discount the rumor that this record was recorded not by `` Craig Smith '' but one George W. Bush during his acid/coke pagan stage these two discs give one plenty of room to project . A delightful mix of Buffalo Springfield like folk pop and a darker more morose Bread , not to mention the weird cut ups and studio nankering between songs . For those of you who wish you were old enough not to remember the sixties this is a good way to start .

 This is one of the `` final four '' - the four albums recorded by Lightfoot which had not , until now , been released on CD by Warner Brothers . -LRB- This has been released with Old Dan 's Records , which is also very good . -RRB- I had Dream Street Rose on vinyl and so listening to it once again , this time on CD , is like seeing an old friend for the first time in a long time.It 's typical Lightfoot , with his usual blend of simple melodies , lyrics about bittersweet love and , refreshingly , a brilliant version of the Auctioneer - all sung in his wonderful baritone voice . He 's on good form , as are his usual backing musicians - Terry Clements , Rick Haynes and Pee Wee Charles.If you like Lightfoot , go buy this and the other members of the `` final four '' - well worth the money . Incidentally , if you 're in the UK , they have not been released yet - am I the only UK resident with these on CD ... ?
 I love Gord.The first time I heard him , back in ' 68 , my college roommate was going crazy over this `` new guy from Canada . '' She insisted I listen.So I did , and my first reaction was `` Oh , man ... country stuff . `` I had never really been exposed to very much folk music -LRB- which I found out later was what Gord was singing . -RRB- Anyway . . after I listened a bit , I fell madly in love with him , and have been ever since.I have all of his albums on vinyl , of course , and am so happy that more and more of his work is coming out on CD . I know I have n't said anything much about this CD in particular , but if you are a Gord fan , you will buy it anyway.If you only know him from `` Sundown , '' then give this one a try.My favorite is `` Whisper My Name . '' Very few songwriters can get to your heart like Gord.Check it out.All these years later , I 'm still crazy for the guys work .
 A tossup between this and Gordon 's `` Endless Wire '' as to which is his best CD . Unfortunately , this album 's poor sales ended Gordon days of receving any meaningful radio play . By 1980 only soft rock stations played Gordon 's songs and `` Dream Street Rose '' was his last single that received hardly any air time -LRB- John Denver 's career similarly floundered in the 78-80 timeframe but he enjoyed moderate later success on country charts -RRB- . Gordon should have invested the time he spent learning yodeling for the song on this album -LRB- `` The Auctioneer '' -RRB- into branching out beyond his folk roots . I remember him in a 1981 concert mentioning he was starring in a western movie , never heard anymore about it . As revealed in his year 2000 Reno concert that is on DVD , his voice is pretty much gone amd more than one newspaper reviewer of his concerts have mentioned his heavy drinking . `` On the High Seas '' and `` If You Need Me '' are terrific songs that deserved a much better fate . So good to finally have this album on CD , the best thing about it is one can put it on and listen to every song , they are that good . Thank you , Gordon !
 Dream Street Rose had the notoriety of being one of four album releases by Gordon Lightfoot that had yet to see the light of being on CD until now -LRB- the other three being Old Dan 's Records , which has been released concurrently with this one , Shadows , and Salute -- the latter two will be released on CD later this summer -RRB- . This release also had the distinction of being one of the first digitally-recorded albums when it came out in 1980 . Turning away from the heavy-handed production techniques of Endless Wire -LRB- this album 's predecessor -RRB- , Dream Street Rose sounded terrific on LP , and sounds even better now . Rhino has done its usual wonderful job of packaging ; and the re-mastering by Bill Inglot , who did the remastering for the 4-CD set Songbook and the recently released 1-CD compilation Complete Greatest Hits , is fantastic . Makes me wish we could put ALL of Lightfoot 's releases in Inglot 's hands and say `` Here -- get to work ! `` On Dream Street Rose , Lightfoot once again utilizes his road-tested band of Terry Clements on lead acoustic and electric guitars , Rick Haynes on bass , Pee Wee Charles on pedal steel and Barry Keane on drums . They are augmented by other players , most notably Bob Glaub on bass , Michael Omartian on keyboards , and the great Lenny Castro on percussion -LRB- who would return on 1986 's East of Midnight -RRB- . Eschewing the overwhelming string arrangements on Endless Wire , Dream Street Rose benefits immensely from the light , tasteful touch of Nick DeCaro , who had done the string arrangements for many of Lightfoot 's outstanding releases in the 70s . Like many of Lightfoot 's releases from 1978 on , Dream Street Rose suffers a little from some inconsistency and a lack of drive , but it 's less noticeable on this album . The opening track , `` Sea of Tranquility '' sounds better than it ever has . For those of us who did n't really know what `` digital recording '' meant when we bought this album back in 1980 and jumped out of our chairs when the bass and drums came thundering in , get ready to jump again when you play this CD . It has never sounded so good . `` Sea ... '' contains some of Lightfoot 's best word imagery -- lyrics that feel more like they 're cascading around you than being sung to you . `` Ghosts of Cape Horn '' is a Lightfoot gem , and the clarity of the CD makes this evocative sea-chantey come alive even more . Most writers do n't like having to write something `` to order '' but it never seems to bother Lightfoot
 I have been a Lightfoot fan for decades . I find his music rich , lyrically appealing/entertaining . I tend to be drawn more to his mid period than his earlier or later stuff . Ol Dans Records is certainly one of my favorites BUT this I believe is my favorite of all my Gordon Lightfood records . I like the nautical theme and his haunting lyrics and vocally he was at his prime . Musky , masculine and down home , that is how I describe his music . A true form of the description minstrel , a great storyteller . I am so glad this is on CD now .
 Released in March of 1980 , DREAM STREET ROSE had all the makings of a classic Lightfoot recording . Every track shines on its ' own . The opening track `` Sea of Tranquility '' is mesmerizing with its ' blend of steel , electric guitar and keyboards . This should have been the first single from the album . `` Sea . . '' is definately one of the highlights as is the title track , `` On the High Seas '' , `` Whisper My Name '' and `` If You Need Me '' . This is definately the BEST record that Lightfoot has created .
 Released in '80 ` Dream Stree Rose ' was Gordon 's fourteenth album . I happened to be dating seriously at the time of its release and thought this girl might be the one , so I put her to the test . I gave her a copy of this album along with one of his early releases ; ` Back Here On Earth . ' I told her `` You 'd better learn to love this music if you want to keep dating me '' -LRB- stupid , but absolutely true -RRB- . She loved it and we will be celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary this coming August . Ahh ... the power of a true poet . Thanks Gordon ! ` Dream Street Rose ' contains -10 tracks - of solid Lightfoot compositions , my favorites are ; ` Ghosts Of Cape Horn ' , ` Whisper My Name ' and ` If You Need Me . '
 I have loved this album ever since I was 12 years old -LRB- 37 now -RRB- . It has a very solid classic Gordon Lightfoot style and yet I feel it is showcases some of the best lyrics that Gordon ever put to paper . The album is a bit less rocky than it 's predecessor `` Salute '' ... . It carries a bit more of a folky tone , with a dash of Steel Guitar , played awesomely by Pee Wee Charles ... very laid back and smooth . It is a great CD to just sit back and watch the leaves fall from the trees on an autumn day . Gordon fans from Michigan , Ontario , or Quebec will feel right at home with this CD , I recommend track 4 `` On the High Seas '' . Salut Mes Amis
 My mom & dad have raised me on Mr. Lightfoot 's music as well as folk and classic rock stuff ! I know his stuff as well anything I have from today 's stars . We can tell you that his last well received album was Shadows , not Dream Street Rose ! My Dad told me that `` Baby Step Back '' hit # 50 on Billboard 's Hot 100 chart back in 1982 . I have listened to both back to back on our CD player and they are both about equal . To all of the people shopping out there , get them both and get all of Gordon Lightfoot 's work ! It 's worth your money . Bye-Bye !
 The album before this one had Gord lean too far into country . However DREAM STREET ROSE , although heavily influenced by country , pulls off a wonderful balance of passionate lyrics , great orchestration , and a well timbered voice . To the devout Lightfoot fan , I ask if they can find a better string of 5 consecutive songs in an album than the title track followed by ON THE HIGH SEAS , WHISPER MY NAME , IF YOU NEED ME , and HEY YOU.WHISPER MY NAME and IF YOU NEED ME have got to be 2 of the finest love songs written ; and not just by Lightfoot . This album is a great buy for the Lightfoot fan who wants to add to his library , or the listener who 's never heard much outside of SUNDOWN , WRECK OF THE EDMUND FITZGERALD , and CAREFREE HIGHWAY .
 This album was released in 1980 and was available on vinyl and cassette until CD 's took over about ten years later . Since then you simply could n't get this album ! How frustrating ! Because it is quite simply a fine Gordon Lightfoot album . I , in fact , had to buy a record player a few years ago just to be able to hear my LP again . I do n't understand why Gordon 's albums of the early 1980 's , this one included , are often written off as somehow inferior . I do n't like every song on `` Dream Street Rose '' , but the first six songs I like very , very much . `` On The High Seas '' , for example , is a song nobody knows , but I am very much moved by the sadness in both the lyrics and musical arrangement . You can probably tell that I am no professional music critic , but I know what I like . Gordon 's rich voice and beautiful melodies make this purchase an essential one . Now , if they can only get to work on releasing `` Shadows '' on CD ...
 I 've always liked this release for the following tracks
 This is probably the last stunning piece of work by Lightfoot . His voice is strong , the lyrics are visual , the band is crisp , and not heavily produced -LRB- His EAST OF MIDNIGHT album suffers the fate of over-production ... Maybe SALUTE too -RRB- , and he makes emotions of happiness , sadness , adventure and appreciation of beauty pour right from your soul.Gord lays down 5 straight stunning songs on this album . From the title track , -LRB- which pulls off leaning heavily towards country , while not sounding hackneyed -RRB- , he leads you to one of his most beautiful , but sad songs written , ON THE HIGH SEAS . The song has good lyrics , with minor production overlays . Then he pens you through WHISPER MY NAME as he turns romantic without going `` overboard '' . It 's truly a masculine , romantic song . As you come off that gem , Gord lays down IF YOU NEED ME -LRB- Which is my favorite on the track ... Hmmmm DREAM STREET ROSE might be ... It 's a toss up ! -RRB- . HEY YOU wraps up a string of 5 songs . It 's a bit of a happy , fun tune , but it 's got one of his greatest lyrics tied into it '' ... reality brings mystery and ne'er the twain shall meet ... `` Outside of SUNDOWN , this is probably Lightfoot 's finest work . Anyone with even a scant interest in folk music will be pleased with this purchase .
 Having complied 20 or more Lightfoot LPs , I was glad when I could switch to COMPACT discs . But it took FOREVER for this , my favorite , to come out on CD . It finally did and now I can sit back and enjoy the entire experience .
 Gordon did n't have a ` good experience ' while recording this one ... yet , it 's classic Lightfoot ... Dream Street should have been one of his biggest sellers .
 As much as I enjoyed Summertime dream and Endless Wire , I felt those two albums lacked cohesiveness . Dream Street Rose has a great flow of songs . First time i heard this album , I KNEW this was gon na be great . Sea of Tranquilty , Dream Street Rose , On the High Seas . and Whisper my name became instant classics for me . Other great songs are If you need me , and Make way for the lady . I feel Gordon Lightfoot hit his stride and reclaimed some fire back in his songwriting.This album clicks .
 Easily Gord 's best album ever . Every song a classic . He does The Autioneer even better than Leroy Van Dyke 's original .
 There has not been a singing poet of this Stature since David wrote his psalms . Would that all men had this facility of self expression . `` Shake hands with the Father , the Son and the Holy Ghost , the impossible believer . and the heavenly host If you must do it better you just got to do it the most . Make way for the lady . You can do it my son . `` This seems to be a song about the Virgin Mary . Heady stuff actually .
 I 've been waiting for this one to come out on compact disc since I bought my first cd player . It is not that this is Lightfoot 's best album - eight of the ten tunes are only good to mediocre . But the title track and `` If You Need Me '' are two of Lightfoot 's best . I 've been hanging on to a record player just to be able to hear `` If You Need Me . '' Now , thankfully , I can send the record player down the garbage chute .
 And I thought `` Live At Montreux '' had no competition ! This set from December of 1986 , recorded 13 years after Montreux , is simply amazing . Great selection of standards plus one of Hutcherson 's own , the closing `` I Wan na Stand Over There '' . The band is a real class act . Kenny Barron is a great pianist in his own right , and makes a wonderful counterpoint to Hutcherson on all tracks . Buster Williams grounds every song wonderfully in his thick yet thoughtful bass notes , and Al Foster -LRB- who always played amazingly on Miles Davis ' last segment of records as well as on a number of Joe Henderson 's later records -RRB- does a fine job of creating the necessary driving exuberance needed on the upbeat tracks and the soft touches required on the more mellow tunes . `` Little Niles '' is a great opener ; gets the recording off on a bouncy , melodic note . Hutcherson 's take on Thelonious Monk 's `` Well , You Need n't '' is fabulous.A quick note about the recording -- not sure of what technical modifications were made , but the entire album REALLY sounds like it is happening LIVE in your own living room -LRB- or car -RRB- . Many live albums sound far away and just like , well , an album . But it is probably here where I would say this recording surpasses the Montreux recording , in terms of having that live feel . Of course , Montreux is a concert hall and the Vanguard is a small club , but still , it makes a difference . `` Some Day My Prince Will Come '' gets a wonderful take , and even though I thought I might find myself yawning on `` Witchcraft '' , I was pleasantly surprised at their version -- upbeat & you find yourself humming along with it about 30 seconds into it.A fabulous live set and a truly classic Hutcherson album . If you have any inclination to buy a Hutcherson record , you definitely can not go wrong with this one . Kudos to 32Jazz for re-releasing this out-of-print masterpiece . Highly recommended .
 Bobby Hutcherson started his career in the late 1960s as a card-carrying member of the Blue Note avante-garde club , playing -LRB- then -RRB- cutting edge sessions with Tony Williams , Jackie McLean , and Andrew Hill as well as his own sessions . As time passed , he rejoined the mainstream . Renowned producer and executive Orrin Keepnews grabbed him for his Landmark label during the 1980s , where Mr. Hutcherson was presented in various formats with outstanding bands.For this session , the eminent Kenny Barron joins Mr. Hutcherson in an outstanding live session at New York 's most famous club . Hutcherson and producer Keepnews focused on the great rapport of this group , selecting compositions which encouraged the resulting group dynamics.The opening track `` Little Niles '' burns from the first note , with Bobby and Mr. Barron swinging hard , propelled by drummer Al Foster 's sure groove . There 's no let-up in quality or group dynamics the rest of the way . The engineering is so real that you 'd swear you were there.Out of my 1000 + collection of jazz sessions , this is top 5 % .
 An outright crime that this title is not available . We need a 20-bit mastering for the master himself living on the northern california coast .
 I really miss Cannonball . This CD blows away some of my blues , because some of these tunes are very close to the power of the Nat-Cannonball music of the early sixties . Especially the Cleanhead Vinson number , `` Arriving Soon '' , which was on Cannonball-Cleanhead record . Herring , the sax player , does a great job at re-interpreting this , at times it sounds like Cannonball had returned to update his original -LRB- or was it Vinson ? -RRB- thoughts . This CD is worth buying because the good numbers are great , and the more medium tunes are still pleasant , with well thought out solos.I agree with the above review , also , with an exception concerning Zawinul
 From the opening lyrics of the first song on -LRB- `` The Hard Way , '' lyrics by Laine -RRB- , this cd had me hooked
 Two of Frankie Laine 's great albums with Johnny Williams are reissued on one disc - to excellent effect ! Although the arrangements and style of these 60s albums resemble Laine 's and William 's work on `` Hell Bent for Leather , '' in this case the songs are not cowboy songs , but , in the case of `` Dueces Wild , '' gambling songs , and , in the case of `` The Call of the Wild , '' klondike-adventure songs . No popular singer has ever explored this rough and ready terrain with Frankie Laine 's success , and it 's a thrill to hear him charge through such masculine songs as `` Call of the Wild '' and `` Roving Gambler . '' Even songs that had proved major hits for other artists are remade in Laine 's image
 rouse has been called the unsung hero -LRB- columbia LP/CD -RRB- . well its time to sing his praises !!! this CD is a gem . to hear monk tunes improvised on successfully , is an amazing accomplishment . the music
 This is a wonderful concert featuring Charlie Rouse , Monk 's main sax player for many years , with added poignance because Charlie died of cancer not long afterward . All the performances are excellent , a great concert altogether . This is absolutely first-rate jazz .
 now i have to admit right off that my only experience with HRC prior to this cd was seeing them live before i knew any of their music and then later on listening to `` if its cool with you ... '' . and when i saw them live i thought they were pretty generic and boring ... having said that ... i 've decided to check out this cd and i think its great ! i ca n't stop listening to it . the songs seem to flow well together . i feel like its not that often anymore that you can get this kind of music without the whole kid appeal of trying to fit some kind of image . this cd is definately better than `` if its cool with you . . `` the cd starts out stong right away with `` stateside '' and ends with an awesome country-ish sing-song thats bound to get stuck in your head.i highly recommend this cd .
 I have to sit back and give Hot Rod Circuit a significant applause . Through the last decade , HRC has developed this signature sound , which can and should be finally rewarded to them with this latest release , The Underground is a Dying Breed.I have adored this band for years now , and I can say with confidence that the majority of the fans found their earlier work superior , if only by a litte . This is not as much a fault as I make it out to be , but Sorry About Tomorrow and Reality 's Coming Through , albeit good albums , did not excel their first two releases.With that said , this latest release is , in essence , a return to the roots . But it excels even that , standing as one of the band 's superior releases . i could go into detai , about each individual track , and how they each stand their own ground as some of Hot Rod Circuit 's best work , but I will allow the listener to trust that this is some great material by the band , considering their entire discography.A lot of the songs sound similar , as a fault of many records in recetn years , but considering how great of a sound the band creates , I do not fault them.The guitar work is respectable in itself -LRB- as always -RRB- , and the band has really thought outside the box , while keeping their signature style intact , and have created an album that should shine as one of best alternative rock albums of the last few years.Here 's to hoping the band can dig themselves out of this dying breed , and pull out a future record worthy of the majority .
 I had just about given up on HRC -LRB- despite being very good friends with Casey Prestwood , and having shot the cover to the band 's third album -RRB- ... but having been released from the suffocating grip of Vagrant , they have put out a CD that capitalizes on the promise of their first two efforts.Andy proves himself an excellent producer , and together with a new label , the band finally tries something different -LRB- not a possibility with Vagrant -RRB- . The results are refreshing , especially for Casey , one of the great guitarists playing today . -LRB- Name an emo band that has n't stolen his riffs ! -RRB- From the violin on Vampire , to the pop sensibilities of US Royalty , to Casey 's slide guitar on the bonus track , this is not your whining little emo sister 's HRC , and that 's a good thing . In fact , with the exception of a few tracks , emo is hardly an appropriate tag . -LRB- A GREAT thing ! -RRB- This is a great rock album , with a number of tunes that will stand the test of time . -LRB- Ventricle is one of the band 's best songs ever . -RRB- To put it simply
 I am not a big fan of soundtracks but as Nick Cave is involved , I thought to give this CD a shot . Having never seen the film , I am not quite sure of its setting but it seems like it may be the Federal Penitentiary at Marion , Illinois.If you buy this , listen closely to the story as told by a former prison guard . It is a story of fear , manipulation , corruption and murder behind the walls of the big joint . It is a story that is probably familiar in some way to those who work in corrections , especially to the ordinary guards who are the foot soldiers of the penal system . And it is a story which should be known to the public at large.Interspersed with the graphic narrations of fear , brutality and betrayal , the listener will find a suitably spine-tingling score expertly composed by Nick Cave . The story merits your close attention . Both the narration and the music will have you perched on the edge of your seat . Listen carefully and you will hear that Cave seems to borrow a little from the king of soundtracks , Ennio Morricone . Only one silly little ditty for which Blixa Bargeld may presumably be held responsible breaks the spell and allows for a spot of comic relief.If you are into the work of Nick Cave or merely enjoy avant-garde sound projects , then you will probably enjoy Ghosts of the Civil Dead . Both the narration and the music drip with all the horror and suspense we have come to expect from Cave over the years . This soundtrack is rather obscure , so if you have any interest in it at all , the time to buy is now while it is yet in print .
 George , Jeff , and Mick are the lifeguards and Don is the drowning victim . Don comes out with all the intensity that i have going to the dentist , but he is rescued by The Band !!! Don picks it up alittle as it goes on , but George and the band comes ... and stays AWSOME !! The video and sound are average , but this is a must have for the Dokken fan whos a true fan of the Dokken sound . I recommend getting this DVD .

 If you want to here where glassjaw got their sound from just listen to Stillsuit . Look them up here an Amazon . THESE guys were such an amazing band that only put out an EP and 1 full length CD and its a shame they dont get any credit , especially since glassjaw seems to sound ALOT like stillsuite did . The bass player from stillsuit was even in the original glassjaw lineup . If you like glassjaw , listen to any of the two stillsuite releases and decide for yourself .
 Though toned down a bit since their last album Glassjaw has come out with an album that puts every other emo/hardcore band to shame . Using a more disconnected touch to his lyrics and greatly limiting relationship oriented songs which completly filled their first album `` Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Silence '' , Daryl seems to use less personal words but instead uses metaphores to show his feelings much like Chino from the Deftones.As a whole the band has all progressed even though some members have changed since the last album . The guitars seem to be cut back a bit more then on the first album and the band seems to be led even more now by Daryl 's fantastic and original vocals , while the bass playing steps up as well as the drumming.Stand out songs on this album are `` Stuck Pig '' and `` Pink Roses '' which shows that they still have all the aggression that was harbored on the first album , while songs like `` Must 've Run All Day '' and `` Ape Dos Mil '' show a more toned down but still haunting and dark atmospheric level.As a whole this album is a great showing from a band that will still continue to evolve and make great albums and puts them in the lead of the emo/hardcore mess that is out there today . They are sure to be one of the few bands that stays on the radar after the rest of the hype and talk that seems to surround these types of bands nowadays dies out .
 I had been looking forward to this release for a few months , but nothing could have ever prepared me for what this CD contains . Glassjaw has far exceeded my expectations on their sophomore effort . It picks up right where EYEWTKAS left off . W & T is packed full of heartfelt emotional lyrics , driving guitars , and an aggressive rhythm section . Some parts are a little more mellowed out than their debut , but it also has a definite hard edge to it . Daryl Palumbo 's vocals have an amazing range that go from all-out screaming to one of the most sensual voices in music today . The basslines are much more complex than those on EYEWTKAS . Drumming is extraordinary as always . The guitars are a little more spacy and choppy than before , but are still very impressive . I would have to say that this is probably the best CD to come out this year so far . Buy it now -- and go see them at Ozzfest .
 I 'm not going to lie , I downloaded Worship and Tribute the day it got leaked , mainly because GlassJAw is one of my favorite bands AND well . . I was curious . I wanted to see if they were going to make ETYNTKAS pt .2 or ascend to the next level like all great bands do.Well , they ascended alright . And damn did they ascend . Worship and Tribute is extremely varied , from straight up hardcore numbers like Stuck Pig , Pink Rose , and Tip Your Bartender to the more melodic songs like Must Have Run All Day and Ape Dos Mil . Every part of GlassJAw 's music has been enhanced . The album on a whole features more complicated guitar parts and some excellent bass work , not to mention Daryl 's cathartic vocals . He may not go screaming his head off in a flurry of rage as much as before , but his singing voice has just progressive ten fold.Though I must say the album does seem a little incomplete with Convectuso ... it 's still a very enjoyable experience that will end up being one of the years best releases . That is until dredg 's new album comes out
 If you liked glassjaws last effort `` everything you ever wanted to know about silence `` but thought it could have used a tune up in some areas , then you will really enjoy this album . Many people had gripes about things like the singers voice on the last album , but rest assued that Glassjaw has progresed as a band and it really reflects on Worship and Tribute . Glassjaw still maintains their range on this album but still manages to extend their style to excellent heights . I got an advance copy of this about 2 months ago and it still sounds as good as when i first got it , in fact i would say it sounds better . Theres something for everyone on this album , from hardcore to emo to punk , glassjaw covers the field and still makes it sound like their own . Worth checking out !!!!
 In this Glassjaw record , the band find themselves experimenting a little bit more . When I went to pick this cd up at Midnight on Tuesday morning , I was a bit doubtful -LRB- the whole 2nd album curse thing -RRB- . I bought the record , put it in the cd player in my car and listened to it . It was amazing , however , I did not get the full effect until I listened to it at home without any distractions . The guitars sound a lot more noisy on this record than the previous , and also classic Everything You Wanted to Know About Silence . Daryl 's voice is still the same - Soft , peaceful , and serene one minute ; Abrasive , and screaming the next . My only complaint is with Roadrunner Records which blocked the release of the song `` Convectuoso '' because Roadrunner says it is `` their '' song . By far , my favorite song on the record has to be `` The Gillette Cavalcade of Sports '' . The new album has been out for a total of 1 day now and already I 'm ready for more . I can not get enough of this band .
 First , let me just start by saying that the tracklisting on the front page is incorrect.Secondly , this cd is incredible , from start to finish . The boys really put out an amazing creation this time . It most definately rivals the first album in creativity , showing a very different style from the first . The music is a good twenty times more technical , and as always everything fits together perfectly.I 'd give the album six stars if possible .
 A great sophomore effort from this highly energetic New Yorkian emo-core five-piece . Seemingly more experimental and less intense than `` Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Silence '' at times -LRB- `` Ape Dos Mil , '' `` Must 've Run All Day '' -RRB- yet ferocious at others -LRB- `` Tip Your Bartender , '' and the album 's first single , `` Cosmopolitan Bloodloss '' . -RRB- Frontman Daryl Palumbo successfully makes my jaw hit the floor with his incredible vocal range for the second album in a row . The music is arguably even harder than EYEWTKAS , and the talented dual guitar craftsmenship ; the constant barreling of hardcore drum patterns ; and even a handful of creative basslines -LRB- see
 I just bought album a few hours ago , and have listened to it and have to say that it is great . I 've been a fan of Gj for a while , and this album is beyond what I expected . I went into this album with an open mind , not looking for another `` Siberian Kiss '' or the next `` Piano '' , I was listening to this as if I had never heard GlassJAw before , and I loved it . The songs on this album are wonderful , all as melodic as the can be angry , and beautifully written . I recommend this album to many people , but especially GlassJAw fans , because it 's new material with a bit of EYEWTKAS blended with new emotion and matured writting skills . Go buy it , you wo n't be disappointed .
 This was the album I was looking forward to all summer . I 'm very satisfied with the outcome of this album following Everything ... , which is one of the best albums in 5 years . Standout songs on this album are Tip your bartender , Cosmopolitan Bloodloss , Ape Dos Mil , The Gillette Cavalcade os Sports , and Trailor Park Jesus.I highly recommend it especially as I have just listened to it 3 times in a row without skipping tracks.Pick it up !
 These guys are amazing ... I have seen them in concert twice . The first time i didnt know who they were , and they rocked my face off . The second time I sure did know who they were and they put on an even better show . Now you may be telling yourself that `` this guy must be a Metal Head '' . The thing is , I am not . I listen to mostly Rap , Emo , and Jazz . In fact ... I HATE metal with a passion . Somehow though these guys play hard rock like no other . I bought this album thinking that these guys probably just put on a good show , but their album wouldent be nearly as good . Well again I prooved myself wrong . I have listened to this album at least once a week for the past year ... I think it is as good or better than Tupac 's Makeveli , or Nirvanas Nevermind .
 Right from the start by just looking at the album cover , I had a feeling this album was going to be a classic . It 's a fitting title to the vinyl record it displays its worship to , as the music is a tribute to those days passed.When this album came out in 2002 , it was almost like the music world needed this . Albeit , Glassjaw is somewhat underground , but true music fans know where to find good tunes when it 's out there . `` Worship & Tribute '' is a listening ride for your mind . Every track is placed together quite well . At times it will rock you out , and out of nowhere they know how to give you a break with a track of fantastic melodies.Lyrically , the vocalist has such an ambiguous way of telling you whats on his mind . It 's not a concept album , but the track titles are like the names of chapters in a book , and it 's up to you to decipher the meaning behind every song . I tend to get a very spiritual vibe , even though he ventures into anger , it 's still very philosophical without him trying to push his views on to you.Musically , I could care less what genre people try to label them as . There are always going to be bands that innovate on the genre they 're thrown into when there are other bands following that same trend with no creativity . Glassjaw is that band that broke free and gave us innovative material with `` Worship & Tribute '' . Six years have passed since this band has put out anything at all . And even though I 'm waiting to see if Glassjaw will ever put out another album , I can still come back to this one and always find another time of the year to enjoy this music .
 What a album . Classic album . Frontman Daryl Palumbo is a amazing singer . This is my favorite album that Daryl has been apart of . Everything You Ever Wanted To Know ... and the Head Automatica albums are great , but this one right here is his shining moment . I actually came across Glassjaw by a friend who played Mu Empire for me . It got me intrigued so I decided to check out the whole album . I was n't disapointed to say the least . This is just a fantastic album , and based of everyone 's else reviews , alot of people feel the same way . I 'd really like to see glassjaw get together and make another album . I think Daryl 's voice is better suited for this style of music than it is for Head Automatica -LRB- his other band -RRB- . My favorite tracks
 I just deiscovered these guys -LRB- oops , a little late . . oh well -RRB- and mucho mucho glad i did . Ca n't really be catoragized into one specific genre . Little hardcore , a tad of emo , some metalcore , and a lot of creativity . The singers voice is by far the best . I suggest you go and buy the CD -LRB- the samples here do n't do much for ya -RRB- . I mean I did , and i love it -LRB- and i 'm usually listening to thrash , metalcore or math metal -RRB-
 Ok ... so of course , as many of the other reviewers has mentioned , this album just cant be compared to their others ... They , like nearly all bands , change with albums , and things didnt just randomly stop being so ! But thats not a bad thing in this case , its very different , but still oooooh so wonderful!This album is a bit less `` i will destroy you '' than the last ! Its still brutal at points -LRB- tip your bartender and so on ... -RRB- This album im guessing is them just exploring the further reaches of their musical talent ... They use alot of their older styling that makes you want to burn your house down in rage , but there are also songs that just make you sit back and smile -LRB- ape dos mil , my fav ! -RRB- . The songs will keep you in a specific mindset , set in place by Glassjaw themselves , with Daryl being your narrator on the emotional ride ! I cant sit here and just go and on about all the songs ... so ill just pick a few of my favs!Ape Dos Mil
 Daryl really uses his voice here as a sort of instrument , and Beck does some insane stuff on guitar , but you have to listen pretty closely to hear it . I prefer Manny over Dave on bass , but Dave is good . This cd is so damn pretty , EYETKAS is also , but some people ca n't get past the screaming because it 's too `` intense '' or something like that . It 's a shame if you do n't like any of Glassjaw 's work , because it 's so incredible that i ca n't even imagine a person not liking it , it just boggles my mind . Glassjaw is so unique , not emo , hardcore , nu-metal , all sorts of stuff i 've seen trying to label these guys , they 're just Glassjaw , they 're their own sound , every song they have released is good , some better than others of course . Not only is Daryl 's singing some of the most beautiful clean singing i know -LRB- another great clean singer is the dude from between the buried and me -RRB- , but his scream is so ill , nobody else screams like that . Buy this , buy everything else they release .
 Okay , the site has posted The Used track listing rather than Glassjaw : Glassjaw - Worship And Tribute 's track listing are as follows :1 . Tip Your Bartender2 . Mu Empire3 . Cosmopolitan Blood Loss4 . Ape Dos Mil5 . Pink Roses6 . Must Have Run All Day7 . Stuck Pig8 . Radio Cambodia9 . Cavalcade10 . Trailer Park Jesus11 . Two Tabs of Mescaline
 I picked up this cd after hearing `` Cosmopolition Bloodloss '' . . I could n't recommend a better album choice , the music is different . the vocals and lyrics are unique . . After buying this i bought `` Everything you ever wanted to know about silence '' and that was pretty good aswell . . but not as great as this album though . . All the tracks are exellecent , i ' v played this everyday for the last 4 months . . Ca n't wait for the next album ! \ m / Glassjaw Fan \ m /
 I just wanted to say
 I 've been a fan for a while and I was definitely not disappointed by worship and tribute . Sure it 's not nearly as hard as the first album but it does have it 's heavier parts -LRB- stuck pig , the beginning of mu empire -RRB- but the album is so much more melodic than the first that I feel it is a much stronger effort . I see nothing but good things in the future for glassjaw and head automatica looks promising . By the way for all you people you dig the gilette cavalcade of sports , the part in the middle/end part where there is the play by play announcer type stuff , that was taken from a frank zappa song off of joe 's garage called `` fembot in a wet t shirt '' you should check it out . Zappa was a huge influence on daryl and is an amazing musician .
 take my word ... this is one of the best cd 's ull ever find . the first cd of Glassjaw is great also . anyways , this cd has dynamics , great drumming and dope bass . if u wan na listen to some hardcore stuff , THIS IS IT ! get it . u wo n't be disaapointed .
 Wow , I see so many reviewers of this album bashing Worship and Tribute simply saying that ETYEWTKAS was harder and better ... How can you even compare this to that album ?! ETYEWTKAS was one of the most influential Hardcore/screamo albums ever made ! In my mind that CD the best of the best of the genre ! Sorry guys but no CD will ever top that one , not even worship and tribute . There 's just no way.So let 's talk about the album itself . Well it 's obviously less Angsty than their last , but Darly is still clearly pissed -LRB- just not as much -RRB- . It 's also clear that the various styles of music are still here . Yes , mixes of Hardcore , screamo , and even emo are here . Glassjaw prove again with this one
 After listening to this I did n't think that there was anything that was better out there in the hardcore world ... then I got a hold of Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Silence ... i like that album better , personally . This album still pretty much kicks ass though . It 's toned down from EYEWTKAS ... but there 's still just as much emotion behind it . Lots of good songs ... highly recomended
 WORSHIP THIS ALBUM , WORSHIP THIS BAND !! GLASSJAW REJUVENATED MY FAITH IN ROCK MUSIC . THE FIRST THING I EVER HEARD BY THEM WAS `` Cosmopolitan Blood Loss '' ON MTV . IT CAUGHT MY ATTETION AND I WENT TO D/L SOME MATERIAL.GLASSJAW WAS APPARENTLY PRETTY DOWNLOADABLE AT THAT TIME . I GOT THE WHOLE WORSHIP AND TRIBUTE ALBUM , AND HONESTLY HATED IT AT FIRST , BUT I WAS SO INTRIGUED BY IT . I KEPT LISTENING TO IT OVER AND OVER AND IT GREW ON ME LIKE ALL GREAT CD 'S DO . I NEVER LIKE THE REALLY GREAT MUSICIANS RIGHT OFF THE BAT . I GUESS IT 'S POSSIBLY BECAUSE THESE GREAT PEOPLE THAT MAKE THIS MUSIC , TRY AND CREATE SOMETHING ORINIGAL AND UNIQUE . SO SINCE IT WAS AGAINIST THE NORM , SO TO SPEAK , IT TOOK A LITTLE TIME TO GET USED TO . BUT GJ IS NOW MY FAVORITE BAND OF ALL TIME . DARRYL IS INSANE . HIS LYRICS REALLY SPEAK OF NOTHING ... AT LEAST NOTHING I CAN UNDERSTAND . BUT THE WAY HE SINGS IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT IT IS HE IS SINGING ABOUT , AND IS TRULY MOVED BY IT AND FEELS IT . UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE READ MANY RUMORS THAT SAY GLASSJAW IS NO MORE DUE TO TURMOIL IN THE BAND . I WOULD ADVISE ANYONE WHO IS A FAN OF THIS ALBUM TO CHECK OUT `` EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SILENCE '' GLASSJAW 'S 1ST MAJOR RELEASE ON ROADRUNNER . I LIKE THAT ONE MORE THAN THIS ONE BECAUSE IT DOES HAVE A HEAVIER FEEL TO IT . WHAT CAN I SAY I AM A METAL HEAD , HOWEVER 1ST AND FOR MOST I AM A MUSIC APPRECIATOR . I ENJOY THE WHOLE SPECTRUM OF MUSIC ... I 'M SURE EVERYONE ALREADY KNOWS THAT DARRYL IS THE SINGER FOR `` HEAD AUTOMATICA '' , BUT I ALSO WANT TO RECCOMEND `` 36 CRAZY FISTS '' NEW ALBUM `` SNOW CAPPED ROMANCE '' A LITTLE HAEVIER THAN GJ , BUT THEY HAVE A REALLY UNIQUE SINGER AS WELL . PEAACE OUT YALL GLASSJAW RULES !!!
 I ca n't believe that they added convectusso to the track line-up
 Qutie simply my most favorite album of all time just above their debt album . I dont think there has been this much talent in a band since the genre of rock was started
 My 22 year old cousin , who has been a hip-hop head his whole life , expanded his music listening to rock about 3 years ago , and he 's tha one who introduced GlassJAw to me . and man do I aprieciate it . I have alway been one of those people who could n't really stand rock , and more specifically tha bands that scream and s *** . But about 5-6 months ago -LRB- prolly less than that -RRB- , I decided to give rock a try , and went to glassjaw.com -LRB- when it was more than a merch site -RRB- , and listend to tha first song I saw , Ape Dos Mil . that led to me downloading it , and listening to it non-stop for about 1 week . After I had gotten Ape Dos Mil outmy system , I decided to D/L anther song , but this time , it was Siberian Kiss , witch -LRB- if your a glassjaw fan , you know -RRB- is much harder , and this was tha kinda stuff I could n't stand . But , I decided to give it a chance . It quickly bacame my favorite song , and I D/Led more songs . I finnaly found Worship & Tribute , and bought it . like a week after that I found out about Head Automatica , and instantly bought that . Now , I am a Daryl Palumbo nut . tha dudes Voice is hella sick -LRB- especially Ape Dos Mil -RRB- , and I 've seen some live videos , and there shows look amazing . unfortunately , dude to tha side projects , Daryl 's battle with Crohns Disease , and some obvious disintrest within tha band , it looks like I will never get to see them live . but never tha less , now that you know my life story , you would understand that GlassJAw 's music is definitly worth tha $ 13.99 , or , because there albums are hard to find , you should n't feel to gutily for D/Ling . just expirence tha music , it 's good stuff ...
 If perfection is the combination of noises and tones , then you have the newest GlassJAw for an example . I 've always thought that Everything You Ever Needed to Know About Silence was an awesome album , but Worship and Tribute definitely takes the cake . The controlling , emotional rawness of Daryl 's voice is just amazing , with the guitar to move perfectly along with the lyrics , and be just as innovated song after song is what I needed , and they Got it . I can not say enough about this album , and all its glory . I am going to go speed around in my car just to listen to it over , and over .
 i recall the day i went and purchased `` everything you need to know about silence . '' i was distraught , and could n't even listen past the fifth song because i was so utterly disgusted with the sound that glassjaw was putting forth . then , i gave it more a listen . and as i became more desensitized to music , started to realize the talent of what had come before me . they had their own sound , something that comes hard in the days of -LSB- junk -RSB- like
 This Album should get people , who refused to accept that Glassjaw had talent and said that their previous Album `` Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Silence '' was below average , to sit up and take notice . Glassjaw are heading for a new direction with this release . And it 's definitely a natural direction.Vocalist Darryl Palumbo is very underrated . He 's a highly talented singer who just seems to get better on this Album . The tunes on this Album range from heavy-angry to melodic quickly , sometimes in the same song . `` EYEWTKAS '' had much the same feel to it , but i think personally , that on this Album . . Glassjaw have perfected their sound . It sounds newer , and more defined.The highlights on this Album would be `` Tip Your Bartender '' , `` Mu Empire '' , `` Cosmopolitan Bloodloss '' , `` Ape Dos Mil '' , `` Pink Roses '' , `` Must Have Run All Day '' , `` Radio Cambodia '' , `` Cavalcade '' and `` Two Tabs of Mescaline '' . Every song has it 's own catchy-ness , and is totally listenable.Darryl Palumbo 's voice is unbelievable , especially , on tracks like `` Ape Dos Mil '' , `` Pink Roses '' and `` Must Have Run All Day '' . Those 3 tracks in particular , are very melodic and they also set the mood somewhat for the whole Album . This Album , i think , is a huge turnaround really from what they sounded like on `` EYEWTKAS '' . Most of the songs have the same heaviness to them , and the same catchy-ness . . But there 's just something about this Album . . It 's AS good as `` EYEWTKAS '' , if not better in some parts , and i truly believe that people who disliked their debut Album will enjoy this Album alot more.I think Glassjaw deserve alot more praise than they seem to be getting . They mix up Hardcore/Emo/Punk / Metal , and turn it into something very special . Darryl Palumbo is as talented as Mike Patton . The lyrics are unique , and somewhat poetic . Glassjaw are just a top-quality band , that if you do like any of the Hardcore/Emo/Punk / Metal genres , you will surely enjoy them . I give this Album an easy 5/5 . It 's just that good .
 `` This is a war !!! '' Daryl shrieks on the musical call to arms ` Tip Your Bartender ' . It certainly feels like one.Second track ` Mu Empire ' does the impossible and steps up the levels of both intensity and melody , and features one of Glassjaw 's trademark sublime choruses . ` Cosmopolitan Bloodloss ' and ` Ape Dos Mil ' are more accessible than anything they 've written before , yet this does n't sacrifice any of the intelligence or complexity they 're known for . Sixth track ` Must 've Run All Day ' is a revelation , featuring guitarist Todd Weinstock on the E-Bow . The record 's most gentle track explodes into its heaviest - the brutal ` Stuck Pig ' . This song might scare those people who bought ` W/T ' for 11 Cosmopolitan Bloodloss 's , and in that respect is remeniscant of ` Hurting and Shoving ' off their debut . The last three tracks show Glassjaw at their most progressive . ' ... Cavalcade ... ' might not make much sense at first , but pulls itself together with the last gut wrenching chorus , with Daryl repeating `` Home is where the heart is ... on the bus '' . ` Trailer Park Jesus ' features a beautiful latticed melody and nice ethnic drumming , but sounds inconsequencial compared to the albums transcendent closer ` Two Tabs of Mescaline ' . A monolith of a track , it tears itself apart on numerous melodic tangents before ending in a tornado of distortion . An aural punch to the stomach.Unlike most bands currently enjoying their 15minutes , you sense Glassjaw need to play their music because their lives depend on it . Every chord sounds like release and every note sounds like it was ripped from their souls . And in their frontman , they have a singer who is willing to share his feelings , thoughts and beliefs . ` W/T ' is a beautifully melodic and emotional record , one that you can fall in love with and believe in when all your Korn or Sum41 albums have drained you and left you feeling hollow and used ...
 This album kills their last . This one is way more raw , loud and noisy . But also more melodic . They have managed to flesh out their sound and experiment enough to stand out from the rest of SCREAMO . More inspired than most , Glassjaw have an energy ; a creative edge consisting of both brains and brauns . And the lead singer , ... that mug can scream ! They have made their mark in hardcore - with this album , they are well on their way to joining the ranks of alterna-metal pioneers/revolutionaries/extraordinaires such as Deftones , Hum , Tool ... i know thats saying alot . But this album drips with ingenuity , art , and uncompromised sound - quenching my thirsty ears.GlassJaw continue to push the envelope ... Ca n't wait for the next 1 .
 Wow was the only thing that i could say after listening to W & T. I 've been a huge fan of glassjaw since their debut album came out a couple years back . I ca n't say that i 've been an old school fan of them because i never was , but i know about them enough to name them as one of my favorite bands ever . The emotion and energy on this album is truly amazing . I 've never heard so many powerful songs in one album before . The lyrics are strange and sometimes do n't make sense , but there is always a meaning behind the songs . If you 're a fan of their last album EYEWTKAS i 'm not sure what you will think of this album . I 've read mixed reviews anywhere ranging from Amazing to The worst album ever made . It 's another one of those albums where there is a line drawn between new and old fans . I believe that if you are a true fan of the band you 'll enjoy everything they do and if they feel like branching out and making different kinds of music then i think you should keep your mind open and accept the changes and listen to it for what it is . GJ is an amazing band and are an amazing group of guys . Daryl has one of the most mesmerizing voices i 've ever heard . All the songs are pretty much covered by previous reviews , but i 'm just going to say that every single track on this album , every second that passes by when you 're listening is worth your time and money . They have done it again ... Worship & Tribute is truly an album that will be worshipped and tributed in the future .
 Forget about all other Glassjaw albums for the moment ; THIS album is their zenith . I discovered this album , and band for that matter , at a time when I was having `` scene '' crammed down my throat . This album was my messiah from the music that was surrounding it at the time , and probably even more so now . This band reassured me on this album that melody and brute could be combined , and feeling could be expressed in rock music without having to fit into tight pants to do so . Worship and Tribute does a great job of lightly grazing trends yet still doing business on its own terms . Palumbo is iconoclastic with tight vocal melodies and lyrics that imply a dark sense of humor . The guitarists work off of each other creating harmonies that seem avant-garde in this era of rock while being anchored by smooth basslines that fit right in the pocket the drummer creates . Not to mention that the double-bass effect created by the single-pedal wielding drummer on `` mu empire '' is simplistically genius . I also once heard this album was tracked all at once by the band the way it would have been done back in the day , which i think is impressive . On the general rock side of things , Worship and Tribute is one of my all time favorites .
 Right now in the popular music arena there are several bands -LRB- Thursday , Taking Back Sunday , Finch , etc. -RRB- that are cranking out emo music with literate lyrics , screaming and hardcore-ish guitar riffs woven in at all the right places.Glassjaw should not be grouped in with these bands . They offer much , much more.On Worship and Tribute , Glassjaw have taken their adrenalized emo/hardcore act and perfected it . The music retains its own original style even as it ranges over very complex and radical shifts , both mid-song and from track to track , in intensity and style . From their last album , Palumbo has matured as a vocalist . He seems to have gained more control over his voice , which means that his characteristic mood swings are much more focused and expertly delivered.Glassjaw uses dynamics to create the emotion in their music . Sounds obvious , I know , but many of these bands nowadays start at loud and only change dynamics by screaming -LRB- sometimes , they write slow songs , but they are slow songs that are written to be slow songs and achieve nothing else -RRB- . On Worship and Tribute , songs intensify and relax to complement the intelligent -LRB- and sometimes obtuse -RRB- lyrics . The effect is truly emotional music that is not only charged but cathartic.This is a band that only gets better and better . Their songs range so many dynamics that I highly recommend taking the time and listen to all of the 30 second clips Amazon has posted to get some idea of what the whole album offers .
 I 've been a fan of glassJAw for years.And I 've literally watched their sound progress.I 've read a lot of customer reviews and a lot of them are bashing glassJAw saying `` glassJAw is n't tough anymore . `` I 've listened to Worship and Tribute everyday since its release.Now when I listen to EYETKAS , it is n't what glassJAw is today!The music on W/T is simply amazing.Every track on this album has it 's own mood.And it 's an album I could listen to on repeat.Worship and Tribute was 2002 's greatest album.I can not wait to see what glassJAw pumps out next.PS - Head Automatica is lead by Daryl Palumbo.Go out and buy their Debut album `` Decadance ''
 ... this is a brilliant album , but you may not recognize it as such immediately . I certainly did n't , but now that I have , I ca n't say enough great things about this wonderful , wonderful band known as Glassjaw . When I originally was planning to sit down and construct this review , I was planning on giving the album just four stars , since I hold only my most favorite and enjoyable albums in the ` five star quality ' status . But when I sat down to listen to the album while typing up my review , I realized , I can think of no reason to mark it down to anything less than five stars . I absolutely love every song on the album , save `` Trailer Park Jesus '' , and it 's hard for me to find anything negative to say about this band or this release . If you own the first album , Everything You Wanted To Know About Silence , and have not yet been treated to this one , definitely it pick it up . It is more mature and mellowed than the first album , but certainly not any less emotional . You can really see how far they 've all come as a band . If you are new to Glassjaw , then by all means , make Worship and Tribute the next album purchase you make . The packaging is one of the best ever , and the album inside is pure hardcore bliss . It may take some time to really get into it , but once you do , I think you 'd have a hard time ever viewing music the same way again . Buy this album , you wo n't regret it ...
 In a reasonably new genre where everyone sounds like the same handful of bands , Emo newcomers Glassjaw are a breath of fresh air . With the pop sensibility of early Thursday , or american football , and an agressive edge reminiscent of deftones `` adrenaline '' , Glassjaw prove themselves on `` Worship and Tribute '' . This album is the most beautiful and angry thing I 've ever heard.For fans of
 Yeah ! This album is supurb ! I bought both GlassJaw albums together , so at first I did n't really like this album that much , cause GlassJaws Debut Album EYEWTKAS grabbed me by the nuts and did n't let go ! After a little time I gave this Album a good listen and discovered the true meaning of life ! Oh yeah , It 's terrific . If only the song El Mark were on this Album ! It really should be ! It probably was going to be but they could n't finish it in time or something?Heres a shot run down and score of each song ! 1 -RRB- Tip You Bartender - 10/10I love this song . Perfect opener ! It 's right up my alley ! Simple but real cool . The verse is crazy and wild . Then comes the chorus , after a few times your hooked . The chorus is huge sounding , yet quite simple . I adore that chorus .2 -RRB- Mu Empire - 9/10This song has probably the most stunning moment I ever heard in a song ! Where he sings `` Ah , I Do , I Do !! '' Gold , I love it ! Verse is very good . Only the riff in the intro is a tad messy ! But still cool ! Also very well arranged song in my opinion ! 3 -RRB- Cosmopolitan Bloodloss - 9/10One of the singles to this album ! If only the chorus '' After all , After all , '' were a little less annoying this would be my favorite song ! The verses are so cool , and the bridge section is really good too .4 -RRB- Apes Dos Mil - 8.5 / 10Another single . This song is a real chick pleaser . Girls love it ! I like the verse a lot . However I it 's a bit art-ty for me , I was never really into these sorta songs , but I do like this song ! 5 -RRB- Pink Roses - 9/10Pretty crappy verse , but all is forgiven when the chorus kicks in ! Astonishing . I love that chorus . First time I heard it I was addicted ! Perfect ! 6 -RRB- Must 've Run all Day - 8.5 / 10Similar style to Apes Dos Mil . I like the music in this song better though . Pretty intro guitars . Intro vocals are a bit piercing . `` If it makes you . '' Otherwise a very pretty song . I know this and Apes Dos Mil are a lotta peoples favorites and thats cool , but this slow sorta music is n't really my scene .7 -RRB- Stuck Pig - 6/10My least listened too song on this album . Pretty messy song . I do n't dislike messy music , but this is definately the worst song on the album . The chorus is cool though when the whole band thumps together . I like his voice here .8 -RRB- Radio Cambodia - 10/10Only fast song on the album . Thats why I thought El Mark should have been on this album too . I do n't like punk that much but this song rocks ! GlassJaw are great at fast/punk tunes . This is one of my favoritre songs on the record ! 9 -RRB- The Gillette Calvacade of Sports - 10/10Amazing ! Epic song . Genius , Great , Grand ! I love this song ! Best guitar I have heard in ages in this song ! The chorus is awesome `` This is n't where , This is n't where I found you . '' The middle section is real funny and very flashy ! `` That was a good one Bob , '' You got ta listen to this one all the way ! 10 -RRB- Trailor Park Jesus - 8/10Not usually my style , but I really do like this song ! I got a soft spot for the intro verse he sings ! I do n't know why ? I guess it 's just fun to sing along too . The chorus is a bit annoying though . So yeah ! 11 -RRB- Two Tabs of Mescaline - 10/10Awesome end to and awesome album . Most people love this song after getting used to it ! Intro guitars annoy me a bit . Otherwise a marvellous song ! Check this one out ! It has so much in it ! Innovative vocals , Awesome arrangements ! There is no band that sound or come close to this song ! A Good song to check out first , if you 've never heard GlassJaw ! Listen to the whole song though . You gotta.In the End of the day this album is probably the better of the two GlassJaw albums . But only marginally . There first one has some of the finer moments and is pure chaos and wildness . But this one is a slightly more mature album for GlassJaw.I give Worship and Tribute - 99/100 . -LRB- only cause I think its missing a song ! -RRB- I give Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence - 98/100 .
 every song on this album is amazing beleive me go buy it now . my favorate song on the album is traile park jesus , the chorus is extreamly uplifting when i listen to it it always puts a smile on my face . this album is best listened to on headphones while walking somewhere but is equally enjoyable indoors . what else can i say apart from amazing band .
 This cd is absolutely awesome!Daryll 's voice is great , the musicianship is excellent.This is an all around great cd.BUY IT !!!
 This is a really good , now what would you call it , punky emo hardcore band ? Sort of what you would get combining good Incubus with At the Drive In or Sparta . It 's really good with a lot of really solid catchy tracks . It 's fun for the whole family and this comming from a guy who is n't a big punk or emo fan . I saw them live a while back with Sparta and Dredg , and they rocked out then.Cosmopilion Blood Loss is my favourite track . Get it , you 'll be suprised at how much you liky it .
 no other band can be compared to glassjaw because they sound like no other band out there . daryl palumbo is the best singer i have ever heard . he has the best range of any other singer in any other band , i dare to put him against anyone else in a singing contest ... even chino moreno or brandon boyd ... he 's just that good . as for the band , they are all amazing , both guitar players the bassist and the drummer . the reason i like ... no ... love glassjaw so much is for the simple reason that they sound like no other band out there . if you want something totaly different , unique and amazing , go out and buy both glassjaw cd 's -LRB- Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Silence , and Worship & Tribute -RRB- rite now ... trust me ... you will not be disapointed at all ... and remember ... `` Denile is a river in Egypt . '' Glassjaw 4 Life !!!
 glassjaw is one of my favorite bands and i must say that i was impressed with this cd . every single song on it is completely different and it 's definetely a cd you need to add to your music collection if you care for this type of music
 this album , `` worship and tribute '' is an awesome album by glassjaw . daryl 's voice is very sexy , and it chimes throughout the cd causing you to gear your attention at what is being said.there is no known musical genre to put this album into , for it is too great to be demoralized by labels . the guitar riffs and drums play of similarity to incubus , while daryl 's voice can wail and coo liek chino moreno 's . it is just too splendid to even put into words . it si great .
 First off , this cd is great . It is a bit different from `` EYEWTKAS , '' but it is still great . I think these people talking about being liked the Used and bands like that need to broaden their horizons . Pick up Glassjaw 's first CD as a start , especially if you like this one . And for the idiot that said this album was poorly produced , I really hope that was some deep sort of sarcasm . Ross Robinson produced them both , and if anyone knows who he is , then you would n't be talking about poor production . Anyways , that 's my take ... pick both cd 's up !
 Better than E.Y.E.W.T.K.A.S. !! One of the best albums ever written . So beautiful , so intense ; just amazing !!
 There are few moments in a man 's life when you can look back and think , `` That is the exact second everything changed . '' The first time I heard Cosmopolitan Bloodloss , I knew something happened . I could not put my finger on it until I simply had to go out and buy the album of a band no one knew . One trip to Best Buy and $ 20.00 later my life in regards to music was altered going forward . I 'm not going to compare DP 's singing to anyone in recent `` below-the-radar '' fame because I do n't know any of them . I have no idea how good the bass player is on this album , I do n't know music like that . All I can tell you is that my friends and I constantly have conversations consisting of the `` Top 3 Albums of All Time '' , before my purchase of W&T they were , in this order :1 . Jay-Z , Reasonable Doubt2 . Wu-Tang Clan , Enter the 36 Chambers3 . Notorious B.I.G. , Ready to Die.Post purchase of W&T , the order has changed slightly :1 . Jay-Z , Reasonable Doubt2 . Glassjaw , Worship & Tribute3 . Wu-Tang Clan , Enter the 36 ChambersThat in itself should speak multitudes above any silly comparison I could come up with if I knew everything about music . Hell of a compliment too!Growing up in the inner-city you do n't have very many opportunities to fall upon great music in genre 's such as Screamo , Hardcore , Punk , Emo , etc. . I thank goodness I got the opportunity to do so with this . Thank you Glassjaw !
 I am so glad to have discovered Glassjaw . Whenever things got me down , this CD is my therapy . Many times this CD has found it 's way in my CD player while driving home from a bad night . Out of all bands I have discovered Glassjaw 's lead singer Darryl Palumbo 's lyrics will always be the ones I relate to the most . He also has one of my favorite voices out there . Now people may throw the term `` emo '' around nowadays , but when Darryl says something you feel like your right there with him feeling his pain and frustration . Anybody who has ever known me has always known I try my hardest to follow the straight edge lifestyle before I even knew what the term meant . I know lately I have not been doing very well on walking the straight path , but I plan to one day get back on track . Lead singer Darryl does not do drugs , drink , nor have sex . Last interview I read when he was 23 he was still a virgin , which is very admirable . This album unlike the previous `` Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence '' , actually has some slow ballads which are so beautiful , matching the vocals . The lyrics are very vague and have personal meaning to Darryl , he is n't too straight forward so the listener can take things their own way , but I believe there are songs on this album about abortion , broken hearts , conflicting religions , drug addicts , radio , fashion , so many topics are covered . The first time I heard this album was a few years ago at a listening station and I was n't too big on it , but once I had a greater appriciation for music and actually listened to everything that was being said , it suprisingly has marched it 's way all the way up to my # 2 album of all time .
 This cd has actually given me hope again in the dull rock music industry right now where pop-emo and neo-grunge rule . Dont get me wrong , Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Silence was amazing ... but this cd is nothing short of brilliant . Their improvement was so great you wonder what could be next . Palumbo shows his great dynamic and range which most bands lack and their is intricate dual guitar and bass work that oddly match his melodies . I 'm not much of a drummer but i know this guy is spot on . I always wonder why Glassjaw is compared to and categorized with the `` emo '' bands such as Thrice , Brand New , Coheed & Cambria etc. . . I think Glassjaw is a completely different genre and although i like most these bands , they are obviously miles high above these bands . If you simple chord progressions and shallow voices you can look elsewhere . I highly recommend this to anybody with any love for music .
 I do n't care about kissing anyone 's a $ $ ... strait edge , bully , emo or otherwise . That having been said , this disc takes a few listens before you can really see what is happeing . My first reaction was confusion ... too much going on to grab ahold of , but after a good five close listens I came to the conclution that this is one of the greatest CDs ever recorded . Palumbo gives me goosebumbs . I have always been a huge Mike Patton fan , but I never thought anyone could follow his lineage with this degree of sheer grace . Palumbo 's words are so well crafted and the notes he chooses for them expand their meaning in such a way that I can only describe it as deeply inspiring for me as a vocalist and as a writer . This may not be your cup of tea -LRB- given -RRB- , but I see this as a flawless masterpiece . I do n't have any other CD 's that sound like this . This is my top ten list of perfect CDs -LRB- in no order -RRB-
 Straying from the hardcore-like vocals of eywtkas , glassjaw put together a beautiful album , alternating tracks between harder/faster and mellower/slower . Unfortunately the mixing of Mike Fraser on all of the tracks -LRB- except # 3 -RRB- is very rough sounding and lacks the crispness of the tracks on eywtkas or even Cosmopolitan Bloodloss . I would have gave it 5 stars but , this holds it back .
 Ah ... i love the sound of glassjaw . The band has unbelivable talent and you will always hear it in there music . I bought this cd and i had only heard the song ` Cosmopolitan Bloodloss ' so i got it . Right away my skull was charged with the energy if this band ! i was like `` holy sh*t ! this band is insane '' as i listened to the cd it was clear they knew how to create bueatiful and hardcore riffs but also had a signifigance about themsevels . The song ` Pink Roses ' , ` Ape Dos Mil ' , and ` Trailer Park Jesus ' are increadible ! If you get one cd make sure it 's this one you wount be dissappointed !
 i 'll admit i didnt get this cd until recently , over a year after release , but since i bought it i havent stopped listening to it . this is one of the best albums i have ever heard , quickly moving into my top 5 , along with 311 -LRB- music -RRB- , Incubus -LRB- SCIENCE -RRB- , the used ... some good company ... pick up this album if you have not heard it yet , it will be well worth it , i have already converted a few people with these songs ... 5/5
 Worship and Tribute takes the intensity of Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence and disseminates it across all the tracks so instead of going balls out and screaming for the whole CD it packs this emotion into crescendos and certain moments , which makes them all the more significant . This CD also emphasizes a more experimental vein in hardcore where guitar and bass dynamics are interesting and fittingly tight or loose -LRB- former can be seen on the intro to `` Two Tabs of Mescaline '' and the latter can be seen in the raw fury of `` Pink Roses '' -RRB- . The most striking element of this album , though , is Daryl Palumbo 's vocals . In a concentrated and non-ADD-like way he jumps between octaves and his voice often soars with booming power , which complements the poignant lyrics that are more varied than those of Glassjaw 's previous album . The album has many highlights but the showstopper is `` Ape Dos Mil . '' This track combines a slower intro with a more powerful and chugging chorus , which build to a string-laden crescendo . This album only falls behind Thrice 's `` The Illusion of Safety '' and Dredg 's `` El Cielo . ''
 First off , GlassJAw are NOT trying to copy At the Drive-In as some idiot suggested . GlassJAw are trying to create a sound of their own , and man do they succeed ! In this album Daryl Palumbo 's lyrics are slightly more simplistic than in EYEWTKAS , as well as the music itself . But I find W/T to be more enjoyable than EYEWTKAS , and that 's saying a lot ! This time the music flows more easily along with Daryl 's singing , and what 's refreshing is that Daryl sings more than screams so you can actually understand what he is saying . Do n't get me wrong though , the songs themselves are still hard to figure out as to what the meanings of them are , heh . But that 's one of the main reasons why I like GlassJAw , they are not only unpredictable but they make you think instead of just understanding the meanings of the songs right off the bat . My favorite songs are `` Tip Your Bartender , '' `` Mu Empire , '' `` Cosmopolitan Blood Loss , '' `` Ape Dos Mil , '' `` Pink Roses , '' `` Must 've Run All Day , '' and `` Trailer Park Jesus . '' Even so though all the songs on here are enjoyable beyond belief , but I suggest you download some songs first because the GlassJAw sound is not for everyone . It was for me though. : -RRB-
 With `` Worship and Tribute , '' Glassjaw have showed a large amount of maturity since their debut . Gone , are the angsty lyrics about rotten girls -LRB- which were great . -RRB- Instead , they 've expanded their lyrical horizons to other topics.There is still heaviness in their music , -LRB- `` Tip Your Bartender , '' `` Pink Roses , '' and `` Stuck Pig '' -RRB- but there is more of a groove on `` Worship and Tribute . '' All of the tracks fit together , without sounding like each other.After listening to this album , people will no longer label Glassjaw as a `` nu-metal band . ''
 What can you say about Glassjaw 's debut , `` Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence '' ? In my opinion , it is one of the best albums ever , and would be very hard to follow up with their sophomore outting . `` Worship and Tribute '' is a showcase of how much Glassjaw have matured since their first album . Though it does n't have quite as much emotion as the first , it is NOT `` Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence part 2 '' , and that 's what 's cool about it.The disc starts you off with a hard-hitting tune that is reminiscent of Glassjaw 's `` Kiss Kiss Bang Bang '' days . It then proceeds into the amazing tracks `` Mu Empire '' and `` Cosmopolitan Bloodloss '' . After working out agression in the first three tracks , `` Ape Dos Mil '' brings a sense of beauty to the beginnings of the cd , only to be blown one hundred feet up in the air by the hardcore track `` Pink Roses '' , another track reminding us all of the `` Kiss Kiss Bang Bang '' days . After `` pink Roses '' comes in one of the most beautiful and sincere songs you can have on an album . `` Must 've Run All Day '' brings amazing lyrics and guitar work to the table . Just when you have to recollect yourself after `` Must 've Run All Day '' , the album catches that vulnerability , and shoots into the heavy track `` Stuck Pig '' . `` Radio Cambodia '' is essentially the `` Ry Ry 's Song '' of `` Worship and Tribute '' , bring a pop-punk sound to the record.I 'm convinced the last three songs on the album are a stroke of genius . `` Cavalcade '' is an amazing song , where Daryl turns into a race anouncer in the bridge of the song . `` Trailerpark Jesus '' reminds me a lot of the song `` Piano '' on the last record . Then you have the emotional tune `` Two Tabs of Mescaline '' . `` Two Tabs . . '' captures that emotion and sincerity that we all know and love Daryl 's lyrics for . An amazing song.This is a must have album . It showcases amazing guitar work , amazing lyrics , and the maturity of the band . Any fan of Glassjaw should be very pleased with it . I know I am .
 Having fallen under the categories of emo-core , post-hardcore , and even nu-metal with their debut album EYEWTKAS - none of which accurately describes the band - Glassjaw has returned with their new record , which finds the group taking the basic fundamentals of their ideas and expanding them , resulting in a sound that is determined to shatter previous misconceptions and defy categorization . Style wise , Glassjaw has , in the past , been compared to such bands as the Deftones , ATDI , and various other emo/hardcore-related acts , though in truth these comparisons do not do them justice as the NY-based quintet is simply a rock band at heart , with their music containing an assortment of emo/indie/punk / hardcore tendencies . Staying true to that formula , Glassjaw continues to wield their chaotic hybrid of colliding post-hardcore , emo-rock , & punk-metal , though this time around , the sound is much more melodically accessible , features greater refined song structures , and possesses a more polished sheen , all of which can be attributed to the maturity & evolution of the band , which in turn , has resulted in stronger songwriting and tighter musicianship . Musically , Glassjaw creates lush , multi-layered soundscapes composed of the band 's trademark , distorted guitarplay & inventive sonics , complemented by a sturdy rhythm section that features unique time signatures & versatile drum work , all of which is executed in a manner that is both organically raw & technically precise . Meanwhile , completing the visceral beauty of Glassjaw 's sonic landscape , is the presence of frontman Daryl Palumbo , whose volatile collage of smothering harmonies , brutal hardcore-influenced screams , and intensely personal lyrics ignites with unbridled emotional release against the group 's musical backdrop . Overall , Glassjaw has improved drastically as musicians & songwriters , and in the process have perfected a sound that may lack the crude directness & vivid contrasts of past efforts , yet is all the more compelling for the direction their music has taken , embracing both accessible & unconventional methods.Significantly titled Worship And Tribute , Glassjaw 's highly anticipated sophomore effort and Warner Bros. debut , is an emotionally-charged 11-track epic that not only pays tribute to such influences as Bad Brains , Anthrax , The Cure , and The Squeeze , but also refers to the worship-tribute relationship that is involved with those you love . For Daryl Palumbo , the album is also a representation of the elements that affect him emotionally , whether it is love , sex , or relationships to the business side of the band , the member 's maturation as musicians & songwriters , and his own metamorphosis from teen to adult . Beautifully , powerfully and accurately depicting these various thoughts & emotions are the eleven songs found on Worship And Tribute , ranging from such violent-inspired tracks as the caustic opening song Tip Your Bartender and the aggressive Stuck Pig with its stunning melodic breakdown , to the more melodically appealing songs as the radio-friendly Ape Dos Mil , the picturesque , leisure-like Must 've Run All Day , and the moving Trailer Park Jesus with its compelling choruses . Showcasing a stark contrast between cathartic , musical soundscapes and melodic-driven vocals are such tracks as Mu Empire and Pink Roses , while Cosmopolitan Bloodloss and the punk-influenced Radio Cambodia are more upbeat songs , with the former featuring catchy harmonics & choruses . Rounding out the album are the songs The Gillette Cavalcade of Sports and Two Tabs Of Mescaline , both of which are creatively inspired , displaying unique song arrangements , inventive musicianship and interesting breakdowns . One song however , that is noticeably lacking from the album is Convectuoso , a track that was originally intended to end Worship And Tribute and is perhaps Glassjaw 's most unconventional song to date - a tender , acoustic-like ballad with heartfelt vocals . Overall , from a creative & musical standpoint , Worship And Tribute is leaps & bounds above past efforts , though it can be argued that the album lacks the overall emotional intensity & conviction that saturates their debut effort EYEWTKAS . This of course , would be a result of many factors , including the growth of the band , the evolution of Daryl Palumbo , and the different topics & emotions that are explored on Worship & Tribute as opposed to EYEWTKAS . Looking past this , the album as a whole fearlessly walks the line between artistic creativeness and commercial appeal , resulting in an album that in the end , can be both confounding and compelling ...
 This is one of the best cds ive ever heard . Glassjaw is an extremly talented band and it shows on this cd . They 're grown up alot lyrically and musicaly since EYEWTKAS . This has been in my cd player since i got it and i love it . Now im gon na rate the songs :1 . Tip Your Bartender
 Glassjaw came onto the scene in 2000 with `` Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Silence , '' which I consider to be one of the best debut albums ever . EYEWTKAS was life altering for me . It completely blew me away , changed the structures of my ears and left me with my jaw slumped down to the floor . So , naturally , as the release of this album came closer and closer , my anticipation grew and grew and grew . I was overjoyed when I finally got my copy and put it into my CD player . Of course , like their first CD , this CD takes a couple of listens before you really get it . But once you get it , boy do you get it . The album starts off rightfully with the melody charged hard-rocker `` Tip Your Bartender '' and never lets up . On `` Worship & Tribute , '' Glassjaw 's style is a little more spread out . There is so much variety from song to song , it 's unbelieveable . The album 's most mellow and soothing moment , `` Must 've Run All Day '' is followed up immediately by the album 's heaviest track , `` Stuck Pig . '' Frontman Daryl Palumbo sings all of these songs with extreme ease and his voice sounds considerably better on this CD . The subject matter of his lyrics , for the most part , has changed . The last disc was all about bitterness towards love , but on this CD , he tackles more political issues and overall , international problems . The band has also gotten better at what they do . Everyone seems to be working together on this one and their effort is unbelieveable . They truly help convey the words that Daryl are singing . Highlights include
 After the success of their highly regarded debut `` Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Silence '' , the anticipation for Glassjaw 's second full length was more than a little . I myself spent months just waiting for this cd to be released . Three years ago I rushed to the store and picked this one up as fast as I could . The thing that most fans should realize is that you can not compare this album to EYEWTKAS , because these are two totally different albums . That was the mistake I initially made , and part of the reason why this album did n't do it for me in the beginning . But over time this album grew on me , and it took me a little while to fully realize how truely good this album was . If you were a huge fan of the debut , I 'm pretty sure you 'll feel the same way.Opening up the album we have `` Tip Your Bartender '' which is perfect . Heavy , full of energy and probably one of the best songs on the album . However after the first track , you 'll begin to notice a slight difference in the band on this release . First of all Daryl does n't scream as much as EYEWTKAS . This does n't really affect the music of the band though . At first I really made a big deal out of this , because I did n't realize how much Daryl 's singing had improved on this one . After a while though I did n't even care about the screaming . You just get attached to the songs , and would n't want to hear them any other way . Do n't worry though , there 's still plenty of heavy ones on here , like the afformentioned `` Tip Your Bartender '' , `` Stuck Pig '' , and `` Two Tabs Mescaline '' . This time around though , Glassjaw balances the album more evenly . For every heavy one , there 's a soft one , and it is n't just song after song of aggression . This can best be seen on songs like `` Ape Dos Mil '' , `` Must 've Run All Day '' and `` Trailer Park Jesus '' which are all moody and vibe oriented songs , that recall the success of previous songs like `` Her Middle Name Was Boom '' . The slow songs however are just as good as the heavy ones . It 's not often that I can honestly say that about most albums , but Glassjaw just always had a nact for writing good music , and this album is no different . Besides having both heavy and slow songs , Glassjaw also offers more than a few upbeat rockers in the vain of `` Ry Ry 's Song '' from the previous album . `` Mu Empire '' and `` Radio Cambodia '' are two great examples of this style . Besides the growing up musically , Glassjaw and Daryl have also grown up lyrically . While EYEWTKAS was all about hatred , despair and anger , this album has turned away and focused more on the things around them . Daryl has grown up a lot since the last album , and offers a more political and abstract approach to his songs , as apposed to their prior efforts . Overall every song on the album is perfect . The band 's musicianship is just as good , if not better , than EYEWTKAS . There 's just so many things I love about this album , and can easily listen to it on repeat over and over.Simply put you ca n't compare this with `` Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Silence '' . They are just two different albums . Each offers something unique and special , and each is a different side of Glassjaw . I could never pick a favorite between the two , because there 's just too much about both albums that I love . If you like Glassjaw , or emo , hardcore , punk , rock whatever , you should do yourself a favor and pick this one up . It 's well worth the money , and with Glassjaw 's reunion always getting put on hold more and more , this might very well be the last piece of music we get from these guys , which is a shame . However this album will still live on , and remain amazing .
 I reviewed Everything You Ever Wanted To Know . . a few years back . I did n't favor it too much . Sure , Piano , Sibirien Kiss , and When Two Eights Become One Zero were fantastic songs , and the band was HELLA talented ! But I just felt the rest of the songs were disposible . And I do n't care what anyone says , Daryal 's voice SUCKED one more then half the tracks on that album!So because of this experience I did n't give Worship & Tribute a fair chance till last year . This is the album I KNEW they could make ! The influence 's reach much wider on this album ! Their sound can be described as all the best parts of Fugazi , At The Drive-In and a little bit of Mr. Bungle . The influences even stretch as far as say , Portishead ?! This is a very well rounded album . Real expeimental song writting , passionate proformance and Daryal 's voice ROCKS !!! It just seems their almost going defunct . . Daryal 's Got Head Automatica which rocks , but I 've heard rumors that members of glassjaw have been replaced , and the new album is up in the air , and they 've been canceling shows and daryal 's been ill . It would be sad to see such a talented band go south when their carear seems so wide open .
 Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Silence is , and prolly always will be , one of my all-time favorite albums . . and after I had the pleasure of seeing them on tour with Converge , I knew I had to get this album . So , I had high expectations when I got Worship and Tribute . Were they met?Indeed . It 's not EYEWTKAS Pt . 2 , but its spectacular . Daryl 's voice has improved a lot . He does n't go into any random bouts of screaming like he did on EYEWTKAS , but that does n't mean he does n't scream anymore . You want hardcore ? Listen to Tip Your Bartender or Stuck Pig ... Metal ? Try the first single , Cosmopolitan Bloodloss . Radio Cambodia has this really punk-like vibe to it . And Must 've Run All Day -LRB- currently my favorite song -RRB- is just beautiful . But , the one song I think everyone will be talking about for a while is Ape Dos Mil . It has lots of melody , and is n't like ... insane . If released as a single , I bet it would be big . The entire album is terrific , its been hard for me to take it out of my CD player since I got it . I definetly recommend it to any metal/hardcore/punk kids out there .
 Ah yes ! The time has finally come ! New Glassjaw is here in the form of `` Worship and Tribute '' they 're unbelievable Junior effort . After creating one of the most emotional efforts ever with 2000 's `` Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence '' Glassjaw had set the bar and fans have held high expectations for the new album . Were they met ? I do n't have a 5-star rating for this CD for nothing ! It 's met all the expectations and more . The CD is so incredible . Daryl does not scream as much , but he sings more . His voice has REALLY developed since the last album . His lyrics are as great as ever . The music on this CD is so moving , it 's just an experience to listen to -LRB- as all Glassjaw is -RRB- . My excitement right now is so intense . All I have to say is ... if you like Glassjaw , or have never heard of them ... you will absolutely LOVE this album . BUY IT !
 Glassjaw broke into the mainstream with EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SILENCE , their 2000 debut with a decidedly punk/hardcore take on melodic rock . The follow-up finds them toning down the hardcore elements and emo tendencies just a notch or two in favor of even more melody and diversity , resulting in a listen that stands the test of time much better.There really is n't much point in doing a track-by-track analysis or highlighting my favorite songs , because they 're all great . I 've always had a weak spot for any album that swirls through a dozen or so tracks without ever relying on filler , becoming redundant , or slowing down for segues and straightforward radio-hit attempts , so giving this five stars is a no-brainer . Plus , whoever writes the riffs for this band is a melodic genius , consistently showering the listener with all the right chord progressions -- even with styles and moods as disparate as you 'll find switching from `` Pink Roses '' to `` Gillette Cavalcade . '' Vocalist Daryl Palumbo is nothing if not unique , and while he 'll inevitably grate a certain segment of listeners beyond any chance of redemption , I find his presentation ingenious at its best moments and still easily tolerable at its worst.WORSHIP & TRIBUTE is one of the meatier and better-written hard rock records of the 2000s , probably falling short of mega-success only because of the reputation that lagged over from Glassjaw 's more abrasive and divisive hardcore roots . Even if you are n't into punk or emo , do n't make the mistake of overlooking this universally-enjoyable masterpiece of melody .
 As the title says , this album is excellent , except for the slow songs . `` Ape Dos Mil '' relies on an obvious rhyme with cursing and is off-putting . `` Must 've Run All Day '' has an awkward Daryl singing `` come ` ere '' creepily . Rest of the album is tremendous , especially side B -LRB- Stuck Pig onward -RRB- . The first three songs are rad , too .
 It 's hard to write a review for an album that approaches perfection like Worship & Tribute . From the panning power chords at the start `` Tip your Bartender '' to Daryl Palumbo 's blistering shrieks at the end of `` Two Tabs of Mescaline '' , this album is a must-have for anyone who loves intense , and original music . I ca n't say much more than that . You 'll know if its for you when you hear it .
 The first review of this album I read , made it seem like its the worst piece of trash ever written , and some have agreed here on amazon . I simply want to put fare and honest judgement to this album.First off , Glassjaw 's major label debut `` eyewtkas '' is simply the most amazing thing ever recorded and there for after hearing it basically made it seem no album could ever be anybetter . That is the mindstate I had going into this album -LRB- and it helped -RRB- because this cd is deffinetly not as good as the first . But , its also not near as bad as its rumored to be . Daryls vocals dont seem to have quite the angst as previoius , but then again it only makes sense . After being in a band and even opening for the deftones , changes a person and the same things dont affect them . Therefor , if the lyrics and vocals were just as angry and upset I would think something is wrong and that they are turning into another Korn.Secondly , these songs are much more rough around the edges . The first was more directed to a specific diretion , but this one seems less a concept album , more a collection of songs . Which is n't necessarily a bad thing . It does take a few listens to soak up and enjoy the album , though.Thirdly , there still ARE amazing spots in the album , and even including a few spots of daryl 's patented scream , mainly on `` Tip Your Bartender . '' as well as a completely amazing fast tongued mid break on '' ... cavalcade ... '' As well as mixing in songs such as `` trailer park jesus '' and `` must 've run all day '' which give the album a slower , eased pace , without downtrodding the whole album with dismell dispair.I HIGHLY recomend listneing to previoius GJ first then pick this up , but also dont run away because of the few reviewers who dwell on principally angry music and are n't open to change . Still a good worth-while release .
 Man , i love Glassjaw . I love W/T , but i must say i like EYEWTKAS better .
 This album is mindblowing . I saw them live recently and trust me , you do not want to miss a Glassjaw show . The band is mindblowing but maintains a realness that I have never experienced from any other band .
 When I heard about this thing coming out in July 9th , 2002 ... I was so hyped . I expected it to be an amazing and incredibly written album ... was I right?God yes , I was instantly drawn in when I first heard `` Tip your bartender '' ... such emotion and I am so proud of how much Daryl and the rest of the band has grown up . You can definitely tell it from this album . Most people do not like the album because it went past the stage of Everything you ever wanted to know about silence . But I 'm glad about that because it shows that anger can not be used all the time . One of my favorites on this album is `` The Gillette Cavalcade of sports '' because of the chorus , which goes
 This is a very good album . It took me a few listens to get into it , but now I find myself listening to the album in its entirety 15 to 20 a day .
 I liked EYEWTKAS not for the lyrics -LRB- which I actually thought were sub-par -RRB- , but for the interesting musical soundscapes the rest of the band created . This CD is even better in that sense . From the first five seconds , in which a guitar riff moves from one speaker to another , you know that you are in for a musical odyssey of heavy riffs , frantic drumming , and frequent change within songs , a journey that increasingly few bands can take you on nowadays . Probably the best description of this work would be `` Dillinger Escape Plan goes emo . '' If you like complex , intense rock with frequent tempo changes , get this CD right now . The only songs I do n't like are `` Cosmopolitan Bloodloss '' and `` Ape Dos Mil , '' the first two singles . Oh well , maybe they 'll get some emo kids to stop listening to their other music ... and get some taste .
 Well , first off , I just want to say that I do n't have the first album -LRB- Everything you ever wanted to know about the silence -RRB- , but I will have it soon , so do n't beat the -LSB- stuffing -RSB- out of me , ok Hardcore fans?K.Now , with that out of the way , Let me start by saying that this album is not for someone who listens to a cd , and not like it because it does n't have a certain `` sound '' . This album is a mess.A mess that is neatly piled together on 11 tracks , and if u do n't SERIOUSLY listen to it , this will be u ; wtf?Even when I listened to it the first time , I was a bit dissapointed.But if u keep listening to it , everything comes together.This is n't emo.This is n't nu-metal . This is DIFFERENT.This is the way music should be done.Balls to the wall , do n't give a flying poo kinda attitude , all about the music.If u are tired to seeing the usual dime-a-dozen bands , check these guys out.U wo n't regret it .
 This album is so drastically different from Everything You Ever Needed to Know About Silence , but at the same time it is not . The root of their sound is kept , however the song writing and arrangements are much improved . Along with increased vocal diversity by Daryl Palumbo , and a wall of eratic yet defined guitar . I am glad to see this band break away and emerge itself with its own sound , and stray farther away from a so called `` new york hardcore band . '' From the war-like anthem of Tip Your Bartender and Pink Roses to the intricate guitar weaving and beautifull melodies of Trailer Park Jesus and Two Tabs of Mesculine , Worship and Tribute is indeed an album of timeless and non definable music .
 I bought the last glassjaw cd and I was impressed . I bought their latest and I wet myself . They are so much better this way . I love both cds but this outshines the older one . It is beautiful .
 After hearing this album for the first time , I was both stunned and blown away , not just by the music but how much glassjaw has evolved . They went from angst filled screaming desires to a more positive anger and more flow with the music . Right when this album starts , you will automatically get pulled into the music and whether you like it or not , you will be shown all the capabilites that glassjaw has . From Daryl 's vocals to Larry 's drumming , everything has changed but for the better . It 's amazing just to hear how much Daryl 's voice has changed . This album is definitely not a disappointment and I have had it in my stereo everyday since I 've got it . It 's impossible to put down and hopefully their next album will be the same way . Great job guys .
 At first , yeah , we were all a bit dissappointed . Let 's not kid ourselves . It 's not as heavy . But within time , this album is right up there with EYEWTKAS .
 I was super hyped on this cd , and i also bought this on the day it came out all those years ago . I dont like it as much as the first cd , but its still miles ahead of the crap thats being released these days.The album is a lot more tame than before , and unfortunately a few songs are a bit too repetitive -LRB- like Must 've Run All Day -RRB- . There are still amazing songs on this though.A lot of the tracks have a lot more singing , and the singing is improved . I dont know how people could compare Daryl to Chino though . Chino is one of the most horrid singers ever in my opinion , and Deftones were the absolute WORST band i ever paid to see.Some tracks on here seem to try to create the anger of EYEWTKAS but fail . Stuck Pig seems completely out of place on this cd and Two Tabs Of Mescaline is ok but not as good as i think it could have been.Standout tracks on here are Mu Empure , Ape Dos Mil , The Gillette Cavalcade Of Sports and my personal favorite Radio Cambodia.Lots of bands change their style now when they release new albums and almost all of them fall flat on their faces . To see how to change without selling out and completely sucking , check this cd out .
 If there is any one band that has gotten more support in the underground than anyone else , that band would be GlassJAw . Even before the release of their major label debut Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Silence they had met unthinkable support in the scene . On this , their sophomore effort , GlassJAw has n't let down the masses and has created an infectuous album which is undoubtably going to go down as one of the best releases in recent years and most likely bring the band 1,000 's of new fans.Once again the lyrical styles of Daryl define the sound of the group . Instantly recognizable , his vocals are the rawest and purest that you will ever hear . Totally unaltered his screams rip a massive cavity in your chest and pack it full of anguish and devestation , flinging you up and spinning you through the entire gamut of emotions before slamming you back down in a flurry of rage . However , this time around Daryl tries something new as well . On Worship for every gut wrenching scream there is an addicting line of singing vocals , displaying just how deep Daryl 's abilities go . Ape Dos Mil , which should have gotten a lot more airplay than it did -LRB- blame the labels -RRB- , is a great example of this . Not once during the tracks 5:02 duration does he unleash his screams , but instead maintains a highly unique singing style the entire time . It 's very infecting and manages to alter the sound of the band without leaving you with the feeling that they have ventured too far from the mold.The music itself remains similiar to past effots but does undergo little changes . There is a greater emphasis on the musical contest of the tracks as opposed to the vocals as before and while the music maintains the same sound as it has in the past , it also finds time to slow down from time to time . The different layers that can be created with the abilities of two guitar players opens a lot of doors for the band musically , and this becomes apparent as the bands experimentation brings about many unorthodox riffs and sounds that sometimes seem random and unorganized , but still manage to create a perfect plane for Daryl to track his vocals on.It has been a time of evolution for GlassJAw in both their music and their lives . With their recent label war still looming overhead , and the pressures of following up possibly the most successful album in history of the indie scene , there have been many barriers for the band to overcome . But they do so with devestating results , creating an album which will re-define a genre and solidifies their position as a band for the ages . A band which will continue to spawn countless immitation acts , none of which will be able to truly capture the unique sound that inspires them . Worship and Tribute will go down as a classic and belongs in everyone 's cd library .
 First off I would like to give a big thumbs down to all of you former glassjaw fans that just can not accept change . Glassjaw has changed , no wait , glassjaw has grown ... and how beautifully they have matured.Glassjaw 's follow up to their debut EYEWTKAS , is ... simply , amazing ! They have shown so much musical improvement , so much more depth and creativity ... With songs ranging from the catchy yet heavy Tip Your Bartender to the ever-so-melodic rythms of Ape Dos Mil and Must Have Run All Day -LRB- listen to this song oh man its amazing , expecially the ending ! -RRB- . This whole album is amazing and is a great listen but its best moments are in the path leading up to the finale ... Calvacade , Trailer Park Jesus , and of course ... Two Tabs of Mescaline . So ambient and beautiful yet you can feel the energy in Palumbos gorgeous vocal chords , it makes me want to scream.Glassjaw is a gift sent down from the greater power just for our sheer enjoyment , and damnit , thank you so much.Buy this with The Mars Volta - de loused in the comatorium . go , now , treat yourself to some genious .
 I did n't know what to think after my first listen to this CD . I had just gotten into Glassjaw a few months prior , so WT was quite a departure from EYEWTKAS . After a few more listens , it all clicked and I was able to really hear the growth this band went through and the talent they truly posses . Daryl does n't scream as much , but when he does ... it is priceless . Daryl also matured in the lyric department as well . The guitar work is much more intricate on this album . I 've actually listened to this album while turing my balance control to hear the two guitar parts during each part of a song . Absolutly amazing . My personal favorites include Mu Empire , Pink Roses , Trailer Park Jesus , and Two Tabs of Mescaline . I was able to download Convectuoso , and that song is a masterpiece . Too bad it 's not on the actual CD . Anyway , it 's a great cd that 's well worth your time and money .
 Worship and Tribute charges through tracks not knowing who or what is left behind . Those who are left remain in awe in the wakes of this album . GlassJaw is fueled by love , anger , heart , passion , and obsession . Read the lyrics to `` Ape Dos Mil '' to understand my reasoning for saying obsession . However , GlassJaw boldly delves into their peronal originality and musicaly diverse ideas.Worship and Tribute is indeed a must have for those who want to experience the future of alternative/punk/screamo or what have you . Personally I am not a fan of new alt . rock but GlassJaw has certainly lit a match amongst musical exploration . Unfortunatley I could not give it a full five due to some of the instrumentals . On some tracks like `` Cosmopolitan Bloodloss '' they add certain guitar noises or feedback that kind of ruin the song . There are many other creative ways to add loud noise then just wailing guitars . Overall , this is a great album , however it is not flawless . Highlights include Ape Dos Mil in which Daryl Palumbo takes you into his personal demons and Trailer Park Jesus in which I think is a flawless song . GlassJaw is certainly a talent to watch out for in the next few years . Those who want inevitably different music , turn to GlassJaw ... Worship and Tribute is indeed a superb musical achievement .
 The raw emotional energy that emanates from this album is incredible . Every song is a outpouring of Palumbo 's heart and soul in his lyrics and singing . The musicianship on this album is stunning as well . The pure hardcore punk jams are intense and complex especially on the opening song `` Tip Your Bartender '' and the closing song `` Convectuoso '' along with `` Mu Empire '' and `` Radio Cambodia . '' `` Stuck Pig '' is a hard hitting , wailing almost metal song that is surprisingly catchy . The song `` Must 've Run All Day '' is a haunting , but beautiful trip that rings with sincere emotion . The song `` Cavalcade '' is memorable because of the sportscasting done by Palumbo at the end of the song . Sort of lyrical experimentation . Worship and Tribute is a superb album that is right up there with The Used 's amazing debut in my book . Excellent vocals and musicianship with a sound that is completely their own . Hard to beat an album this good .
 Following the incendiary and emotionally powerful debut album , this album is more of an emo affair , than straight hate . The first single from Worship and Tribute `` Cosmopolitan Bloodloss '' is absolutely stunning , a mixture of pummelling riffs and off-kilter melodies , with daryl palumbos soothing emotion provoking vocal talents.Also check out the gently lulling `` ape dos mil '' and the scratchy wah-wah schizophrenia of `` tip your bartender '' . Initial import copies have an enhanced feature for alimited availability which will probably feature the video to `` cosmopolitan bloodloss '' which was no. 1 handpicked video at Mtv.com at this time of writing , and some live footage for a video for `` ape dos mil '' which is tipped to be the next single , and the video to `` must 've run all day '' . If you liked songs from Everything you allways wanted to know about silence , like `` piano '' , `` boom '' and `` majour '' you 'll love this album , there is plenty of heaviness and some of the most amazing riffs ever . This is probably this summers most anticipated album for me .
 Well , here it is , finally ... Worship and Tribute , i cant beliveit.This morning i woke up at 8:30 just so i could be there when Best Buy opened to get my copy of W/T . At first , the packaging kinda confused me but then i realized how cool and origional it was when i got home . But anyways , i was walking aroud the store with a smile on my face . After i bought it i returned home and popped it in my cd player . i sat . i listened . i was amazed . This CD is very different from EYEWTKAS , however , both are filled with beuty and sincerity . EYEWTKAS was an album revolving around the hate of love , W/T seems to revolve around problems in society and everyday hurt . Daryl has definatly grown as a lyricist with some of the most wit filled i have seen ... ever . The only 2 songs -LRB- because both albums are very different -RRB- that i would relate to EYEWTKAS are Tip Your Bartender , which takes a trip back into the hardcore sound that made up most of EYEWTKAS . Second is Radio Cambodia which reminds me of Ry Ry 's song , bringing a more punkish feel to the cd.You could get lost trying to chase the guitars in this album . They are just everywhere . Both Todd and Beck bring them together to make a sound that no other band brings to the table . The new bassist doesnt effect me that much seeing as how the bass wasnt that evident on EYEWTKAS , but he does a good job on the slower songs . The druming is top notch and goes perfectly with the songs . W/T has strange time changes and guitar `` noises '' a plenty , which brings a prog feel to the album . Lastly , i wouldnt say that Dayrl has grown as a vocalist cause i think he had this melody in him all along , he just chose to show more of it on this album.This album proves that GlassJAw are the true leaders of emocore and most other emo bands , nothing sounds like them , no one could sound like them , and this album proves it . This album really is untouchable -LRB- no pun intended -RRB-
 This album is definitely a masterpiece . I am , by far , not a huge fan of hardcore music . But , how can you deny such great music ? Far from being compared to any in its class , Glassjaw have made me a believer . Worship and Tribute is an album that surely shows a great maturity of the band . Though considerably not near as `` heavy '' as '' ... Silence '' , there 's great reason . Much of `` EYWTKAS '' was based on love or lack of love 's returns.Love has made me scream over and over again , but eventually , we all get over it . That 's what has happened on W & T . As stated in the albums first track ` Tip Your Bartender ' , `` Not throwing stones at you anymore '' , lyricist Daryl Palumbo puts that behind him and starts over.The more mellow feeling album shows pure talent from all five musicians . I was suckered into the greatness of this recording by the beautiful sounds of `` Ape Dos Mil '' and `` Must 've Run All Day '' . I shortly found myself loving the entire album as a whole . Beautiful transitions from track to track and a very strong finishing four songs make it very hard for me to believe there are nay-sayers to W & T. My favorite strongpoint is the song `` Radio Cambodia '' , a strong , angry disapproval of how wars are fueled . There is no limit on creativity , Glassjaw proves it.Like other reviews suggest , please allow yourself to listen to the album from beginning to end a couple of times . If this review does n't do it for you , go see them live ... and dont wear your glasses . Enjoy !
 One of the best albums ever . Definitely the best of 2002 . Listen to `` Trailer Park Jesus '' and got lost in it 's perfection !! Get this album if you like music !!
 This is Glassjaw 's second album * major label debut from Warner Bros. * which looks as Glassjaw has grown up a little on the music * not as much chaos as EYEWTKAS * but still great Tip Your Bartender and Mu Empire starts this album with a BANG ! I Just love Daryl Palumbo screaming at the end of Tip Your Bartender `` BUY IT LOAD IT SHOOT IT ! '' which proves Glassjaw still has some Anger in them . Ape Dos Mil and Must 've run All Day are my two favorite slow Glassjaw Song 's on this album , Real Glassjaw fan 's will not be upset by this Album
 If your into this kind of music then BUY THIS NOW . Although its not as hard as their first its still really good.Thay even have a good live show I saw them in June at the Warped tour.Good lyrics too .
 Ah glassjaw . Glassjaw has released a great cd with Worship And Tribute . I admit , it took me a few listens to fully appreciate this album , and rightfully so , many great albums take time to enjoy to the fullest . The album starts off great with the opening strumming of distorted chords of Tip Your Bartender . It 's all gold from there , right up to Two Tabs Of Mescaline . Buy it if you have an open mind and want to see Glassjaw 's take on hardcore .
 Gj brings you nothing but some good melodic lay back feel and even tho these guys are not near being heavy ? they still get good review from me ! I fell in love with gj ever since '' everything you ever wanted to be about silence '' since then ? I just ca n't help but to support these genious ! I prefer listing to glassjaw 's `` worship & tribute '' right after i get off the bathroom and lay on my couch and relax to this soothing sound by gj and only gj can bring ! Support these talent musicians !! Laters !!!
 There 's nothing more that can honestly be said about Worship and Tribute . After listening to EYEWTKAS and falling in love with the power of Darryl 's voice and the overwhelming guitar sound , I picked up Worship when it came out . On first listen you 'll try and figure it out , but you wo n't actually get it until about the 4th or 5th listen . Glassjaw is a very talented band and I think a leader of the way rock is evolving . In a time where I find it very hard to actually call a band original , Glassjaw are easily a truly original band and deserve every bit of limelight they recieve . Bottom line pick it up give it a listen and you wo n't be dissapointed .
 this is an awesome disc ... i enjoy every second of this disc . . not much more can be said it has changed my view on music in general , im goin to snocore friday , and i cant wait ...
 Glassjaw is the best band out there and my favorite !!! Glassjaw 's `` worship & tribute '' has 12 well done songs and i still enjoy them all ... Especialy `` mu empire '' , `` pink roses '' , and the song that i think sounds alot like at the drive-in which is , `` tip your bartenter '' that song rimended me alot of at the drive-in !! Over-all ? an awsome album that i cherish because its that good !!! Laters !
 at first listen , i was only impressed by cosmopolitan blood loss . but after listening to the whole cd a few times in my friends car i realized that this album had a lot more depth than i gave it credit for . in my opinion some of the stand out songs on this record are ape dos mil and cosmo blood loss . but each song has something to offer . you 're not just going to get an annoying flow of screams throughout each song . there 's a nice variance between the deep screaming and the switch to passionate singing which makes each song stand out . i would definately grab this album if you 're fans of finch and the used . its worth your time .
 I do n't know about the rest of you out there but I really appreciate music that is played well with amazingly vocals . Daryll manages so exhibit his amazing vocals very well on this album . He has a very unique singing style but thats not a bad thing . Sure its not your everyday emo core , but hey , you ca n't denie it just because its different . This is a very talented band indeed.Not only are the vocals and lyrics great but the music is amazing as well . Though not as hard as their earlier release , `` Everything you Ever Wanted to Know About Silence '' its still a classic in my book . Daryll does alot more singing on Worship and Tribute than he does in EYEWKAS . But anyways , this is supposed to be about the music . The songs can remain soft and yet still keep their edge which is seen in their earlier work.The bottom line here is this is a great cd coming from a great band . The have alot of talent and you can tell from their work . I really look forward to their next album , I hope most of you can accept the change between earlier and glassjaw and this but I can live with it . `` Sometimes we struggle to improve conditions just for the right to say `` We improved conditions .

 The first of the LPs on this CD was recorded in 1956 with Vic Damone fresh from his success in Kismet . This was Vic 's first album for his new label , Columbia , for whom he had signed the previous year . They teamed him up with the orchestra of Tutti Camarata and recorded the ensemble in ` hi-fidelity ' mono sound . So if your ears are now tuned to crisp digital sound you may be disappointed . For me , the singing and arrangement are all , so while digital would have been better , I 'm just happy to have this LP on CD to enjoy
 The first three Tears For Fears albums are all quintessential 80 's pop . That is to say , the singles are phenomenal , the album tracks have cool synth experimentation , but there are a few slow spots on each disc . `` The Hurting '' is almost like a therapy session on record . Some of the lyrics may be a little too introspective , but the hooks more than make up for it . Mad World is an amazing song -LRB- follow it up with great cover version in `` Donnie Darko '' -RRB- and Pale Shelter remains a sturdy single . `` Songs From the Big Chair '' contains this group 's biggest hits . Shout is almost like an ode to primal scream therapy , and Everybody Wants to Rule the World may be the best single of the entire decade . Head Over Heels turns out to be part of a pretty cool song suite . There is no filler on this album with the possible exception of track 8 -LRB- the instumental last track of the original album which just does n't really seem to go anywhere -RRB- . `` The Seeds of Love '' start to drop the synth-pop vibe for more Beatles-like sounds and late 80 's pop values -LRB- which these guys actually do quite well -RRB- . The title track and Woman In Chains are the singles here , but my favorite is Standing On The Corner Of The Third World , featuring Manu Katche on drums and some really cool worldbeat sounds.The packaging on this set is a bit of a problem . The CD 's seem to have trouble holding in their spots , and I had to exchange this set because of strange warping on the second disc . My next copy still had a few strange warped marks on it , but at least it plays ok . Additionaly , while you do get the CD booklets , this set leaves out the back covers . This unfortunately makes putting these discs in normal CD cases less desirable , as well as robbing the owner of the back cover art . Still , this is a pretty cheap way of getting these albums remastered with bonus tracks -LRB- as separate purchases it would cost $ 45-60 -RRB- .
 Excellent set of the best work of Tears for Fears . I also found the package has started to break down , with the glue failing on the box . Buy the disks , find a 3 disk jewel case and replace the box . You will not be disappointed by the content .
 Ralph Moore has worked with Bobby Hutcherson , JJ Johnson , Cedar Walton , and Freddie Hubbard . Here he has an album of modern post-bop jazz that features a couple of Moore original tunes -LRB- Freeway , Blues For John -RRB- . There are some works by a couple of major sax players , This I Dig of You -LRB- Hank Mobley -RRB- and Punjab -LRB- Joe Henderson -RRB- . My favorites are `` Freeway '' , `` Morning Star '' , and `` Episode From A Village Dance '' -LRB- by Donald Brown -RRB- . Moore is accompanied by Terrence Blanchard along with Benny Green , Peter Washington and Kenny Washington . These side men all seem to have gone have gone on to greater careers than Moore , but this albums really cooks .
 As the last bark from the original Black Dog line-up , the Peel Sessions adds five last bites to their legacy . `` Shinehead '' has the smooth production value that we 'd expect , with a quiet , shuffling grace , while `` Rise Up '' has that skewed melodic quality that we know and love . `` Simperton '' is not quite as realized as the other tracks , but `` Rue '' and `` Psycosyin '' -LRB- the latter would appear in a different form on Spanners -RRB- , cement why The Black Dog was and will always be some of the best electronic music ever programmed .
 i would just like to mention , for any body who may be comtemplating this CD that it totally kicks *** . It has all the classic Black Dog atmospheere of BYTES and especially THE TEMPLE OF TRANSPARANT BALLS , in my opinion this cd is an essential part of any BLACK DOG collection.The first track is SUUUUPERB!P.S dont buy MUSIC FOR ADVERTS ...
 I like `` Off Course '' more than any other band I have listened to , and I have nearly every one of their CD 's . I really do like this CD set a lot , but even though I like it , I am a bit disappointed at the same time . Why ? Well , the main reason is because that I highly disagree with the producers of this CD that this is their `` ALL TIME '' best collection!What really bugs me is the fact that most of the songs are from the 1970 's through early 1980 's . A lot of their good songs are from that time period , but seriously , most of their greatest hits of all time came in the mid/late 1980 's . The only mid/late 1980 's songs that are on here are
 27 years , have I 've been spinning this album . I 've went through three vinyl copies & have a Japanese import CD , now I also have a double album CD which `` Heat in the Street '' is also included . It maybe redundant at this point to say that `` Putting it Straight '' is not just my favorite PT album , but my favorite album of all time ! It still sounds as everybit fresh today as the day I popped it on my record player , so many years ago . `` Putting it Straight '' starts off with the speeding mammoth , shiny metallic freight train that is `` Life in London . '' PT 's last word on the punk scene that was consuming London at the time . Fast , hard , & metallic , `` Life in London '' is a juggernaut stomping on the lifeless corpse that punk would be in a couple of years . The second & third songs , `` It Aint What it Seems '' & `` Speakeasy , '' are rollicking guitar riff driven tunes that speak of goodtimes & bad . `` Running from the Future '' -LRB- my favorite song off the album -RRB- is a monster of Jazzy metal heaviness with guitar breaks that bring tears to my eyes . The sound he gets out of his guitar is just incredible on this song & the album as a whole , truely unique . `` Running from the Future 's '' subject is also as forboding as it is heavy . PT speaking of his drug use , knowing it will lead to nowhere . `` Lovin ' You '' is a keyboard driven song of love & regret . The funky instrumental `` Off Beat Ride '' demonstrates PT 's fusion side not unlike Jeff Beck 's `` Wired , '' it also shows PT 's considerable keyboard talents . The giant funky metallic riffery & time changes of `` Gettin ' Betta '' is a immortal PT classic . It draws you in like a set of white water rapids , full of bumps & grinds , you have to hang on ! The last song , `` Dedication '' is gorgeous . It 's melody takes you away . It 's lryics about friendship & kindness are truly heart-felt & warm . There is no doubt that PT knows how to write important personal songs of life & how to live it , a masterpiece.This is the last album to feature the tremendous drumming of future Iron Maiden drummer Niko McBrain . Next would be Tommy Aldridge ! 5/5
 I bought this album upon it 's release in 1977 . This is undoubtly his best effort . I saw Pat Travers in 1977 at Will Rogers auditorium in Fort Worth Texas . This is a small venue that holds about 4000 people and he blew the roof off this place . So glad to see it finally released on CD . This album is unlike Radio Active or Heat In The Street and has not aged one bit . It is more funked up with a touch of jazz to it . There is not one bad track on it . If you do n't have this cd GET IT ! You will not be sorry .
 I agree with others here that this is probably Pat Traver 's best effort . Just wanted to mention that on my copy of this disc the songs are in a completely different order than they are coded on the disc . The disc is coded in the order the songs appear on the cover , but this is not the actual song order on the disc . Be aware that if you rip this disc to your computer you will have to manually rename the files to . . ahem ... `` Put them straight '' . Actual song order on the disc = How the disc is coded :01 Life in London = Life in London02 It Ai n't What It Seems = Gettin ' Betta03 Speakeasy = Runnin ' from the Future04 Runnin ' from the Future = It Ai n't what it Seems05 Lovin ' You = Off Beat Ride06 Off Beat Ride = Lovin ' You07 Gettin ' Betta = Dedication08 Dedication = SpeakeasyKind of sloppy execution , if you ask me . Oh well , still a great disc . Buy it !
 Pat Travers `` Putting It Straight '' is one CD that needs to be in everyGuitarist and wan na be ! collection . Pat 's music is versatile and energydriven ! This CD kicks ASS ! and you still ca n't play it loud enough , even at 34 years old.BUY IT ! you wo n't be disappointed !
 I put this in the CD player for the ride to work this morning and cranked it up . Just what I needed to get going today . This is a classic ! ... and the drums , they 're like a lead instrument on a couple of cuts . Never get tired of thsi one .
 Came across this album back in 1977 when I was traveling alot . To think that there was a guitarist that could play like this with this style and complexity was literally unheard of back then . This album kept me amazed for years to come and am thrilled to find it again here on Amazon . Now I 'm amazed all over again !
 This one of Pat 's best albums.this album features the line-up of Pat Travers , Mars Cowling , Nico McBrain -LRB- Nico left after this album to join Iron Maiden -RRB- . This disc features some of Pat 's best work , stong guitar work , killer drumming and rocking tunes.The draw back to the cd is the remastering of the lp has the songs out if sequence.The Titles are right but the songs do n't match.This is not a one time fluke , i have bought 2 different copies from 2 different places and they are both out of sequence.Dosn ' t effect the music though , this is a rocking cd .
 I had not listened to this album in years , then I get the CD and man - o - man ! Every song is solid and Pat really showcases his ability to weave into different rhythms then back again in the same song . Great guitar work . The definitive CD to have in a PT collection . Sound quality , not the best , but worth it .
 This one has it all . All of the instrumentalists are firing on all cylinders . The songwriting is very original and the liberal use of altered chords in a mostly hard rock context is mind-blowing . You can hear unlikely influences from Average White Band -LRB- Off Beat Ride -RRB- , Camel -LRB- you have to really know Camel to hear this -RRB- , BeBop Deluxe -LRB- listen to Axe Victim and then the lead guitar on Dedication -RRB- , and jazz and blues in general . By far Pat 's best album . On my short list of best albums . Repeat after me ... you must buy this ... you must buy this ...

 I think this one is more Bluesy then others , I like it though ! It has good hard licks and has a sound that can be appreciated for it 's guitaring and voice ! You ca n't go wrong with Pat on this One !
 Bought it many years ago on vinyl and still have it ! Had to buy it it again in a more modern format.Simply one of my all time favorite albums . Pat is one of the most under rated guitar players out there . If you purchase this , you wo n't be sorry .
 Great guitar licks thru out the album , This came out in the late 1970 's but sounds still great today . Great musician who never really got his dues .
 I been looking for this one for years or more like decades ! Forgot how good that raw guitar scream was thanks Amazom for putting this out there !
 Had the vinyl years ago , now I have added a must have cd to my collection .
 The album sequence of tracks is the way they should be . In the 70 's the PT band was one of the tightest rock shows around . I saw them in 83at a SMALL club in Santa Cruz . 105 people packed in . Three piece and did n't miss a beat . Of the 100 's of shows I 've seen that was a top 5 .
 There were a lot of guitar gods rolling around in the early to mid seventies , a lot of talent , some of which did n't get much airplay in America
 I recently bought this CD after listening to cassette copies that I made off the original LP for many years . After wearing out both the record and the Cassette -LRB- s -RRB- I was thrilled to see it re-released on CD . I have seen PT several times live and have always thought this was his best stuff . I played guitar in a rock band during the late seventies and Pat 's tunes were a refreshing addition to our set lists . We just loved jamming on `` Gettin ' Betta '' , `` Life in London '' , and other Pat Travers songs . He is truly one of the great all-time rockers and IMHO this is his best . Every track is great!As an aside , I have great seats to see him at our local venue here in Annapolis , MD -LRB- Ram 's Head Tavern -RRB- on November 28 , 2005 . I will be about 20 feet from the stage and ca n't wait !
 PUTTING IT STRAIGHT is a great album by Pat Travers , blending the hard rock of Mountain , Montrose , ZZ Top , and Foghat , the Southern rock of the Allman Brothers Band , Lynyrd Skynyrd , the Marshall Tucker Band , and the Outlaws , and the vintage R&B of Booker T. & The MGs , thus setting the stage for the R&B - metal fusion of Living Colour and the 90s rap-metal explosion . There are many great songs here , especially `` Life In London '' , `` It Ai n't What It Seems '' -LRB- a warning against trusting what you know little about -RRB- , `` Gettin ' Betta '' , `` Loving You '' , `` Running From The Future '' , and `` Dedication -LRB- Parts 1 & 2 -RRB- . '' This CD is a must for any fan of funky , blues-based rock & roll .
 For anyone looking for an intro to the music of Neil Sedaka , this is the place to get started . You get all of his big hits including `` Next Door To An Angel '' , `` Breaking Up Is Hard To Do '' as well as the hilarious `` Run , Samson , Run '' . Sound quality is good , though I really feel a bit better job could 've been done -LRB- it does sound a bit harsh -RRB- . The only other gripe is no inclusion of the original liner notes or original liner art . BMG says the album started appearing in the 1970 's with a picture from that time period , but I beg to differ as this was issued in the mid-60 's originally . But , the music is great !!!!
 I 'm 17 years old and along with Bob Marley and Thin Lizzy , Neil is my favourite singer . This is a great album -- his '60s stuff was definitely the best . He 's got a voice that sounds like he 's always smiling and his songs are so happy and infectiously poppy . Get this album , it 's CLASSIC Neil , and all the songs are good .
 Here they are , the songs you think of when you think of Neil Sedaka . Get the lyrics from the internet , print them out , grab some kids , and have a sing along . These are very peppy , singable songs for all to enjoy . It will be a real treat .
 SEDAKA IS GREAT . ALL OF HIS SONGS MEAN SO MUCH . HE REALLY SINGS HIS WAY STRAIGHT TO YOUR HEART .
 Includes MANY of Neil 's TOP hits !!! If you LOVE Neil Sedaka -LRB- or 50 's & 60 's Oldies but Goodies -RRB- , this is a GREAT selection !!!

 Neil Sedaka Sings His Greatest Hits has 12 huge , huge hits that made Neil Sedaka a household name even early on in his career . These songs still sound every bit as good today as they did when they were originally released all those years ago . Neil cares a lot about putting out high quality control music ; you can tell how much he loves his music by listening to his enthusiasm as he performs these numbers . The only caveat I can think of is that because this album was released in 1962 on vinyl , any songs of Neil 's that you may like that were released after 1962 wo n't be on this CD . However , what we do get is so good this album is still practically a must-have for any Neil Sedaka fan -- and it 's a great starter CD for people just discovering his singular talent . The quality of the sound on this CD is excellent and the artwork is very well done.The album begins with Neil doing a rousing ballad , `` Next Door To An Angel . '' This adorable song is infectiously catchy and Neil never sounded better -- wow ! This is a song that almost anyone can relate to ; we can all remember `` awaking '' one day to `` discover '' that someone we knew all of a sudden is so attractive ! Great ! `` Oh , Carol '' is another very romantic number with just a hint of a Latin flavor added to the music ; the music perfectly complements Neil 's vocals as he sings this faultlessly . `` Oh , Carol '' is indeed a major highlight of this fine album . `` King Of Clowns '' is a song I have n't heard as much as some of the others ; but it 's very good and Neil bats this straight out of the ballpark ! `` Stairway To Heaven '' could n't be any better ; Neil sings this passionately and he never misses a beat , either ! In addition , there 's `` Calendar Girl ; '' this tune is one of my very favorite Neil Sedaka tunes of all time . Neil sings this wonderfully and the backup singers harmonize to perfection -- not that Neil needed backup , but they do sound pretty good anyway . I love it . `` Breaking Up Is Hard To Do '' gives us the faster version from Neil ; and he performs this without letting go of a single superfluous note ! The music uses the percussion very well and Neil 's excellent diction bolsters his performance all the more . `` Breaking Up Is Hard To Do '' has a late 1950s flavor to it ; and it all holds its own very well . `` Happy Birthday , Sweet Sixteen '' is another one of Neil 's best hits ever ; I always loved this number and Neil delivers it with his usual grace and positive energy . `` Happy Birthday , Sweet Sixteen '' is another number that uses the percussion very well . `` Little Devil '' is an excellent number that you 're bound to remember if you have n't heard this one already . `` Little Devil '' is very creative as Neil sings of the girl he wants to be his own ; and the arrangement is nothing short of perfect . The album also ends well with Neil Sedaka performing `` You Mean Everything To Me . '' This ballad has a slower beat than most on this CD but it sounds every bit as beautiful ; the strings sound great and Neil is squarely front and center -- right where he belongs!Neil Sedaka Sings His Greatest Hits truly is a fun CD that any Neil Sedaka fan should own . It 's particularly useful as a starter CD for new fans . These tunes are timeless ; they will never go out of style and that 's grand.Great job , Neil ! Thank you for everything you 've given us !
 11 of 12 songs are classic as I remember Sedaka . CD sound is good and has high level of intensity . CD is a joy to listen to !
 This is a GREAT CD , wished I had ordered two ! One for home and one for the car .
 These are the romantic songs I grew up with and that is why I bought this CD . If you need a `` shot '' in the romance department , one or more of these songs should do it .
 Great music which helped us to know more tunes since we got to see him in concert . It arrived in excellent condition .
 Love the old songs . Neil Sedaka is a favorite & he sings & writes so very well . Great collection of his tunes .
 Neil Sedaka is one of my all time favorite artists . The songs on this CD are wonderful . I will enjoy listening to this CD over and over for years to come . Great to have in the car for long trips .
 Being a longtime Neil Sedaka fan -LRB- especially `` Breaking Up Is Hard to do '' and `` Calendar Girl '' ... I grew to love all of his music . Saw him in concert in the early 90 's in CA and he was still on top of his game . Never gets old ... brings back the days of my youth and I can remember everything that I did in my life during those songs ... great memories of the old days when music was truly `` music '' .
 The CD is clear and crisp.The only reason I gave it 4 stars was I did not care for some of the songs . I did buy it for certain songs so I should n't complain . The price is right so you really ca n't go wrong .
 This is a fun CD because it includes all of Neil Sedaka 's big hits from the late 50 's early 60 's .
 We love the CD it is an Oldie but Goody for us . I takes us back to those good old days .
 This is true Sedaka in his ORIGINAL form - it was a long search to find his hits from original recordings as opposed to re-records done more recently . If you love the Sedaka sound of the 60 's , this is it .
 I 've got this CD version of Neil 's 1962 LP on the computer as I type this review . I also have my original RCA Victor LP of the same ` Greatest Hits . ' This is a great recording in any form . Every song is a gem . I remember playing this LP in early 1963 and really enjoying it . I 'm obviously enjoying the CD today as well . Neil in in great voice and the recording is of really high quality . My favorite tracks are ` Breaking Up Is Hard To Do ' , ` Oh Carol ' , ` Little Devil ' and ` Calendar Girl ' . One reviewer said that the CD sound was ` somewhat harsh ' . I do n't think so . The CD sound compares favorably with the LP . The reason I bought the CD is that I ca n't tolerate even little pops and ticks on old LPs if I can get a clean copy on CD ! This CD is inexpensive and I recommend it highly .
 Richard Hawley is one of the great song-writers . This single version of `` Born Under a Bad Sign '' is a gem , featuring a great bridge in which his lead guitarist uses a Burns 12 stringed guitar , as he used recently at the Knitting Factory in Hollywood , a great place to see any alternative rock show -LRB- March , 2006 -RRB- . Hawley also plays a great bridge piece on his red Gretsch -LRB- I think it was a Gretsch -RRB- . The non-LP `` Dark Road '' increases this new CD single 's appeal . And you get the video , only it should be noted that it is a Region 2 DVD and does n't play on American Region 1 DVD players . But do n't let that stop you ! The single version of `` Born Under a Bad Sign '' and `` Dark Road '' are worth the small price of this new Richard Hawley CD single .
 Pablo Moses , the man with a revolutionary dream , brings out his best voice and songs in here . This cd showcases the singles made by Pablo in the beginings of the 70 's decade . A must have for roots fans , filled with gems like I man a grasshoper , give I fe I name and the tittle track .
 delicious , gentle , rootsy reggae . 6 of the 11 cuts are pop masterpieces with addictive hooks . all of the other cuts are strong musically as well . all of the cuts are full of a heartfelt philosophy that opposes injustice , but does not react violently which only leads to more violence . poetic lyrics discuss such things as being enlightened and living in a backward society -LRB- i.e. , geedy , violent , ignorant , such as most capitalist countries and many non-capitalist ones -RRB- ; smoking `` collie weed '' and being reported to the police instead of being left alone to enjoy ; the corrupt man , although rich , has a ghetto soul ; how the rich pay the poor to kill other poor to help the rich stay in power ; how jamaican and other blacks have been given European names and robbed of their African identities ; how love is the only answer . a wonderful album by any measure that i have played regularly for twenty years .
 Get it ! No question . Not as good as `` A Song '' but an extremely fulfilling album.If you find `` A Song '' on CD , let me know , please?BlessKhader
 Barenboim takes the helm for an incredible look at Tchaikovsky 's 6th and Beethoven 's Piano Sonata No. 8 . These works , linked by their shared subtitle `` Pathetique '' , find a surprisingly comfortable place side by side.Barenboim starts at the piano , and his approach to the Beethoven is smooth and relaxed . So many pianists , when confronted with the `` Pathetique '' , pound away , believing probably that the music needs real aggressiveness and certainly that it can be difficult to keep up with the fast tempo they feel necessary to create the aggressiveness . Our hero , however , knows otherwise . The result is a moving , exciting approach to a piece that frequently gets the rushed , underconsidered `` classical warhorse '' treatment.Tchaikovsky 's B minor symphony is another piece that is performed frequently , and whose performances frequently are identical , fluffy and overwrought . Barenboim 's fresh approach to the score , however , means the tempos are considered with regard to the score itself , not everyone else 's performance.I have conducted the Sixth with a pick-up orchestra , heard it several times in concert and a hundred times on record , and studied the score with devotion . Daniel Barenboim and the CSO 's performance on this disc is the most exciting , most original version I 've ever encountered .
 I have over 30 recordings of Symphony Pathetique including Karajan 's all official recordings , Svetlanov/Mravinsky 's deeply Slavic accounts and Furtwangler 's outrageously powerful and gripping 1951 Cairo live recording , but this account by Barenboim has a special place in my collection , for in this live recording , he manages to lift the music above the conventional emotional drama , by creating Brucknerian grandeur and sublimity with careful attention to detail and mastery grasp of ebb and flow in the music.The way he introduces the lyrical second theme and treats it slightly differently with added intensity each time it returns , is a sheer miracle . The climax in the outer movements is not as devastatingly powerful as Karajan 's 70s ' stereo recordings , yet the stark contrast between the overwhelmming force and the profound sense of serenity makes it deeply moving listening experience . The second and third movement is played with real grace and perfect control over the subtle change in tempi.Overall this performance is in the class of it own , just like Furtwangler 's DG version , for its revelatory interpretation and depth of expression . Chicago SO 's playing is simply second to none with their trade mark of glorious and sumptuous sound . Beautifully recorded live in 1998 , Orchestra Hall , Chicago .
 Note
 I often asked myself ; - in God 's creations , why was I not given the talent to put a few musical notes together and make it sound beautiful and moving . Or else , a hammer and a chisel or a paint brush and paint such as the creations of a Michael Angelo etc. to create something that civilization will always remember that I once existed on this planet ? Sad but also true . These talented people were used , abused and died in poverty . But then again , maybe through saddness , pain and hardships and just as a cocoon turns into a pesky caterpilar transforms into a beautiful butterfly
 This two-on-one import features the cover artwork and liner notes from the U.K. versions of these albums.There are minor flaws in the sound . If possible , buy the U.S. versions of these CDs .
 Price , shipping , and delivery are quite fair . Amazon is always on the top . Therefore I 'll continue being customer of Amazon . Thanks again .

 I chose the highest rating because I love the oldies music , music of the 50-60 's time period . It 's my favorite type of music . I recommend this to any baby-boomer and anyone who enjoys the earlier music of rock etc. . It makes me feel young again and brings back such wonderful memories .
 good music was awesome , sound quality not so good but all and all I was very happy . Yes i would recommend it .
 There are several CDs out that have collections of the Chiffon songs . All of the CDs have their big hits like &#34; He 's So Fine &#34; and &#34; One Fine Day &#34; and most of their medium hits like &#34; Up on the Bridge &#34; . Each of the CDs also has some &#34; not so big hits &#34; , which vary with the collection . I like this collection the best . All of the CDs have been digitally remastered , so the sound on all of them is better than the original records .
 Tiny Tim had an encyclopedic knowledge of American popular music from the 1890s to the 1950s , and could sing most anything you asked for right on the spot , with a perfect feel for the song , the era it came from , and the singers who sang it back then . On TV , he was a living , breathing color cartoon . He was instantly recognizable and unforgetable , with his long , curly hair , prominent nose , and that dainty ukelele that was dwarfed by his imposing 6 ' 1 '' frame . His exaggerated politeness -- he called everyone `` Mister '' or `` Miss '' -- was oddly endearing . And then there was his singing voice , absolutely unique , especially when he went into his unearthly falsetto . Americans were charmed by the fabulous old songs he sang , of course . He fit right into the nostalgic vogue for '20s and '30s style pop music that took place in the '60s , as exemplified by `` Winchester Cathedral '' . This 3 CD collection features Tiny Tim 's complete Reprise studio masters and more . It is a limited edition of 3,000 . Disc One features his first album , God Bless Tiny Tim , which is quite wonderful . This album was a big hit back in the day . The disc also features many non-LP singles , as well as a few singles that had been on one of his albums , in a different mix . Most of these singles are also quite good.Disc Two features Tiny 's second and third albums . Album two was titled Tiny Tim 's Second Album , somewhat unimaginatively . This is another terrific album , that unfortunately did n't sell . His third album was a children 's album titled For All My Little Friends . This one did n't sell , either . This is a good album , but not nearly as good as the previous two . This is probably because Richard Perry , the producer of Tiny 's first two albums , was unavailable to produce most of the album . Perry came up with some imaginative arrangements on Tiny 's earlier albums , but Gene Shiveley , who produced most of the children 's album , seemed content to just feature Tiny alone with his ukelele . I should mention that `` The Viper '' , from Tiny 's first album , is repeated here and it 's the same version , not a new recording.Disc Three begins with five previously unreleased masters , plus four radio commercials for Tiny 's first album . These masters are about as good as anything else he recorded for Reprise , so it 's a mystery why they were n't released . The bulk of the disc features many , many demos that Tiny recorded . Most of these demos were recorded as songs considered to possibly be included on his children 's album . Nearly all of them just feature Tiny and his ukelele . These are n't all the demos he recorded for Reprise , a few were left off because there was n't enough room for them.This collection is a most have for any Tiny Tim fan . -LRB- All 3,000 of us ! -RRB-
 This boxed set is a blessing ! While Tiny Tim 's first is a well known classic , his other recordings with the great producer Richard Perry are equally amazing . His version of `` Great Balls Of Fire '' off of his 2nd record is incredible and completely over the top ! And if you like reading , Barry Hansen 's liner notes are wonderful -LRB- what else would you expect from Dr. Demento -RRB- . If you love Tiny , you 'll love this set . And if you have a roommate who does n't love Tiny , this is the perfect collection to bug the hell out them and eventually drive them crazy ! Yeah !
 Tiny Tim was one of the greatest talents of his era but was not appreciated by the general public because he was presented only as a comedy routine with his irritating falsetto voice . On the cds in this set , you can hear him sing in a wonderful baritone register and enjoy one of the greatest ever versions of `` As Time Goes By '' which includes the seldom-heard verse as well as country versions of `` Satiisfied With Life '' and `` Have You Seen My Little Sue ? '' . `` Frisco Flo '' is a Dixieland number with a fantastic jazz band . There are versions of `` I 'm A Lonesome Little Raindrop '' and `` Remember Your Name And Address '' that would have been better in a lower key but one gets the feeling that Tiny felt the need to live up to the expectations of the general audience for the very high and irritating effect .
 The definitive last word on Tiny 's Reprise era ? Not quite , but then , there 's -LRB- alas -RRB- limited appeal in his recordings ... to a point . Conversely , I do n't EVER see Capitol releasing an equivalent box set of Mrs. Miller 's recordings -LRB- Bear Family might take the dare -RRB- for obvious reasons ! As stated in Dr. Demento 's liner notes , he was a unique historian of music from the late 1800s through the 1950s
 You either like him or you find him a curiosity ... but if you like Tiny Tim this a great set . Unfortunately , only 3,000 copies were pressed by Rhino Handmade . I do n't foresee this selling out anytime soon , but this is definitely worth buying if you 're a fan of this genius . Yes , I said `` genius . '' Tiny Tim knew A LOT about music and his love of old music was evident in his recordings and shows.A nice bonus for me was the inclusion of the mono single version of `` Tiptoe Through The Tulips . '' The original album tracks crossfade into each other and it kind of bugged me over the years . The cd maintains the crossfades and original album sequencing , but the included single tracks offer the songs without the crossfades . A minor quibble sure , but what do you expect from someone who would shell out the dough for this set ? = -RRB-
 Well I ca n't add anything to the wonderful reviews below , but I have a piece of advice for anyone who 's looking to buy this ; If you type Tiny Tim on google search , then click the first link that shows up , you 'll be led to Tiny 's Memorial site . If you go to the home page and scroll down , you 'll find an announcement about this collection and a link to Rhino records , where they are selling brand new copies for $ 59.98 . I purchased my copy here for quite a hefty sum , so I feel that all potential buyers ought to know you can get it cheaper .
 Best introduction to the artist of tiny tim.This is one of the best boxset I ever purchased.You get three albums , b sides , few ads and tons of unreleased recordings .107 tracks on 3 cds remastered.Amazing job on the packaging only 3,000 made .
 Many years ago Entertainment Tonight closed their show with a performance by Tiny Tim . It was a country song about lost love and regret but the one line I remember , and has me searching endlessly is , '' ... but if you 're going to leave me , leave me satisfied . `` A little help will be appreciated .
 Great blend of 80 's and 90 's music . Keeps you motivated , High energy ! I like the Techno twists on some of the songs . Great for running on treadmill or riding stationary bike .
 Just received and loaded into my MP3 - This series are perfect for workouts -LRB- but Richard Simmon 's CD 's are great too -RRB-
 Pros
 I have this record and was glad to see if on CD . Big Iron etc. . It 's Great !
 In the great tradition of great classic country music , you get a story from every song . Any lover of the old sounds will enjoy reminescing with this style of music , new listeners will appreciate what real country ballads are all about . Gene Williams Jr. and his `` The Dark Side '' do the same .
 My 4 sisters and I constantly listened to this album -LRB- yes , vinyl ! -RRB- as children , and Marty Robbins was our pretend boyfriend/handsome prince whenever we played . -LRB- We almost re-enacted `` El Paso '' fighting over who got to be Felina . -RRB- I had forgotten about it until I heard `` El Paso '' played at a local fair . My children -LRB- son age 7 and daughter age 5 -RRB- were mesmerized by the song . I still remembered every word , and I ordered the CD for a road trip . My kids listened to it over and over , and I so enjoyed singing along again . Marty is truly the best country music singer/composer of all time . I bet my kids grow up and pass this along to their children .
 If you love `` El Paso '' , then you 'll love this album ! It surely is the best album from an artist who 's had big commercial success on the country and pop charts . Every song on this album gives you the feel of the Old West ; the gunfights as portrayed in a lot of the popular Western movies at that time , the cattle roundups , and the cowboy life . With his tenor to baritone voice , he sings every song with feeling . The great songs include the gunfighter ballads ; `` Big Iron '' , `` Billy The Kid '' , `` Running Gun '' , and the No. 1 epic , `` El Paso '' . Also , the other great songs like the rodeo staple ; `` Strawberry Roan '' , and the great western gospel track ; `` Master 's Call '' . If you asked me what my favorite song was on here , I could n't really pick one , since every song is just as good as the next . This album is the absolute best album of western music out of any other album of western music that there is ! So if you like western ballads , this is surely the best album to buy !
 Growing up with these tunes playing in Dad 's truck -LRB- he had them on 8 track cassette -RRB- . My Dad 's big influence when he was growing up ? Marty Robbins ! So when I was a little girl , I remember my Dad sitting down with his six-string ... singing all the gunfighter classics -LRB- `` Big Iron '' ... `` Billy the Kid '' -RRB- Even today , among my sisters and I , `` Mr. Shorty '' remains a favorite.My Dad , with his clear tenor ... is a dead-ringer for Marty on `` El Paso '' , and has often told us that `` San Angelo '' topped it by a good 8 minutes in length . I still love to hear Dad sing `` Strawberry Roan '' , and can picture each story unfold as he sings ... from the terror of a night on the trail -LRB- `` Master 's Call '' -RRB- to the dancing and flirting `` Falina '' -LRB- in `` El Paso '' -RRB- ; and even the deadly gunfight between Mr. Shorty and his rival.Each song , sung by my Dad , who used to sit and copy lyrics while listening to Marty 's recordings of them . Mr. Robbins had a clear , concise way of delivering a song that made you believe every word as `` true '' . And I wonder how many of today 's big country artists count Marty Robbins among their heroes?I know my Dad did and still does . It takes some persuading for Dad to sit with his guitar and sing these old songs , but once he gets started ; he does them all . The songs he grew up learning , are timeless . If not `` Gunfighter ballads and Trail Songs '' , I reccommend , `` No. 1 Cowboy '' , or `` the Essential Marty Robbins '' . If for no other reason than to see where `` real '' Country and Western came from .
 Those in charge have had the good sense to take the masters of the MASTER and , by re-enhancing the tracks digitally , are allowing Marty to be heard as he should be heard in this special CD from Epic 's AMERICAN MILESTONES Series . Everyone loves Marty Robbins ... and this collection is a credit to the man and his music .
 I bought this for my daughter for her birthday , she loves it . I like it myself . So I 'm ordering one for me .
 Marty has a wonderful voice and these western songs bring back memories of singing along with him many years ago ... This collection is well worth the purchase price ... Highly recommend you give it a try ! !
 My Fans requst these songs many times a weekand since we all love Older Country music his voice is awesome
 I am a long time fan of Marty Robbins owning 32 albums and several tapes and cd 's . I do not think Marty will ever be forgoten and his music will continue to be played both on radio and recordings . I am probably a bit prejudicial when it comes to western and country music and Marty Robbins as I feel Marty is the greatest and this album only goes to prove how good he really is .
 Marty Robbins learned to play the guitar in the Solomon Islands , so that was at least one good thing that came out of World War II . Back in the States he played clubs and bars , hosted his own radio show and eventually signed with Columbia Records . This record came out in 1959 . I was thirteen and in the eight grade at Bancroft Junior High School in Lakewood , California and I 'll never forget the day my dad brought it home . I played it silly , till there were so many clicks and pops in it I had to get another.Not a bad song on this record . It opens with `` Big Iron '' . A gunslinging song that paints a movie before your eyes as the words pour fourth . `` Texas Red had not cleared leather for a bullet fell he ripped and the ranger 's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip . '' What a line , what a song . `` He might have went on living , but he made a fatal slip , when he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip . '' Ca n't you just see the movie ? `` Billy the Kid '' is another great cowboy song . `` At the age of twelve years he did kill his first man . '' `` Running Gun '' is another great story song , this time the hero does n't win and the lesson learned here is that `` a woman 's love is wasted when she loves a running gun '' . But by far the best song on the record is `` El Paso . '' I heard Bob Dylan talking about this song back when he played it one his Theme Time Radio Hour on XM Radio . He said that Marty Robbins wrote it for Mitch Miller , but Mitch thought it was too long , as did everybody else apparently , so he did it himself . Can you imagine anybody else singing this?This record is Number One on my list of the Best Thirteen Records of 1959 .
 When I Listen To What Passes For C&W Music Nowadays , I GET Depressed.Most Of The New Breed Of Country Singers Are Just Pseudo Rock Singers Latching Onto A Lucrative Market.Marty Robbins Would Be In The Top Five Of My All Time Greats.Gunfighter Ballads Has To BE In The Top Three Of The Greatest Country Albums Ever Recorded.The Marvellous Acoustic Spanish Guitar Sound That Accompanied Most Of His Gunfighter Ballads Is So Refreshing.Being Around Awhile Needless To Say I 'VE Practically All His Albums
 This is really good stuff !! I am generally not much for the country music genre , but this album really takes the listener back to the authentic west . My favorite on this one is Big Iron , the ballad of an Arizona Ranger who comes to town in order to bring in Texas Red , a notorious outlaw . You can practically smell the cordite from the six-shooters ! They 're Hanging Me Tonight is another classic , and I do not use that word loosely.Every tune on this fine album is worth listening to , and many will become favorites of most listeners . There is no better album to play at a western-theme party , or just for the sheer pleasure of listening . Highly recommended .
 I grew up listeniing to Marty Robbins , and the Gunfighter Ballads is my favorite album and I just had to get this CD ... because I use to listen to the music on LP , back in the 80 's and I have n't heard the songs for over 15 years ... with great imagination , listening to these songs would make it seem like you 're watching a very interesting Western movie .
 I find the quality of the CD GUnfighter Ballads & Trail Songs to be fantastic . I never thought I would ever find this album in a CD form . This was one of my favorite albums I loved listening to when I was little . My dad loved this album as well and now that my dad passed away . Everytime I listen to this CD I think of my dad . Thanks Amazon for having it on hand for me to purchase it .
 You get to buy the CD I bought a few years back with only 12 tracks with a bonus of three extra -- total of 15 tracks -LSB- I always told you , Amazon loved you best -RSB- . This is a very good collection of Marty 's songs and the production values are also top notch.To me it 's a question of which Marty Robbins ' album to buy . This one is a good choice . If it only had `` Five Brothers '' , it would be perfect.Nashville is great , but to borrow from the Alan Jackson hit
 I recently purchased this CD at a Grand Canyon gift shop on the south rim as a memoir , what a great choice ! Not only is the CD great because it takes me back to the breathtaking canyon but the CD is great in of itself too . The songs are done so well and create such a clear picture in the listeners mind of the gun battles , close calls -LRB- with stampedes -RRB- , hangings and such . Any Amazon customer that is contemplating buying this CD do it !! You will not be disapointed , it is offered here at a great price too ! Hail to Marty !!
 When I first heard this album back in 1960 -LRB- as a kid of 15 -RRB- I was unimpressed ; I was into a more Pop sound and it was bought by an elder brother of mine and it did nothing for me at the time . Then for some reason I decided to play it one afternoon and I was simply blown away by the singer performing these songs . Marty Robbins was performing them as only he could with such spellbinding emotional sincerity that I became hooked on this artist for life . ` El Paso ' , ` Big Iron , ` Running Gun ' and ` The Master 's Call ' were all movies set to music embellished by the great guitar work of Grady Martin and the vocal accompaniment of Bobby Sykes and Jim Glaser . Previously ` Cool Water ' had been associated with the Sons of the Pioneers or Frankie Laine but it was to become as much a Marty Robbins song thanks to this magnificent version likewise his stirring interpretations of ` Utah Carol ' and ` Strawberry Roan . ` One could ask how could Marty follow this masterpiece but follow it he did because the follow up ` More Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs ' reaches the high standard set by its predecessor.This great album led me back to the records he had released in previous years when I -LRB- and most of the U.K. -RRB- were unaware of him and rued the fact that such a fine artist should have been deprived of many hits in Britain because of mostly second rate cover versions by British singers . ` Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs ' was a success however , in Britain and ` El Paso ' did make our top 20 and a couple of years later ` Devil Woman ' and ` Ruby Ann ' charted and a TV advertized album hit the top 10 but this awesome talent should have had much more recognition over here than he got . How many times in conversation have I mentioned that I was a Marty Robbins fan and be greeted with almost reverence in acknowledgement of his greatness by the person I was talking to ?
 I heard this from my teacher in high school in the 70 's . I have loved it to absolute stinkin ' death ever since ! This is country western ! It sure ai n't Shania Twain !
 Bought a new copy of the classic , Marty Robbins ' Gunfighter Ballads . This Columbia recording is of qood quality . Mr. Robbins ' music has its usual unique , pleasing quality . All songs are smooth and great on the ears .
 This may well be the greatest album of Marty Robbins ' career . He seemed to have a passion for the Western music , although he was one of the greatest `` crooners '' in Country music as well.I only have one complaint here and that is the inclusion of the `` chopped up '' version of El Paso , and -LRB- I guess technically two complaints -RRB- that the full length version of the song is not in stereo . I mean , come on , if the edited version is edited from the full length recording -LRB- and it was with one verse edited out -RRB- and the edited version was recorded in stereo , then would n't it just go unsaid that the full length version should be in stereo as well ?? All in all this is a great album .
 This album will never go out of style . It is classic lyrics , voice , and band combined .
 This is a great cd for any classic country collection . I grew up listening to this cd when it was on a record . This is Marty Robbins at his best ...
 I have the original record album and it is almost worn out from so much playing so we were glad to find it on CD and love to listen to it.I would recommend it to any Marty Robbins ' fan .
 Marty Robbins is the original when it comes to gunfighter ballads . I listened to this on LP at my grandfather 's 40 years ago ; when he passed on , he left it to me . But I play the CD now.Simply outstanding .
 Marty Robbins what else can be said . Great CD of the ballads . I prefer the classics where you have a song that you can understand and listen .
 Received it timely . A great moldy oldie album . I love it .
 Over twenty plus years , I have enjoyed this album - The Masters Call - is as hauntingly beautiful as anything ever written or recorded . A true classic album , a must for any fan of ballads , good melodies , lyrics and voice .
 This was my favorite album years ago ! I found myself singing along , even though it had been long since I had heard them . If you like Marty Robbins , this is his best ballads . I love it !
 I primarily listen to Metal and Punk rock , but have a vested , deep love affair with older country legends -LRB- Cash , Jennings , Horton , Williams , Parton , Rogers , etc. -RRB- and if I could only have 1 album of my country collection , this would probably be it . If you do n't like this as a country fan , you 're absolutely nuts . The stories told , the voice that 's singing , the no flash/frills honest musicianship is , in my mind as a musician , what all artists of all genres aspire to . My only very minimal gripe is the inclusion of `` El Paso '' which is just one of those songs EVERYBODY covers and I 'm kinda worn out on , but his version is good regardless . If you like ballads , whether sung by Johnny Cash , Bon Jovi , or Dimmu Borgir , the song `` Big Iron '' is something you should own this album for on it 's own merit . Buy now . You arent cool if you do n't own this album .
 Forget country -- there is none of it on this album . This is western music , music that celebrates the cowboys and outlaws of the Old West . It is one of my favorite albums ever , and while it may or may not be the greatest in its genre , I think it 's safe to say it 's certainly one of the most beloved western records of all time . It definitely deserves that reputation.They say that Marty Robbins -- perhaps the only real famous son of Glendale , Arizona -- recorded this album all in one day , on April 7 , 1959 . If true , that was a very productive day indeed for American music . `` El Paso '' became a wildly successful crossover single , but really the whole record is fantastic . The beautiful solo guitar fills by session musician Grady Martin are definitely one of the most important keys to the record 's atmosphere and success.One thing I would recommend is programming this CD or MP3 download to play in the order it was originally intended to be heard . The 1959 album went as follows : Side 1:1 . Big Iron2 . Cool Water3 . Billy The Kid4 . A Hundred And Sixty Acres5 . They 're Hanging Me Tonight6 . The Strawberry RoanSide 2:1 . El Paso2 . In The Valley3 . The Master 's Call4 . Running Gun5 . The Little Green Valley6 . Utah CarolThe music is good in any order , and maybe I just like it in the original order because that 's how I listened to it as a kid growing up . Still , I really do find this order more satisfying.Highly recommended as one of the great American recordings from the second half of the 20th century . No kidding !
 The Gunfighter Ballads by Marty Robbins is a great CD . My 6 year-old grandson loves the songs and asks if they are real stories . I show him in my Western history books some of the items the songs are about . He and I really enjoy these .
 This CD is excellently remastered by Sony and is complete , with all the original tracks from the LP with three additional tracks . Columbia engineers were in their hay-day in the early sixties with their crisp recording techniques and capturing of full-bodied tonalities and this album reflects that engineering standard , although recorded in Nashville instead of Hollywood where other great , powerful voices recorded , like Frankie Laine . This Marty collection would have been more complete by including the cut `` Feleena -LRB- from El Paso -RRB- '' which was on his `` The Drifter '' album . The song `` Feleena '' set up the story of `` El Paso '' in more detail , and is a balladeer styled song that gives you more background on the song `` El Paso '' . As an aside , the LP version -LRB- long version -RRB- of `` El Paso '' is what is on this album , not the 45 RPM edit . As mentioned before , this album is complete with none of the songs messed up in any way by Sony 's re-mastering engineers , unlike `` Johnny Horton 's Greatest Hits '' album where `` Johnny Freedom '' is faded out on the end instead of allowing it to crescendo to the end of the song like it does on the original LP .
 Well , let me start with this fact . I can not stand the new Country & Music Artists of today . What words are there ? Comes across to me that they do n't know the words to the song . So they pronounce the words they do remember and the rest is making vocal sounds only ! Not so with Marty ! You can understand each and every word that came out of his mouth . The songs he sings make it very clear , easy to follow & understand . His songs which tell a story like `` El Paso '' - flow easily from beginning to end like reading a good book.It is easy on the ears for relaxation . Your mind can go into a stage of dreaming and being there watching the story play out.I certainly hope that the new country music stars will look back and see how performers such as Marty Robbins , Jim Reeves , Eddy Arnold and The Statler Brothers -LRB- with Lew De Witt - not Jimmy Fortune -RRB- sang . You never saw them sing like they were trying to swallow a microphone . This record lets you go back to the `` good ole days '' of Country Music .
 Although Frank Sinatra is credited with creating the first `` concept '' album . Columbia might have one-upped Capital with this unique `` Old West '' collection . Although its been almost 50 years since this jewel was first recorded , it sounds like it was made yesterday . Marty Robbins has had many hit albums in the C/W top ten , but none of them has been as endearing as this 1959 classic . You get `` El Paso , `` Cool Water '' `` The Hanging Tree '' and 12 more ballards sung by one of Country/Western all-time favorites . I can guarantee , you will continue to listen to these cowboy story songs for years to come .
 I must have been all of five or six when i first heard `` Devil Woman '' played on a local radio station . Even at that tender age , i realised that there was something special about the voice of Marty Robbins . He was able to take any type of music and turn it into something special , whether that music was calypso , country and western , folk or mainstream Marty made the lyrics his own . Nowadays what do we have ? Mindless crap played to , -LRB- it seems -RRB- an equally mindless audience . Kind of makes me think of the lyrics from Simon and Garfunkel 's `` Sounds of Silence , '' `` and the people hear without listening . '' Nobody seems to listen to songs anymore and with the exception of a few `` genuinely '' talented individuals , -LRB- Jewel , The Dixie Chicks , Dwight Yokum , Joss Stone -RRB- everything else is crossed off my list . I am 35 and i HATE what is played to mainstream audiences thesedays ! As soon as my radio is turned on it 's straight to the Nostalgia programs where i can listen to the likes of Marty , Jim Reeves and Frankie Laine . I 'd rather listen to `` El PASO '' or `` GHOST RIDERS IN THE SKY '' than practially anything else . Where have all the real voices gone ? Gone like the dying gunfighter in the `` Streets of Larado '' . It 's all so very , very sad ... If this is the real world -LRB- and real music -RRB- as we have it today , i want to get off ! I hear it BUT i DO N'T like it !!! ... give me a sad , gunfighter ballad anyday !!!! Ira ZettlerAdelaide South Australia .
 This is the acoutic/folk Marty singing about issues with Cowboys . The songs are about some kid who wanted to be known as a man or a story about someoen who was shot . It is very indicative of The Old West . All these songs could have been made into movies . A couple of these songs are well-known , household name classics , Marty 's Folk version of ` Cool Water ' and then there 's possibly his most famous song , ` El Paso ' . Seeing this is acoustic music , and Marty wrote many of the songs himself , this music is very much , to my mind , a precursor to the ` singer-songwriter ' era of the early 70 's . This is a gem that I would recommend to anyone . As I said these are simple songs about interesting , entertaining tales and lovely melodies . The track I like the most is ` They 're hanging me , tonight ' . It has a lovely melody , Marty 's vocals are as emotional as ever and the guitar work is brilliant .
 As a kid , there were 2 records in my parents scant collection that ever captured my imagination . Johnny Cash 's FOLSOM PRISON & this 1959 concept album . Robbins ' epic murder ballad , `` El Paso '' holding particular fascination after our family relocated to that infamous border town.Later , as my tastes gravitated towards The Clash , Pogues , Nick Cave & Tom Waits , it did n't take a genius to figure out there 's one thing they all have in common . The ever romantic notion of the outlaw . His rise , fall & occasional redemption . In terms of capturing the myth of the Old West , GUNFIGHTER BALLADS has few serious rivals . It has the Happy Trails sentimentality of a 10001 Gene Autry movies & and genuine glimpses of violence on par with Johnny Cash 's immortal line , `` I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die '' . But where Cash has his signature ruggedness , Robbins is much more in the tradition of a Pop crooner.Without a doubt , `` Big Iron '' is a classic . Cash even tackled it earlier this year on his posthumous boxed set , UNEARTHED . Like every great pop song , it 's refrain is irresistable . Of course , riding not far behind is `` El Paso '' . These 2 alone are worth the price of admission.Also noteworthy are the gallows weeper , `` They 're Hanging Me Tonight & `` The Master 's Call '' . An ambitious tale of sin & redemption on the open range , it 's just as epic `` El Paso '' . Along with Willie Nelson 's RED HEADED STRANGER , GUNFIGHTER is without a doubt one of Country Music 's greatest concept albums . But unlike alot of cowpokes roaming the dusty trail , there 's a genuine sense of darkness & woe lurking behind the Hollywood sunset . No self-respecting fan of Country , Alt . Country or Americana should be without it .
 Robbins ' interpretation of these ballads has forever made me a fan of Western music . Apart from the seminal `` El Paso '' , his rendition of `` Hanging Tree '' and `` Utah Carol '' really grab you . A must have for anyone interested in truly American music .
 First I 'd like to say I absolutely despise most of the swabby , commercial garbage played on most so-called Country and Western stations today . Have a singer whine and sing through his nose , throw in a little fiddle and some stupid lyrics and presto
 My dad loved Marty Robbins . I have so many memories of summer nights listening to the stereo playing `` Big Iron '' or `` El Paso '' and dad singing along , or actually , talking along , announcing each verse before it came up , sitting in the front yard under a blanket of stars.Both dad and Marty Robbins are gone now . I never thought of collecting Robbins ' albums much until recently , when I became irked at myself for not remembering the lyrics to El Paso . I bought this CD and everything just flooded back . All of these songs are great . `` Cool Water '' , `` Billy the Kid '' ... It was so easy , as a kid , to take Robbins for granted . But now I realize his was a very strong voice . The backup vocals and musicianship , as well as the lonesome-sounding , echoing production , make for a perfect country-western sound .
 Believe me , along with selected CDs by Johnny Cash , Jerry Reed , Patsy Cline , Steve Earle , Hank Williams Sr. , and Willie Nelson , this perfect album by Marty Robbins belongs in the CD collections of any self-respecting rock fan . I normally listen to death metal , hardcore punk , and that ilk , but I still have to have my fix of Mr. Robbins.The cowboy ballads included here are sparse , narrative-driven masterpieces . The only place music like this comes from is the soul . If it 's true that Robbins recorded this in one afternoon , then that afternoon has got to be one of the most amazing dates in music history.The cowboy songs on this disc , although not all written by Robbins , denote a singular vision . There is a romantic aspect to the music in its appreciation of nature , individualism , and especially in its heroic idealization of simple little vignettes about horse-riders of all types . This album is 100 % cohesive even with the extra tracks tacked-on the end.I strongly recommend this CD -LRB- even more than the 2-CD Essential Marty Robbins , which is also great , but not as focused -RRB- for any lover of music or collector of songs . Regardless of your musical leanings , this will find a worthy place in your collection .
 Marty is truly an authentic cowboy singer . When you listen to these songs of the old west , you can actually SEE what he 's singing about and he makes you feel the emotion of the song . As a born Arizonan , he grew up with stories of the old west that his grandfather , Texas Bob Heckle , would tell him . Can you believe that Columbia Records , at first , was reluctant to have him release a ` cowboy ' album , telling him that his ` voice was n't right for cowboy songs ' ... wrong ! Marty possessed a beautiful voice and was ` at home ' in any genre of music , but his western ` stories in song ' were just magnificent . Just give a listen to MAN WALKS AMONG US , THIS PEACEFUL SOD , THE RED HILLS OF UTAH , JOHNNY FEDAVO , BILLY VENERO ... hear this extraordinary voice take you back to the days of the cowboy . I promise you , you WILL feel the sand in your eyes and smell the smoke of the 45 . He makes it that real . If I could recommend any one singer when it comes to cowboy songs , it is MARTY ROBBINS ... he brought the cowboy to life . This album is one of his finest and most sought after collections .
 This album would not only reconnect Country Music with it 's Western Roots , but recreate Marty Robbins ' career for many years to come . The majesty of the talented sound of Tompall and the Glaser Brothers , who created the musical imagery with Marty , and the talented acoustic guitar swells that molded the imagery of Marty 's music , and symbolism of our Southwestern culture created the perfect stepping stone for Country Music for many years after the release of this album.These are not merely songs of the old west , but photo-musical imagery created in the fast-moving mind of the author himself . These were video images conjured up by the musical tales created by an extremely talented musician , which the world will long remember and truly miss.The hero of the piece , `` El Paso '' , is one of the longest single pieces of music ever to become a hit , in any genre , up to the long later intro of Queen , in the genre of rock , many years later . But the length of the piece , not only does not subtract from it 's meaning , but helps to add to the imagery created within it 's entity.All of the music in this album contributes to history of Country Music and to the greater history of the Western Genre . No student of Country Music or lover of the same could possibly exist without a copy of this marvelous collection of images and sounds of the old west.To finish the album by adding , `` The Hanging Tree '' , the theme song from a movie which demonstrated the expansion of our country to the west , was indeed , a measure of divine ingenuity.No lover of Country Music should be without this album .
 Like others who have reviewed this CD , I was first introduced to `` Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs '' by my grandfather and to listen to the songs touches just about every memory I have of him . I have to say that the remastering for CD is nothing short of fantastic . The sounds are all fresh and new , and this is stated by someone who knows every note by heart.There is a real problem with this CD , in that Sony added some `` rare '' B-sides . `` Saddle Tramp '' and `` Hanging Tree '' are available on other collections . I am sure that Sony could have delved in its vaults and come up with some real gems to add to this collection , such as bits and pieces of the recording session itself -LRB- which , in retrospect , seems to be a historic note -RRB- , alternate takes and the like . Instead , it seems that Sony chose to rehash more of the same material it has used before.It is a great job on the CD , but a poor choice of `` new '' material ...
 I grew up listening to this album on vinyl . Many a night I went to bed with the words to `` Big Iron '' and `` Hanging Tree '' running through my mind . Marty Robbins had THE voice for western ballads and this album stands out in my mind as the definitive Western Ballad collection . It makes you close your eyes and imagine yourself on the prairie , sitting around a campfire , and listening to him sing.I still have this album on vinyl but no longer have a player so I am ordering this CD . I 've never gotten tired of his music and I doubt I ever will .
 If you only looked at the cover of this disc and were given no information about it 's contents , you 'd think you would hear the biggest cornball tunes of all time ... but you 'd be dead wrong . ` Gunfighter Ballads ' just happens to be the greatest Western concept album ever recorded.The liner notes to the disc -LRB- which are outstanding -RRB- describe America in the late 1950 's
 This upgraded reissue presents potent , early work that is essential to Robbins ' catalog . Sony has cleaned up the audio , added new liner notes and augmented the original disc with bonus tracks.Robbins ' 1959 LP is oddly anachronistic , having ridden a wave of Old West nostalgia that is now itself 40 years old . Even so , his highly-romanticized images of cowboys and outlaws are as captivating today as the -LRB- single ! -RRB- day on which this album was recorded . Robbins ' singing is breathtaking , backed perfectly by the Glaser Brothers and spiced with Grady Martin 's Mexicali-flavored guitar . Classics like `` Big Iron '' and `` El Paso '' linger in the air like the smell of sagebrush , resulting in an album whose allure is as strong as its mythological subjects .
 My father purchased Marty Robbin 's orginal Gunfighter Ballads album in the early 1960s -- and I played it so many times I 'm surprised the grooves in the record were not worn through . I still knew the words to over half the songs by heart , even though I had n't heard any of them played in 30 years -LRB- at least -RRB- . I ca n't tell you how happy it makes me to have this new CD available -- and hearing it in CD format instead of on my parent 's old cabinet hi-fi system makes it even more of a treat !
 My late Father was born and raised in Wyoming before coming east to Virginia . I taped this album for him and he played it in his car . I think he and Marty would have hit it off . The two versions of El Paso make this edition extra special .
 And of course , having the movie of &#34; The Hanging Tree &#34; , which Marty Robbins sang the title song , I just had to have this album also .
 my dad used to always play this album when I was a little kid in the seventies . I still really enjoy hearing these old song 's .
 Ca n't beat the voice of Marty Robbins . We oldies really like those oldies . We remember him from way back when
 Probably my all-time favorite album , ever . When I was little , I had to hear it every day . At 39 , it has n't lost a bit of charm for me . Marty Robbins has such a great voice . This album introduced me to Sons of the Pioneers -LRB- they originally sang most of these songs -RRB- . Love it love it love it !
 My husband has always liked to listen to Marty Robbins , and this CD fits the bill . He does n't usually listen to CDs , but he listens to this one .
 Classic old time Marty Robbins . With his special voice , he 's a hard act to follow . A good CD for Marty fans .
 A stroll down memory lane as I sang along to each song . Surprised that I still remembered all the words
 in the world of cowboy tunes this is definately the top of the classic gold tunes . a must have for all collections
 Marty Robbins recorded some of the best cowboy music ever recorded . This album is , I think , his very best ever !
 I just love to hear Marty Robbins soothing voice singing , have n't heard this music for a while though . Brings back memories of my youth . just love it ... hope you will too
 This is not to say that Marty Robbins did not perform many more and just as great songs . However when you think of ether Marty Robbins or the songs on this album -LSB- Gunfighter Ballads & Trail Songs -RSB- . As with many I grew up with this album and as one reviewer protests , it is a little unnerving to have the order changed . However I used to skip around anyway . And this is the album to buy for Marty Robbins . You can supplement with his others when you feel the need to expand his collectionIt is hard to imagine that you have not heard these songs at some point . So it feels funny describing them to you . These songs are truly ballads . They are not crying in your beer twanging songs . And aside from the country pacing and theme , are close to folk songs . Each song has a story and you are made to feel that you could be singing them your self . In the end you will be singing them.The Essential Marty Robbins
 If you only buy one Country and Western music album in your life , this is the one to get ! Growing up in West Texas , I originally hated country music as that was the only thing playing ! But this is the one album of my father 's that I really liked . Now that I 'm older , I 've grown to really like country music . There 's great music by Willie , Waylon , Johnny Cash , and many others . But there is no album that captures the spirit of the old west with classic ballads sung by an underrated master , Marty Robbins . Buy it , you 'll wo n't be sorry !
 I first bought this alblum when it was released on vinyl in the mid 60 's . Any fan will tell you Marty Robbins was a gifted singer , but coupled with the material of old ballads this is one of his masterpieces . If you listen to the song `` Big Iron '' carefully you will hear some of the most brilliant guitar work I have ever heard . I listen to the song just for that treat . The song `` Strawberry Roan '' is a poem by a famous Cowboy poet put to music . Sorry , I ca n't name the poet right now , but your library would be a good source for Western/Cowboy poets.In short , my view of this work is an anthology of ballads of the American West that are recorded in classic Marty Robbins style . In the century to come , fans of Wild West history can know that these ballads were tales of events that happened , not TV movie themes . The thrilling story of `` Utah Carol '' no doubt really happened . I get goose bumps just thinking of Utah 's self sacrifice.Buy and cherish this alblum it is priceless .
 While Marty Robbins hardly ever sang a bad song , this small collection truly represents what he is all about . These songs are how Mr. Robbins began , and these songs are his spirit . His whole heart and soul saturate this music , and you just ca n't help but live it with him as he sings .
 I do n't care a whole lot for classical country , but our family has had this album ever since I can remember , and I have always liked it !
 I have searched far and wide to find the Marty Robbins Gunfighter ballad and trail song cd . and was unable to locate it anywhere till now . It put you in a relaxing atmosphere where you just lay and let your imagination drift with every selection that plays . The strong rich voice of Marty along with his backups provides a unique blend of pure harmony .
 Not much else to say . Every song on this CD is just great . Great classic country music from the late 50 's .
 In a world in which country and western has slowly melted into country and roll -LRB- rock that is -RRB- , Marty Robbins ' collection of self composed cowboy western ballads gives everyone a stark reminder of country 's true roots . A truly unique musical experience no matter what your tastes in music are .
 I love the songs on this CD . They are some great examples of classic country .
 Brings back memories of 59-60 when I first listened to Marty Robbins . I lived in El Paso when that one hit the charts .
 I received the CD and we are really enjoying listening to it . It arrived quickly and was in good shape .
 the cd was good as new no scrathes just good clean sound.Gunfighter Ballads & Trail Songs
 As a jazz and rock guy , this recording was not a suspect for my favorites collection . But I ran across a few songs on satellite radio and bought the CD . Now it 's one of the ten recordings I take on the road or camping any time . Besides the mesmerizing and realistic lyrics of Robbins , there 's the spanish influenced guitar of Grady Martin that turns this poetry into music . After hearing it a hundred times , I 'm still hearing things I missed . I do n't know when a remastered version will come out , but I 'll buy it when it does .
 Although I bought this for just the long version of `` El Paso '' the entire recoding brought back memories of my long , gone youth ! The delivery was super , as are most are with Amazon .
 THIS IS CLASSIC MUSIC FOR ALL THOSE WHO LOVE COUNTRY AND THOSE WHO DO NOT . THROUGHLY ENJOY !!
 Us old farts need music too . I had it on a record and wanted a new one , because I enjoy this old real music .
 Thank you Amazon for offering this particular album . Have it on vinylfrom first issue . So happy that I can now hear favorites from the paston current electronics .
 This is a really wonderful CD . I remember the music from my youth and ca n't believe how good these old songs sound today nearly 50 years later . The mastering is excellent with very open and dynamic sound .
 Arrived in timeframe promised and in perfect condition . Purchasing is very easy using Amazon 's 1-click process .
 Marty Robbins is one of my dad 's favorite singers , as well as one of my own . This cd has most of my favorite Marty Robbins songs . I absolutely love all the old cowboy songs like `` Strawberry Roan '' .
 Marty Robbins / Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs -LRB- bonus tracks CD -RRB-
 No one could sing western songs better than Marty Robbins . ` Big Iron ` is my favorite on this CD . I went to one of his concerts a few years before his death . He had a bad sore throat but he put all of his energy -LRB- and what voice he had with his illness -RRB- into his performance . What an entertainer ! ` Cool Water ' is another great track . I imagine being out on the prairie or sitting by a campfire at night . `` Cowboys ' and ` cowgirls ' should love this CD .
 I used to listen to this album when I was a teenager all the time , the cd has an extra song and sound as good or better than ever
 purchased this for my dad , i remember when i was a kid he use to sing em all the time . And now he 's singing them again , and remembers all of the words . . Its great !! Brings back alot of memories . .
 Marty had one of the great western voices of all time and this is a great collection that I am just loving to listen to .
 One reviewer mentions that the songs on this CD are not in the order that they appeared on the original LP . The correct track order of the original LP is : Side 1Big IronCool WaterBilly the KidA Hundred and Sixty AcresThey 're Hanging Me TonightStrawberry RoanSide 2El PasoIn the ValleyThe Master 's CallRunning GunDown in the Little Green ValleyUtah Carol
 Like many others here , I grew up listening to Marty Robbins and Frankie Laine and my dad singing along . Their songs always take me back and give me that feeling of home . One thing my dad said to me that comes back to me from time to time is that the artists of Marty Robbins ' era were great at telling stories with their music . I was listening to one of my son 's songs the other day and all the artist did was sing one single refrain over and over and over ... It got really old really quick . It made me come home and pull out the ` good ' music . I have been listening to Marty Robbins for more than 30 years and never get tired of his voice .
 Every Marty fan , every country music lover , every folk music fan , and every Americana collector should have this CD . Perfect singing , great song selection , superb accompaniment , and both the long and short versions of `` El Paso '' are found here . `` El Paso '' is a story song written by Marty that matches or exceeds the best of Woody Guthrie 's ballads . I put it in the class of songs like `` Tom Joad '' and `` East Texas Red . '' Marty 's mix here of originals and traditional songs was a key release of the Folk Revival , and the one that made it OK for country singers to make common cause with the hippies who loved folk songs . Eddy Arnold 's album `` Thereby Hangs a Tale '' also fits this groove , and came along at about the same time , but Marty 's album is even better as a whole . `` Big Iron '' is the leadoff tune , and it too , has shown staying power over 50 years , but `` El Paso '' is the iconic Marty Robbins creation .
 My dad had this album when I was a kid and listened to it a lot . He really liked Marty Robbins . Now , a zillion years later , I stumbled upon this album while surfing around Amazon looking for music . This is great ! I love how simply this is recorded - just Marty Robbins ' voice and an acoustic guitar in the background . He has a really nice musical voice . This is not the kind of music I would normally listen to . I have always liked artists like Al Dimeola , Stevie Ray Vaughan , Roy Buchanan , etc. and have never liked `` country '' music , but this is certainly an exception ! My dad is n't doing so well these days and I thought I would send him a copy and it might help brighten his day . I like it so much , I may just buy a copy for myself too!I especially like `` Cool Water '' - I remember that song oh so well from around the house when I was a kid , and I liked it then . I could listen to 70 's rock like Foghat , Led Zeppelin , etc. upstairs , then go downstairs and listen to Marty Robbins with my dad - `` cool , clear water '' . I also always liked `` El Paso '' too . Really , every single song on this album is great !
 I bought this cd a few days ago and already know its a classic . The reviewer who gave it one star because the song order was not right , needs to get a life . I hate reviewers who give a star or two because of dumb crap like that . This cd is diffently better then anything you 'll hear on a radio . Country singers are greedy . Everything you need to hear has been written and everything today is about sex and alcohol . These songs tell a story , and Marty Robbins probably wasnt too greedy for money like todays stars are . He was a proud American , but not because of 9-11 . Yea im talking about Toby Keith and Alan Jackson right there . Great music , a diffent must own cd .
 The lable attached to the CD says `` All Time Country Classic '' . It 's misleading . This is an all time classic , period . I first bought this collection as an LP . The front said `` High Fidelity '' , not `` Stereo High Fidelity , '' but as a kid in 1959 , I did n't care . `` El Paso '' was # 1 on the pop charts . Marty Robbins had been a `` cross-over '' artist making the charts with `` A White Sport Coat and a Pink Carnation , '' so I was primed when this album hit . Grammy-winning `` Gunfighter Ballads ... '' set Marty Robbins apart . It is n't country , it is n't '50s pop , it might be Americana or folk music . It is cowboy or western music , I suppose . There are more reasons to own this album than `` El Paso . '' `` Cool Water , '' `` The Master 's Call . '' Utah Carol , '' `` and `` The Strawberry Roan '' are all great songs interpreted by a great voice . `` Gunfighter Ballads ... '' is what it now says on the CD jacket , a `` classic . '' Marty Robbins died in his early sixties , so many younger ears may not know him . They should , especially if they collect the good stuff from all eras .
 If you want to buy this CD just for `` El Paso '' you 'll be plenty happy . If you allow yourself to listen to the remaining tracks , you 'll be very happy . This was Marty 's best effort , IMHO.The remastering is done very well , although the source recording , being in 1959 , does have its limitations . Overall , a very enjoyable CD , and well worth the work done to remaster and restore it !
 This album by Marty Robbins was among my first every purchases in the area of music . It is largely western standards and original material . All of the songs tell a story with good harmony , excellent instrumental accompanyment and just plain good music from a long time successful popular singer and songwriter in both the popular and country music of that era -LRB- about 1955 -RRB- - I have bought this album in vinyl , cassette and now in DVD since the cassette has finally worn out . It is as good today as it was back when !
 Now this is what I call Country Western Music ! Today 's music may be country , but it 's more rock than western.I grew up listening to my Dad 's old 45 rpm versions of these songs and was thrilled to be able to pick up the extended CD !
 I really do . In fact I never liked it - but I love Chet Atkins , Johnny Cash , and ESPECIALLY this CD by Marty Robbins . That should tell you something . What a recording masterpiece , a true gem . I 'd bet that this is the album that inspired Workingman 's Dead . All the songs are about dying and desperation on the open plains - what could be better ? Put this on , and relax to memories you could never have possibly experienced .
 I 've owned this album for only three days and it 's already my favorite album of all time , of any genre . The reverb on the vocals is noteworthy ; it imparts an open prairie feel to each song . The simple , unobtrusive instrumentation allows the vocals to really soar . `` The Master 's Call '' is incredible . They do n't write songs like this anymore .
 I never been much of a Country music listener until recently . I purchased this CD during my unforgetable trip to the Southwest in 2005 . This is inretrospect , a great way to relive the memories . It 's also the chance to listen to a master storyteller . I 've always enjoyed Marty Robbins ' stories of the Old West . From Utah Carol to Big Iron , from Cool Water to El Paso , the songs tell stories about how life in the west was like during the late 1800 's to the early 1930 's . Enjoy this outstanding greatest hits collection from a master storyteller !
 This is perhaps the best album ever . I grew up in the 70s listening to the original vinyl album of this . It did not have the extra tracks but it did n't need them . It was the best album in my early youth . I loved singing along with it , feeling the emotion of the characters and being carried off to a place where the world was completely different than the one I lived . Among my favorites was Big Iron and Billy the Kid . This does not mean the others were not great , they all are awesome songs . I just prefered those two.Today like another who post here , I listen to a range of metal and rock music , mostly with a gothick flavor such as Nightwish . However , I still enjoy this album , which is why now I decided to get its CD . I still own the vinyl but seldom do I play vinyl albums . Thus it was time I got this on CD . I am glad I did , now I can hear the few non-rock songs that I do love.You can not go wrong with this CD , if you are farily mature as a kid with an active imagination and a flavor for things of high quality , this is a CD to purchase . While you really do not need the extra tracks , you can safely ignore them .
 This is one of several albums that kept me going thru the bad times of my life ; the Ventures and the Four Seasons , as well as the Rightuos Brothers made the rest . I first heard this album in 1969 , fell in love with it , and now own that copy , another one I bought myself in 1978 , as well as BOTH cd versions . If that is n't enough recommendation , then I also have a scale model of one of the cars Marty raced in NASCAR competition -LRB- he finished in the top 10 in a third of the events he entered , including some Daytona 500 's ! -RRB- to show you.These songs ring true because the voice was true . He knew the men , the land . Much like Louis L'Amour did . So far as I know , none of the stories told here are anything but stories . The beauty of the voice brings the people to life with such vivid tones that you actually see them -LRB- or in ` El Paso ' , live it -RRB- in person . 100 stars for this one , for real .
 A lot of these I remember when Marty Robbins first released them and still enjoy them . The CD arrived on time and in good shape .
 I bought this album because I remembered listening to it as a kit , only then it was on a very scratched and worn-out vinyl LP . I recently returned from a vacation trip to the `` Old West '' where I heard a couple of cuts from the album and decided to get a CD version of it . No more scratches or distortions . Very good recording quality . I 'm quite happy with it .
 This CD , is truly Marty 's best ! Traditional country music to me , helps every human being become decent , down to earth and not rebellious , and more loyal . That is what has happened to me . I have learned a lot about good manners by listening to good clean country music and story telling songs by Marty , Porter Wagoner , Jimmie Davis , of course , everybody 's favorite , the Man In Black Johnny Cash , my idol Mr. Eddy Arnold , Jim Reeves , Hank Snow , Red Sovine , Jimmy Dean , Hank Williams , Bill Anderson and the list goes on and on . I am 28 and love Marty Robbins . I own all his LP 's and have them all on my computer which I have converted to CD . I first heard El Paso when I lived in England from 1996-98 . I am blind in both eyes and use a computer with a speech capability . Brilliant cowboy music at its best !
 i am super excited record was in beautiful condition no marks or scratches some dust but that was expected ... slip cover and dust cover in good condition ... slight discoloration on dust cover but again to be expected from normal age ... i am extremely happy as this was a gift to a great friend who listenedto this record with his grandfather when he was little
 Good price on some terrific music . Cd arrived on time , well packaged . It plays on my machines , sounds good , no problems .
 This is one of the `` great '' campfire CD 's . Use it for my hunting trips ! Thanks to Amazons references for similar items to review . The CD came quick-and is of great quality .
 My father 's 60 year old record collection includes this truly outstanding album by Marty Robbins . I have many fond memories of listening to this record with my dad as a little boy . Maybe it 's a case of trying to relive my childhood or perhaps I have finally become my father but when I realized that this LP was available in MP3 format I felt that I absolutely had to have it in my own playlist so I wasted no time and purchased it . I was not in the least bit disappointed . Marty 's voice still rings as clear and true as it did when I first heard these songs back in 1965 and the simple but skilled instrumental accompaniment is as plaintive and haunting as it was to a 3 year old cowboy sitting with his dad on a Saturday night . Times and musical tastes have obviously changed considerably since Robbins released this masterpiece and these songs will certainly sound dated compared to the music being released by contemporary artists so do n't expect Kenney Chesney . But if you 're looking for a record that epitomizes the roots of Country & Western Music , this album needs to be in your collection .
 I love this cd . It is one of my favorite albums . The songs of the wild west come alive when you listen to his music . Reminds me of old west movies with John Wayne . Or maybe Bonanza or Gunsmoke ! Highly recommended !
 None of Marty Robbins music is bad , but the best part of it all , I got to meet him personally at a concert , totally awesome man , he was suppose to have done a concert with Merle Haggard , Marty did the whole show by himself , did an awesome job , just love his music .
 I had heard El Paso on the radio , and , just had to have the whole album !! Great sound and quality ...
 I must admit that I have the record from more years ago than I care to mention . Marty Robbin 's rich voice and the `` old '' western style music make for delightful listening . I have anxiously awaited , but never dreamed that there would be a CD of these wonderful songs . The mix of songs , the accompaniments and the title artist make this a recording that should be in every `` western '' music lovers collection .
 ALL the songs in this collection are great both in lyrics and music ! You 'll love it as one of his best even if you 're not especially a major fan of Marty 's .
 This has to be one of the most classic country and western albums of all time . Robbins always truly one the finest country singers , is presented here doing what he did best the oulaw ballads . The accompanying players are the icing on this sweet cake of country delights . The impeccable lead playing of the great Grady Martin alone , are worth the insanely low price of admission . Sony outdoes itself producing amazing quality sound from these very old master tapes . At the $ 7.99 listed price this has to be the biggest bargain on amazon today .
 Old standards that have been great for almost fifty years . Well worth having in one 's collection .
 Here you have the classic `` El Paso '' , the first of a trilogy of songs about Feleena and the unnamed cowboy who had no reason to be jealous we later find out . -LRB- Marty Robbins never said where he got the unique Spanish-American name found nowhere else -RRB- . `` Cool Water '' of course was a song written by a hero of Marty 's , Bob Nolan of the original Sons of the Pioneers . `` Big Iron '' was inspired by an older relative of Marty 's who told him tales of the Arizona Rangers , a small band of lawmen from Wild West days . `` Strawberry Roan '' had been done years earlier in a Gene Autry movie and is effectively covered here by Marty . He also sung the theme song to the movie , `` The Hanging Tree '' which gave it a more satisfying ending . This is a good compilation of Western songs ; nobody did it better than Marty Robbins . There could have been others such as Nolan 's `` Song of the Bandit '' you 'll find on other compilations but nevertheless I can recommend this one highly .
 Purchased as a gift . . God Bless America ! . God Bless America ! . God Bless America ! . God Bless America !
 This one I ordered from Amazon Prime The Only Way To Go.I can review this one and its Great.These ballads and trail songs all seem to tell a story.So Sit back and listen to Marty Robbins sing of the Old West.You can see what is happening as he sings , the storys unfold as you listen.Very Good CD.Thanks Amazon Prime.M.A.FLICK
 I thought this was a cd , no mp3 ca n't play them in the car were i would be listening to them most of the time . No cd available ??
 WE who love the old west and Marty Robbins find it all in this album . The song are of a period long gone but you feel like you are there as this album unfolds . The extra songs are like a gift for fans who have followed Marty since his first appearance on The Grand Old Opery . I thought i knes all 0f his songs but was suprised as I listened to `` The Rose '' and other new songs on this album . It was like getting to visit with a friend who has passed away .
 Marty Robbins is one of the `` forgotten '' superstars of country music , a man who wrote and sang some of the best country - and pop - tunes ever composed . Although the songs might be considered simple and innocent by today 's country crowd , Robbins great talent combined with an amazing band and excellent production make for a totally authentic journey into the past . My Dad listened to Mart Robbins a lot when I was a little kid . Now I understand why ! This is a great album .
 I 've literally waited my entire life for this CD . My grandfather bought me the Capital LP in 1964 , and I have played it religiously ever since . This collection of Marty 's own ` gunfighter ballads ' and old Western standards sounds as genuine today as the afternoon in April , 1959 when it was recorded . Besides bringing out Marty 's beautiful tenor voice , the remastered CD also showcases the wonderful Spanish-influenced lead guitar work of Grady Martin -LRB- especially on ` El Paso ' and ` Utah Carol ' -RRB- . If you loved the LP , buy this CD and rejoice . If you 've never heard the LP , buy this and be blown away . Hey , they do n't come any cooler than Marty Robbins ...
 MARTY ROBBINS-GUNFIGHTER BALLADS & TRAIL SONGS
 This was a hard to find music disc . We wanted it as a Father 's Day gift . It 's one of his favorites that he missed when vinyl technology wore out . He was overjoyed to recieve it and put it on right away . He was impressed with the quality and pleased to sing along with the songs . He knew all the words and had a hard time not tearing up when he heard them again . This was definitely a hit as a gift for him , a man who is hard to buy for . We enjoyed them too . We do n't get many opportunities to surprise him anymore , so this was a grand one . At Amazon we purchased two of Dad 's favorite old albums that he thought he 'd never hear again . What a wonderful age we live in , that the internet can help us find such things .
 This is a brilliant Cd , it is as if this music was made just for Marty Robbins , great tracks , if you like songs from Cowboy films , easy to listen to or sing along with this
 I remember these songs as a boy . REAL western music . They really hold up well , today ! What a voice ! And some really cool story-telling lyrics .
 After many years of not hearing most of these songs I still remembered the words to almost every one . Marty Robbins was one of the true country greats .
 all i can say is its a great C.L.A.S.S.I.C. all time great album , soothing acoustic guitar and heart stirring lyrics
 As a child , my dad used the attic space in our house to store his thousands of books . On Sunday afternoons , I would get to climb those stairs with him so that we could spend time together doing something we both loved - reading and listening to music . These days , I have three distinct memories of those albums
 forget any labels ... country , western , whatever ... this is a timeless piece of art . people from all walks of life and fans of all genres will appreciate the soaring baritone of marty robbins , and the beautiful stories told on this record . an aboslute classic .
 If you want to own one Marty Robbins CD , this is the one to buy ! It is classic Robbins . This brings back memories of a happier , saner time , when the good guys always won , and you knew who the good guys were . Classic western ballads that you will be singing along when you listen , and humming when you are n't . The music is unforgettable and timeless .
 My grandmother had this album when I was a kid -LRB- early 70s -RRB- and it was old then . I loved the cowboy songs and Marty Robbins voice is really unique . The clear full sound of the remastered CD is really a treat . It is really too bad that country songs we hear on the radio today do not tell the story like these songs of a earlier generation . Marty Robbins was a REAL singer and you will not be dissatisfied with this CD .
 This is a truly classic collection of songs sang by the immortal Marty Robbins . An underrated guitarist , Mr. Robbins had a voice you hear once in a lifetime . His gunfighter ballads are the stuff little boys go to bed dreaming of -LRB- I was one of them ! -RRB- `` Big Iron '' `` His Master 's Call '' and `` They 're Hangin ' Me Tonight '' are so beautifully sang by this legend of Country music ; if you 've missed an episode of `` The Big Valley '' just listen to these tunes and you 'll be right back at the Barkley ranch ! Do n't miss `` Cool Water '' !
 Many artists have attempted this genre of music and failed ; Marty Robbins is the standard bearer and the avant-garde of western ballads . It 's in his blood and his emotional involvement in the ballads he sings draws you into the imagery of each musical poem . A performer without an equal , Marty Robbins and his musicians have mastered the art of emcouraging the listener , through outstanding lyricism and vocal delivery , to form one 's own mental picture through audio art . These selections are performed such that , in essence , they create a theater of the mind . You can almost taste the dust from that El Paso street ! You become a part of the ballad.It 's hard to believe these songs have been around since 1960 . My musical interests are rather mercurial and have fluctuated and broadened since then . However , these songs I review here are as fresh and enjoyable as they were when I was 13 years old . You all know how it goes what with jumping from AM rock & roll to psychedelia to country to heavy metal to classical and whatever . Despite the genre I may have been `` into '' for any particular year , I have come to realize that Marty has been the one constant in my music-listening life . I regret not having seen one of his performances.This CD is a must for fans of music and not limited to C&W folks . On originality alone , it is unequalled ; on imagery , un-paralleled . It is a great collection of ballads to enjoy for years to come .
 and use it on the talentless , commercialized , white trash trolls who call themselves `` country '' singers today
 We had this album in the 1960 's and my dad loved it . It was a real treat for me to find it as a CD and get it for him ... he loves it
 Thank goodness for the American Milestones series - remastering classic country recordings and cleaning up the sound to a beautiful degree.My buying this CD was influenced by listening to another country musician , Don Walser , who always finds space for a few Robbins covers on his releases . There were several classics on this CD that I remembered from my youth -LRB- Big Iron , El Paso , Cool Water -RRB- , and I caught myself singing along quite a bit , reliving the times I listened to old-school country on my grandfather 's homemade radio.If only today 's country stations and their listeners had a clue . Sometimes you just have to go back to the basics .
 I , like a lot of others in Arizona , was raised on this album when it first came out in the 60 's . Bought the tapes , both 4 then 8 track then the cd . This is pure Marty Robbins , and what took him from Grand avenue honky tonks in Phoenix , glendale and peoria Arizona to the big time . However Marty Robbins did not write El Paso . It was written by Elizabeth Garrett , Sherriff Pat Garretts ' blind daughter . That information used to be on the early recordings of it .
 Every song here is special . I remember skipping a day of school my senior year -LRB- sorry , Mom -RRB- , driving around listening to the tape I had of this . When this special edition CD came out , I jumped on it . Excellent songwriting , superior musicianship , and possibly one of the best voices in the history of country music make this album a keeper . Marty Robbins spins tales of danger , love , and death and enraptures the listener in the process . `` Utah Carol '' tells the story of sacrifice in the face of danger . `` Running Gun '' speaks about how you can never turn your back on a life of crime completely . `` The Master 's Call '' is a supernatural cowboy tale . Of course , the two standouts on this album are `` Big Iron '' and `` El Paso '' . Both are Leone/Ford-esque tales of confrontations . The latter being between a reformed criminal , his loved one , and the law , and the former being between two men on opposite sides of justice . Close your eyes and imagine what Tarantino would do with these songs . I would say , this and Red-Headed Stranger would be number 1 and 2 on a list of country concept albums . Big-time props to the Glaser Brothers for superior harmonies , and Grady Martin for some of the greatest guitar work ever heard on vinyl , tape , or disc . This is n't just a present for grandpa . If you are drawn in by Johnny Cash 's American Recordings , then you will love this .
 For anyone who knows or has heard of the egalitarian ranks of the freedom fighters of the Spanish Civil War , this international collection of fiery , heartfelt songs from the men and women who were first to fight fascists in the 20th century will fire your heart and cause your fist to fly up in glorious solidarity and brotherhood ! . Not only are these songs taken from the original , traditional words and tunes of over sixty years ago , but they are arranged and performed as though you are there , listening to the actual music of this frightening and rousing time . I was fortunate enough to see Smith and the O'Reillys in concert -LRB- February , 2001 at the yearly Volunteers of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade gathering in Oakland , CA -RRB- and ca n't help but feel sorry for those who have not yet seen these magnificent and talented musicians re-create one of the most powerful musical moments of American and world history . Buy this album and join the battle !
 This CD is a true gem ! It captures all the intensity and emotion that is such an important element of the songs in this show . I can think of no other voices other than Jamie O'Reilly and Michael Smith who could have done it better . If you 've been lucky enough to see this show , this CD is a must ! If you have n't seen the show , it 's even MORE of a must !
 Jamie O'Reilly 's voice gives a heartfelt earnestness to this re-interpretation of the well known Spanish Civil War repertory . The ensemble is tight and introduces interesting rhythms to the songs . Many people have asked me how to purchase this CD but i think it is no longer available .
 This CD is really amazing . The songs are so powerful and are sung just beautifully . In response to `` A Music Fan from Israel , '' I 'd just like to say that the CD 's subtitle is `` Songs of the Spanish Civil War , '' not `` Songs from ... '' and I 'm sure that the title was not meant to be `` decieving . '' `` Pasiones '' is a wonderful mix of languages and I enjoy the contrast between songs about the War and songs that were sung by the soldiers . This is a really wonderful CD .
 Sure to be a Christmas classic ! Played on either handmade or vintage insturments , the tones to their songs are unforgetable !

 After about 10 years together and a few band member changes the Amazing band Allies decides the band has run it 's course and it 's time to call it quits . They left 6 wonderful albums to their credit and this one was a great high note to leave us with .
 Possibly the best available perfomance of Tannhaeuser on record . Almost ideal conducting and _ incredible _ Vinay in the title role . Strange , but it is very hard to find a good recording of this opera . Well-known Solti and Sinopoli sets both have major flaws and gross problems with casting , old recordings with Melchior are in awful sound . This one is well balanced . Maybe the only miscast is Fischer-Dieskau for Wolfram , he sounds too light to me .
 I agree with the earlier reviewer here . This is a surprisingly good performance of an incredibly difficult opera to bring off successfully . Especially when you consider that the conductor was a late replacement for the fired original maestro . Good mono sound -LRB- 1954 -RRB- with dynamic pacing by conductor Keilberth makes for an electric listening experience . All the more is felt the loss of this fine musician from a too early death . All the parts are more than competently sung . Highly recommended . The only performance I like better is an aircheck performance from the Metropolitan Opera of the incomparable Melchior with George Szell conducting from 1942 . If you must have a stereo recording , I would buy the Decca Solti lead set . This opera always benefits from a live theatrical performance .
 Bruce Molsky combines rhythm , intricacy , creativity , and passion into this collection of tunes . The variety ranges from old time American folk -LRB- in a variety of cross tunings , for you fiddle fanatics -RRB- to a beautiful African melody . A combination of instrumental and vocal pieces keeps the CD quite interesting . Molsky is a great musician .
 If your ears do n't take to scratchy reissues and field recordings of archaic mountain music , you could do a whole lot worse than to pick up on this smartly executed recreation of the sounds of Appalachia , circa a century ago . Bruce Molsky is a talented multi-instrumentalist , a decent if not outstanding singer , and a keen student with an encyclopedic knowledge of the tradition . This last has the happy consequence of introducing us to songs and tunes most listeners , including those of us who can never get enough old-time music , have n't heard before , or at least often . Only `` I Truly Understand '' and `` Fishing Blues '' could be called warhorses , and surely only the grumpiest misanthrope would object to their inclusion . My favorites are `` Rove , Riley , Rove '' -- one of those songs that keep playing in your head long after the CD has been put to bed -- and `` The Poor Cowboy . '' The latter is a splendid cowboy variant of the often-recorded mining folk song `` Roll on , Buddy . '' I had no idea such a thing existed . Revival recordings of old-time music are as often as not fairly boring , but Poor Man 's Troubles is a happy exception .
 Say what you want about this trio of proteges of the once omnipresent MC Hammer , Oaktown 's 357 had the potential to be as big as the Hammer man himself with fierce lyrical delivery , hyperkenetic dance moves , flashy videos backed by catchy pop beats -LRB- in an interview it was said the group chose `` 357 '' as numbers symbolizing strength and power -RRB- . This album was originally released in 1989 , a year before Hammer 's own career peaked . Unfortunately by the beginning of the '90s both acts failed to keep up with the changing pop landscape and the advent of `` gangsta '' rap . The inevitable backlash came against Hammer , Oaktown 's 357 and other `` cheesy '' rap acts . Most female rappers with the exception of Salt N ' Pepa were already forgotten by the time 357 -LRB- now a duo -RRB- released their far inferior sophomore disc `` Fully Loaded . '' And even today with the world wide web there is little information about this enigmatic and short-lived group . Therefore it is great to see this `` guilty pleasure '' get re-released and remastered WITH an awesome DVD that includes not only all the videos from `` Wild and Loose : `` 357 Straight At YouYeah , Yeah , YeahJuicy Gotcha KrazyWe Like It -LRB- Get Loose -RRB- ... but also the videos from `` Fully Loaded : `` HoneyIt 's Not Your MoneyTurn It UpI had not seen a couple of these ever , and had not seen the others in many years so this was really a treat and reminded me how irresistably watchable the videos were -LRB- thanks no doubt to MC Hammer and his handlers -RRB- . I did have to wince at seeing `` Straight at You '' again , where `` Terrible T '' and `` Sweet LD '' lip-synched the parts of `` Little P , '' who for some reason was gone by the time the video was shot -LRB- random trivia
 This album does n't seem to get the respect it deserved . It did n't get the respect it deserved when it was released back in 89 , and it 's pretty much forgotten now . This is a shame.Why do the other reviews slack this album for being produced by MC HAMMER ? Yes , everyone knows that MC HAMMER brought these girls up , and did most of the work for their album , including promotion and production . However , slow down for a second before you critisize them for this , and ponder this questions
 This group came out strong in 89 ' after performing with Hammer since 87 ' . As part of the Oaktown Posse these ladies were more than just some of the best hip-hop dancers of that time they had skills on the mic as well . After shooting the music video for Yeah , Yeah , Yeah the group had a little drama that led to Lil ' P leaving the group . Another reviewer said that she was the keyboard player in Bobby Brown 's video but that is incorrect . That girl was a back up dancer for 357 known as Vicious C not part of the group . Lil ' P was the other girl in the video aside from Terrible T and Sweet LD and she can also be seen in the Hammer video for Pump It Up . Anyway this cd was remastered very well and sounds great . I wish the B Angie B version of Juicy was included as well as the remix for We Like It with only TT and Sweet LD . But the videos are great anyway .
 I agree with j arce -LRB- puertorocreppin -RRB- the ladies of oaktown 's 357 never truly got the respect they deserved . I was and still am a huge fan of this group and was very excited when i found out they finally released all their hit videos -LRB- along with their remastered hit cds -RRB- They come from an era when hip hop was n't all about violence/hate . -LRB- which few people under 30 will understand -RRB- you see back then it was all about the party . True they did n't have the tightest lyrics but at the same time they still held their own and definetely put on a show . There are a more than a few club bangers on this dics and this cd is a must buy to add to any old school hip hop head 's list .
 Chad one of the other reviewers is half wrong about the DVD.The Turn It Up video is not on it.That 's why I 'm giving it 4 stars .
 I previously had seen Oaktown 's 3.5.7 `` 3-5-7 straight at you '' on Vh1 soul and it was a great video.The dances , The girl 's and the rhymes were great ! . As a young black old-school hip hop fan I LOVED THESE GIRLS and their song was a hit.If anyone out there has any info on these girl 's ... please keep me posted.Until Then ... peace !
 This is mostly chimey fuzzy reverby NSB pop , less frenetic than their first two albums but still rocking . Twilight Exit and The Light is Green are a little different ; two great songs that foreshadow Graig Markel 's soulful solo recordings .
 This album presents an impeccable recording and beautiful instrumentation and some very pleasant vocals . Like the country itself , the music represents a mix of the hispanic , asian and malayo-polynesian sensibilities . For those who have a deeper interest in Philippine culture , this is a must-get . But also for those who love authentic musics of the world , check this out . You wo n't be disappointed .
 These are the songs and instruments I grew up with - - ALL Filipina grew-up listening , singing and dancing . It is much fun to listen and when you visit my country give topic for casual conversation ... can not talk about weather al time ; - -RRB-
 The whole family enjoys listening to this heartfelt music . It took awhile to receive it , but the wait was well worth it .
 i wii always be her
 Sure to be a Christmas classic ! Played on either handmade or vintage insturments , the tones to their songs are unforgetable !
 Timeless classics played on handcrafted instruments
 Jamie O'Reilly 's new cd is a complete listening pleasure for any Sunday afternoon . I found myself humming `` The Riddle Song '' and singing along to the standard ballad `` Annie Laurie '' . Michael Smith 's `` The Snow Queen '' excerpts and the token `` Waving to Picasso '' from their show `` Hello
 jamie o'reilly is no mere singer . she is a story teller , an interpretator and actress , whose warm and gentle voice brings joy to the listener . Her `` Annie Laurie '' reflects thesoulful singing of generations past.Looking forward to the next album ...
 I love the movie Keeping Mum . The music in it is half of what makes it such a great movie . The composer Dickon Hinchliffe is so talented . Hope to hear a lot more from this guy .
 I have recently purchased the CD of One Elephant , Deux Elephants as the tape I have had for almost 20 years is wearing out . My two-year-old son adores these songs and we listen to it repeatedly.Over the years , these songs have either become classics -LRB- Skinnamarink -RRB- or are traditional childhood songs -LRB- She 'll be Comin ' Round the Mountain ; Twinkle , Twinkle ; Tingalayo -RRB- . Thus , the album continues to appeal to young audiences . Sharon , Lois , and Bram are fabulous musicians and present the songs in interesting ways while allowing their own personalities to shine through . It is amazing to me that this trio recorded this album shortly after they met -LRB- and on borrowed money -RRB- ... and it quickly became a Canadian children 's favourite and rocketed them to fame.The pace is lively and my son asks for his favourites over and over again . Hearing the voices of the child singers encourages him to sing along . I can almost guarantee that your child will love this recording .
 I grew up listening to this record -LRB- and the subsequent ones -RRB- , and I still occasionally pull it out and put it on the turntable . This trio has managed to provide a diverse and high-quality collection of musical arrangements for classic children 's songs . They offer a refreshing alternative to all the saccharine , cutesy and condescending music that is generally offered to kids .
 While I would not CHOOSE to listen to kids songs on tape if I were not trying to entertain children , this selection makes the effort worth my while . The music is either classic or original , but always beautifully sung and executed by these three very talented performers . I love everything by this trio and so does my child . Even at 9 years old , she sometimes still asks to listen to them together because it is so fun to sing-along . A small confession
 For those of you that REALLY know how to dance ... this is a good , slow , sexy Samba
 Like the previous reviewer I have seen Angela Brown and the Mighty 45s live . This is the first time I 've found reference to Angela Brown on a US web site . She may perform sometimes without the Mighty 45s but maybe not in the US at all . If she does a live performance , why is there no web coverage ?
 I saw Angela Brown and the Mighty 45 's live at a small venue and it was simply one of the best performances I 've been at . The CD does n't have the atmosphere but it has the drive , the verve , the energy , the clarity of sound and some very smart songs . I do n't understand how someone can give such a great performance on stage and on record , have such a great band behind her - and not be one of the stars of the moment.If you like a blues performance that rocks along , then you should buy this CD .
 I saw Angela and the Mighty 45 's in London . Fantastic performance . I wish she would release more ... . If you like powerfull female blues - buy this album
 This is some really great hard/dark forest trance . Nice rythmic drum beats , amazing sounds . Tracks 7 and 8 are the best ! Some of the most innovative trance songs I have had the extreme pleasure of listening too . The rest of the tracks are good as well , but these two really get this CD on my favorite list . Amazing !
 Imagine Vangelis with lyrics including progressive and metal elements . What a wonderful mixture giving an atmospheric sound.Softeness of the singing really attracted me on this album , it is so controlled -LRB- voice is a criss-cross of Mark Hollis and Demis Roussos almost -RRB- . Ca n't decide which is my favorite song . Is it `` Fragment of the sun '' , `` Beat the drum '' , `` all or nothing '' , `` hide and seek '' , `` spirits '' or `` ghosts '' ? I 'll leave it to my mood of the day . Excellent purchase .
 I never had heard any material of Pallas before and just stumbled into this band listening to different recommendations in sympho-rock at my favourite CD-store . I was in for a nice surprise and immediately bought this album . Call to Arms opens the album . It 's a powerful rock track with a nice break . A good but rather straightforward track . Beat the Drum is one of the best tracks on the album . This song has a wonderful quiet opening with just piano , string keyboards and vocals . After two and a half minutes a powerful second half starts . The title track features a very powerful bass line and good melodies . A thunderous drum sequence gives the finishing touch . Hide and Seek is a very accessible up tempo song with a catchy melody . Insomniac starts with spooky keyboard and sound effects . Very atmospheric . The powerful second half is based around the bass and guitar riffs . After various tempo and theme changes the song ends with a computerized voice . All or Nothing
 They kept me waiting for more than a decade ... and at last here it is
 I just received this cd , and `` Beat the Drum '' was recorded 2 years earlier than the Cross . It consists of much less progressive rock , but has many good themes . I miss the prog , but still is good . Pallas returned to prog with The Cross and the Crucible . '' The keys and the guitars set up songs differently each song . So they are n't the consistently the same type of song . It still is good rock with a couple of unusual topics . A plus for Pallas .
 I did not like this disc . I just listened to some samples and went on with my shopping . For some reason , this disc was ordered and I sent it back .
 After some limited success in the early 80 's Pallas went on hiatus for more than a decade . In 1998 the band re-formed with new vocalist and front man Alan Reed and the modern day version of Pallas was introduced with this album . This is a good , but not great Pallas album in my opinion . Reed is a very good vocalist and fits in well with the rest of the band . The music would probably be classified as neo-prog with songs mostly on the shorter side , with quite a pop nod to most of it . There is some very nice guitar work to be found here and they keys are all over the place . The lyrics get a bit weighty tackling social and political themes at times . Highlights include `` Insomniac '' , `` Fragments Of The Sun '' , `` Beat The Drum '' , and `` Ghosts '' . Overall this is a very nice reunion album from Pallas , although I think they would get better with later releases .
 Maybe not as strong an effort as some of their other releases but still great . Insomniac is an excellent prog rocker . Fragments of the Sun is a beautiful composition . Great music , good singing make this a cd to enjoy .
 This is a group of progressive rock of the 80 ' . They have two albums before
 This is a great cd ... I love it ... Fowl records is awesome . These artist deserve more recognition than they get ... Get it just cuz Jimi Haha from JCS is on there . I LOVE them ! Have been a fan for almost 5 years now ! Get it !
 This retrospective of Georges Thill should be snatched up by everyone who loves great singing but is unfamiliar with one of the greatest tenors France ever produced ... indeed , one of the greatest tenors the world ever produced . Thill sings with such musicality and style that whatever he sings is filled with passion and comes across as believable.It is particularly gratifying to have examples of his Wagner roles -LRB- in French -RRB- but every cut on this album is a gem.If you love great tenor singing , I guarantee , you 'll love this disc !
 You do n't hear a lot about David Arkenstone compared to some other more well-known New Age artists -LRB- like Yanni -RRB- . But watch out ! If Mr. Arkenstone can continue to produce works as good as `` Frontier '' , he 's going to become well-known amongst all music fans ! -LRB- Not just the `` new age '' set . -RRB- This album has got it all ! Great melodies and superb sonics . Highly recommended .
 This CD and the composer 's Music Inspired by Middle Earth rank as my favorite Arkenstone offerings . Robert 's Theme alone is worth the price of the disc . Check it out . I doubt you 'll be disappointed .
 Little Walter Jacobs does n't seem to get the respect he deserves . Let 's fix that right now
 This is a wonderful CD with a great variety of music types . I like `` Her Garden '' , my wife cried at `` When You Thought I Was n't Looking '' . My two teenage daughters play `` Color of Hope '' and `` Wrap You in Love '' constantly .
 I particularly enjoy listening to this CD as I 'm driving in the car . It 's so peaceful and inspiring . It makes me feel good.A fan from St. George , Utah
 My favorites are May I Serve Thee and Wrap You In Love
 After owning this cd for about a month and a half , i am FINALLY ready to review it . You see , this is a very unusual album , that demands repeated listenings to be fully understood . Here i go . My absolute FAVORITE songs are
 Moby , electronic music hero , is here to save us from all things boring and repetitive . Play just may be the most perfect album of all time . Its folk in the right places , blues in the right places , and techno in the right places . `` Find My Baby '' is a haunting , spiritual that demands REPEAT button . `` Why does my heart feel so bad ? '' is also a spiritual-type song thats done moby style . Fantastic . Just when you thought it couldnt get better , bam , theres `` Porcelain '' , `` Natural Blues '' -LRB- my no. 1 fav -RRB- , and `` South Side '' . The dance is there as well in such tracks as `` Body Rock '' and `` Honey '' . The album that sold cars , offered sitcoms opening themes , and more on T.V. , Play is really what the world needed . Now everyone knows how good experimental/electronic music is . Play remains a staple in my stereo .
 Simply stated , Moby is an amazing talent . The music , instruments , mixing , and vocals are all awesome . For anyone with a good ear and appreciation of fabulous music , this CD is a must in your library .
 A perfect mix of the old and the new , glorious gospel voices from the past mix seamlessly with cutting edge music . High energy dance tracks sit side by side with stunning ballads and ambient mood pieces . This might seem like an unusual mixture of styles but the album has an organic feel to it that makes the track running order seem like a natural progression . Last but not least is the mixture that is the most difficult to obtain , and that is artistic integrity with commercial success and Moby has certainly achieved this . '' Play '' is one of those rare records that is very accessible but still rewards the listener with repeated playing . An exceptional record !
 I have never heard a better album , ever , in all my life . Besides being a huge Moby fan , I personally feel that this was * not * a sellout album ; I think Moby is just naturally moving towards the stardom he has earned and this album is a large stepping-stone in the path .
 This album in amazing and has definitely made me a Moby fan . From the great top 40 track `` South side '' to the jamming sound of `` Bodyrock '' on to the haunting sound of `` Inside '' behind the emotinally turbulent ads of Ireland 's safe driving campaign -LRB- summer and fall 2000 -RRB- Moby has a sound for everyman . This is perhaps the most creative and exciting album to come along in years . It is ever changing , constantly evolving , and certainly not stuck into any peg hole the music industry would like to stuff it in . It is truely expansive . If you do n't like anything Moby has to offer than you probably wo n't like anything at all .
 The last time someone took a handful of old spirituals and blues , and made it danceable , we called it Rock & Roll . And we called that someone Elvis . Okay , so Moby might not change music history , but at least he will go down as the musician who has been cited in the Guinness Book of World Records for producing the fastest single ever.On tracks like `` Honey '' , `` Why does my heart feel so bad '' and `` Natural Blues '' we hear the raspy , aged voices of black singers layered with cool breakbeats . The result is at once fun , mellow and groovy . Though it is essentially dance music , the pathos of the songs is not sacrificed.On some songs , the melody sounds so fragile , you feel like you 're dancing on a frozen lake pressed in on all sides by a bleached out horizon . Which was why the track `` Porcelain '' was ideal for the movie The Beach , manifesting when those blokes lay their eyes on that perfect stretch of paradise for the first time , not aware that this dream is soon turning dark . Moby is not a singer , but he knows how to use his voice , sometimes rapping , sometimes whispering ; on this track he sounds like he is singing a poem . Mixed with his simple beatific piano playing , this is a haunting song that will grow on you.But fear not , there are also rocking dance tracks here with the kind of energy found on his famous remix of the James Bond theme . The first single from this album has been the manic `` Bodyrock '' . Listening to the wall of sound and trying to comprehend that Moby is playing every instrument here , from the distorted guitar to the ambient synthesizer , is an awesome undertaking.I have introduced this album to many . Without exception , they all like it . It does not mean that `` Play '' is generic . It just means that Moby has creatively combined genres in such a way to make it accessible , entertaining and even moving to all who listen .
 I had never heard of Moby . Was sitting in a seedy daquiri bar in New Orleans and heard `` Honey '' . Made it a point to buy the CD after returning to my normal life in the Midwest . Love the song but love others more ... Porcelain , Why does my Heart feel so Bad ? This is fun stuff .
 Many times , I have made the mistake of buying a CD based on the singles released to the radio and MTV , only to find that the singles are the only decent tracks . Occasionally , however , I am rewarded with a gem such as Play . When I made the purchase , I had only heard the tracks Run On and Bodyrock . Was I surprised ! Those two are now my fourth and fifth favorites after Everloving , Why does my Heart Feel so Bad , and Natural Blues .
 This is one of the best albums I 've heard in years ! I love this album so much ! Moby is a musical genius , he always has been . Taking from gospel & soul influences , adding on ambient sounds , and bringing the two together in endless harmony . When compared to some of the music that tops the charts today , this is Earthshattering ! Not only that , but the man is one of the best minds that the world has -LRB- Just read the liner notes -RRB- . Rave on , Moby . Rave on .
 If someone were to tell me I 'd have to live on a deserted island , and I could only have five albums , Moby 's `` Play '' would be among them . The entire album is so rich and textured . Moby harnesses the power of classic tracks , like gospel and blues , with his signature style . Great car music , great club music , just great music .
 I have all of Moby 's albums , and with the exception of the `` Everything is Wrong '' remix album , `` Play '' is my favorite . It has everything , from folk/native indian flavor -LRB- `` honey , '' `` natural blues , '' & `` everloving '' -RRB- to breakbeat/techno -LRB- `` bodyrock '' and `` machete '' -RRB- to softer love songs -LRB- `` porcelain '' and `` why does my heart feel so bad '' -RRB- to ambient -LRB- the majority of the last third of the album . -RRB- If you like `` play , '' I would also highly recommend the `` bodyrock '' and `` honey '' singles . I saw him in concert this past summer and it was one of the highlights of my life . His music truely touches your soul .
 This is the best album I have heard in years ! It has a beautiful melancholy quality , but it is also very spiritual and uplifting . I would recommend it to anyone . I am a graphic artist , and I truly believe it has helped my work to listen to this fabulous album .
 The idea of mixing electronica with old-blues/gospel vocals was truly a powerful statement about the music of the 20th century . The logical conclusion to the `` Big Beat '' genre , Play had every reason to be the most spiritual , ecstatic , moving dance record ever made.Unfortunatedly , Play also exposes Moby 's weaknesses as a DJ -LRB- and his strengths too . -RRB- Mainly , while he 's an admirably eclectic artist , he does n't do any genre -LRB- besides his trademark ambient style -RRB- particularly well . He seems to be content wrapping the samples around , essentially , a 4-piece funk band . Which would be fine , except that often his idea of a funk band does n't swing quite right . Even Bodyrock seems to plod in places . That said , none of the up-tempo songs are bad , and Honey and Run-On do get your body moving . However , I would credit that more to the vocals than the backing.The samples are truly powerful . And when he slows things down , wrapping them in his classic , emotional synth style , oh man , you 'll be holding back tears . Tracks like `` My Weakness '' and `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad ? '' are that good . In this sense , Play really does achieve its ambitions , even exceeding Everything Is Wrong in giving you soul power.The rest of the CD indulges in good , though not great instrumental pieces and bluesy trip-hop with Moby 's vocals . Quite good , though again not as accomplished as the `` real stuff . '' Particularly when you consider that alot of trip-hop artists already sing the blues , so to speak.So , Play is essentially a hit-and-miss affair . Sometimes brilliant , sometimes dull , always challenging the limitations of the genre and Moby 's abilities .
 I must say that Moby 's Play is interesting and creative . And to think that he crafted the whole album by himself . I am revelitively new to this techno/dance pop/DJ genre . Having heard a few Chemical Brothers and Prodigy tracks on the radio and owning the static but infectious Portishead
 Yeah , Moby 's repiddling of the James Bond theme was the coolest thing that ever happened to the piece since Monty Norman wrote the thing way back in the sixties . Sure , sure , Moby 's last album , ANIMAL RIGHTS was an impressive mix of depression and punkness that left you feeling worse than an extra in a spaghetti western . We all know Moby IS the man , and with PLAY , he continues to make music that is just awe-inspiring . PLAY is so addictive , so grand , so beautiful , so blues ridden , so fuh-rikkin cool that we 've had it in our deck since it came out and still have n't gotten tired of it . Our friends , like us , have n't been able to stop listening to it since they bought it , and even though it goes on for well over sixty minutes of your time , it rolls around and keeps things fresh so well that there 's never a moment of `` Allll right , that 's enough . Where 's my Static X album ? '' Want specifics ? `` Honey '' and `` Find My Baby '' kick off the album with bluesy rootsness that makes you realize you 're far away from the proverbial Kansas of ANIMAL RIGHTS . `` South Side , '' `` If Things were Perfect , '' `` 7 , '' it 's all just , man ... get this album . Whatever you need to do to get this album -- short of illegal acts -- do it . You will not be disappointed .
 I was introduced to this album by my brother and was not sure if I would like it as I grew up in the seventies and was therefore somewhat out of touch with today 's artists . But from the opening notes of HONEY , I was hooked . Moby put together a wonderful collection of songs for this album , most of which are instantly memorable , covering rock , pop , ambient music , gospel and ballads . Eighteen songs is a lot for one album and maybe four could have been left off
 Like many , the first time I 've heard Moby 's music was when they used his songs in commercials . And when I got this album , I was hooked . This is fine ambient techno right here . Get it for the songs `` Find my Baby '' `` Why does my heart feel so bad ? '' `` Natural Blues '' `` Everloving '' and `` My Weakness '' these are , to me , the best songs in Play .
 I am a hip-hop fan . I wo n't get into it , but if you knew of all of the other cds I own , you 'd probably be very surprised that I not only own , but like this album . I would actually rate this cd 4 1/2 stars if I could . I really like the smash hits `` Southside '' and `` Natural Blues '' . I also enjoy some of the slower songs on here as well . Also , even though I 'm not a vegetarian or a vegan , I think that Moby has many great views about the world and is a class-act role model . The only reason I took off half a star was because since the album was so long , I just thought that there were some songs not good enough to be on the record .
 Wow !! What can i say about Play except its one of a kind !!!!! There are not many artists who can mix so many different music genres and come out with an outstanding album ! From mellow dance to pumping rock to spiritual gospel , Moby manages to produce an album that gels together seamlessly despite the varied musical spectrum it adopts . For this reason it is such a UNIQUE album . It took time for me to appreciate the quality of Play at first , with 18 tracks and each one having its own character i felt somewhat bewildered by its nature . You really need to keep on listening to it to fully appreciate it , it is a slow burner but in a good way . I find the great albums are ones where the longer u listin to them the better they gets . There is not really one obvious weak track on Play , however I do have many personal favorite ones ` Why does my heart feel so bad ? ' , ` Run on ' , ` Bodyrock ' and ` Everloving ' to name but a few . However , my personal fave and i think a lot would agree porcelain is the ultimate chill out track !! It expresses the emotions of jeolously and remorse with vocals by moby himself . I just love the intro to this song , it really sets the vibe for the album !!!! Top stuff Moby ! Cant wait for the new stuff !!!
 Brilliant music by a brilliant guy . He has original and remixed music that will simply blow you away . Moby is simply the most intelligent musician to come around since REM . He holds the listener spellbound with his mixes , his originals and his beat . Simply put , if you want to hear music that is not built for instant Top 40 , corporately approved , or tweaked by producers and mixers simply to catch your attention on the radio , Moby is for you . Play it .
 If you think about it , Play is a rather strange album . I mean , what is it ? I ca n't really call it techno or trip hop . It 's not really dance or club music either . Sure I 've heard `` South Side '' played on rock stations , but it 's not really rock music . I suppose you can call it `` Electronica '' , but the album seems to have more accoustic instrumentation than anything else.I think that if I had to label Play , the word that most accurately describes it is Pop . It 's really just catchy , infectious pop music - only it 's in the guise of electronic music . No , it does n't have the standard , verse-chorus-verse type structure of a regular pop song ... but then again it does have quite a bit of vocals . All of the songs contained in this album is accessible to practically anyone ... not just fans of electronic music . That 's not to say that this is a bad album . Infact , it 's quite good . And as long as you 're not a Electronica snob , Play has enough depth to hold up to repeated listens . You 've probably already heard the catchiest singles here
 I repeat
 I can say , i was a bit hesitant on buying this cd . i listened to the first couple of tracks at a listening station at circuit city and loved it , but i had heard that his music was labeled `` weird '' and `` underground '' . the truth that it blends every kind of music you could think of into his own way . there is no bad track on this album . from the bouncy `` bodyrock '' , to the southern gospel him -LRB- sooo catchy -RRB- `` Run On '' , or the mysterious enigma-style `` porcelain '' . this album is by far the best album of the year , even beating out my favorite band No Doubt . the best thing is that this IS the breakthrough album of techno . if there were one album that defined techno , it would be this . techno isnt just mindless dance beats in clubs , its more . people 20 years from now will be looking at this album , and still enjoy it .
 This album almost never leaves my CD player . It 's inspiring and fun . Moby 's work has never failed to please me . I recommend this CD to anyone who is looking for something interesting and full of soul . Also , Moby 's liner notes have always made me think , about the world . His essays in this album are beautiful .
 This is a truly edgy , hypnotic display of techno-trip-hop grooves backspun into the eerie cosmos of sound and rhythm . Moby has a masterful gift for song crafting and this is just pure math , formless and metaphysically beautiful . In each turntable spin and moan , groan , wail , echo you can feel the earth move in the world of imagination and soul . An enriching form of melodic dreamscape . Like a neverending dream , you pray no one wakes you up from . Moby entangles you in his universe , his extreme and patient universe with the symphonies of solar systems . He 's speaking the hymns of the spirit , it 's up to you to listen .
 Play is by far the best Moby CD to date , and could quite possibly be the best electronic CD ever . Moby succeeds in creating a harmonious blend of spiritual overtones set against beats that could best be described as deep , laid back , and moving . This has been my essential evening mix for the past six months , and is a collection of songs that will never grow old . It is warming that a keystone in the arch of the electronic music focuses on his Christian roots and religious spirituality . A COMPILATION WHO 'S WORTH FAR SURPASSES ITS MEAGER PRICE TAG
 Moby 's `` Play '' is much more than an album , it is an experience . It 's a flawlessly presented collection of eclectic wonder . From chunky techno -LRB- Bodyrock -RRB- to negro spiritual inspired -LRB- Find my baby -RRB- ; `` Play '' manages to maintain continuity . It is just as enjoyable listened to song by song , or as a whole . Whether your new to the Techno genre , an avid consumer , or do n't like it at all ; this album will have something for you . Also , check out Moby 's other works
 I love this album . Great . But anybody who says this is a great `` techno/ambient '' album is kind of off track . This is `` pop '' techno for the most part . It 's worth getting , but I 'd go for
 I recently had a chance to catch Moby at a dance club . Everyone was jumping and dancing , and the music was great . So I order the CD , pop it in , and it is just as good ! Moby has an excellent talent for music , as this CD shows . No matter what kind of music you like , its a good bet you 'll like this !
 I saw Moby last night at a free concert in Boston
 I thought this CD was very well done . I have n't heard any other of Moby 's sutff , other than his James Bond Theme . Still , despite the people who gave it 1 star -LRB- who I personally think can not take change very well -RRB- I bought this CD after I heard Bodyrock on MuchMusic . And it 's still a damn good CD !!!!
 Moby has taken the difficult task of making blues and other black music into techno music , and he has pulled it off beautifully . With songs as catchy as `` Run On '' and `` Honey '' and as beautiful as `` My Wekaness '' and `` Porcelain '' . This album is solid , it absorbs YOU . Some may bringe at the fact that Moby has commericalized the only un-commercialized genre of music left . However , Moby has done it with class and dignity . For a great album that will take you on a ride - there is no better than this .
 Moby ONCE again has broken new boundries with this album . The man is a genious , and he proves it with every cd release . This one being the most exciting cd to ever be released , because it ventures in to new territories . What happens when the 30 's jazz and blues meets the 90 's techno , trance and ambient . Well , you get some of the most beautiful music moby has ever created in this album play . . MOBY , IF YOU EVER READ THIS , YOU ARE THE MAN !!!!!!! And to the rest , this and every other moby album and single is the most beautiful music i have ever heard . If you never own another cd , the entire moby collection is what you need.Now I will sit impatiently , and wait for his next release .
 Moby 's `` Play '' is one of my favorite albums of all time . It 's definitely my favorite electronica album , and there were so many hits -LRB- `` Southside '' , `` Run On '' , `` Porcelain '' , etc. . . -RRB- off this album that it 's easy to see why . Even the tracks which WERE N'T hits are extremely well done and very interesting . The lyrics especially are surprisingly good for this kind of album . Moby 's voice is n't bad - I happen to like it a lot even if it 's not necessarily for everybody . Every track here is fun and interesting which is ultra-rare -LRB- especially given the number of tracks -RRB- . There 's also a wide-range of emotions , pacing , and genres on display here - several of the tracks sound like they could be from a different artist or album . My personal favorites are `` Run On '' , `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad ? '' and `` The Sky Is Broken '' -LRB- this is a strange song for the album , but I like it -RRB- . I think this is an essential album for ANY electronica fan and I would argue that non-fans of the genre would have a hard time disliking it . Moby struck gold with `` Play '' ! Absolutely recommended!Highlights include : the entire album !
 Moby is more than a genius of techno , he is a genius of music . What he does in this album is so joyful and depressing simultaneously , I just want to listen to it over and over again . The best tracks are Porcelain , Why does my heart feel so bad ? , Southside , Natural Blues , and Run On . And the rest are still amazing songs .
 I got this album for my 14th birthday in November of ' 99 . ` Who the hell is Moby ? ' was the response I got from most people . I played a couple of the tracks for my friends way back when , and they thought it was so strange . I thought it was brilliant . Of course , at that time , you had only heard `` Porcelin '' once in a blue moon then . And `` Bodyrock '' was popular in commercials ... but the absolute best of this album are the piano driven , soulful tracks . `` Rushing '' has always been a standout to me , along with `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad ? `` I especially like the guitar numbers , such as the epic `` Everloving '' . And the last track , `` My Weakness '' , is surpringly powerful , different , and is so ... Moby . I love it.Skip the hit , `` South Side '' , as well as `` Inside '' . I NEVER liked `` South Side '' . I do n't even have the edition with Gwen Stefani on it ... . But considering popular music right now , Moby is the delightful artist , and deseves his fame , rightfully so.Anyway , go buy it . It deserves it 's accolades .
 With over 400 reviews so far it is hard to add much new except to say that this album was easily one of the best of the 90s and maybe the best of 1999 . While Moby is usually classified as dance there are also elements of rock , rap , punk , gospel , soul , blues , and classical in his songs . My personal favorite tracks are Honey , Find my baby , Porcelain , South Side , Bodyrock , Natural blues , Run on , Inside , and The sky is broken . While I think the new version of South Side with Gwen Stefani is a little better , the original album version is still very good . The bottom line is Moby fans will really enjoy this album and I think people who are n't necessarily Moby fans will like it . I was n't a big Moby fan before picking this up , but this album will sway anyone to Moby 's side .
 I 've never been , what I would consider , a huge Moby fan . I 've only recently become associated with him from his work on the `` Saint '' and `` The Beach '' soundtracks . Boy oh boy , do I wish I had discovered this talented individual sooner ! My friend bought this CD and let me borrow it . Although I do n't like the first two tracks , I immediately was hooked in by `` Porcelain , '' which is also featured on the `` Beach '' soundtrack and in a recent Neiman Marcus commerical . I used to think that Orbital was the best techno artist around , but after this CD , Moby takes the cake ! I 've never known any techno artist to put so much feeling into a song , without saying anything . This album gets you grooving and relaxing all at the same time . Some tracks to defintely listen to
 Moby has a long history of being one of the more popular DJ acts on the club scene . His ability to mix all manner of sounds to create some of the most diverse electronica music earned him an ardent , albeit small , cult following . The electronica/techno genre does n't generally lend itself to widespread , mainstream acceptance . In an attempt to attract a much larger audience , Moby executed a unique strategy for promoting his multi-platinum breakout album `` Play '' . As most of the tracks on `` Play '' are n't necessarily what the typical radio program director would consider to be ` radio-friendly ' , Moby got a large number of `` Play '' 's tracks to be attached to television commercials . TV commercials are a medium that does not need to conform to any specific musical format . As a result , these songs were made accessible to the general public , which developed a fervent interest in the songs and the artist . This ingenious marketing campaign led to `` Play '' selling a ridiculously high number of albums . One of the most notable commercials was for Tiger Woods and Nike Golf where Tiger is playing golf all across downtown Manhattan to tune `` Find My Baby '' , track # 2 on `` Play '' . Inventive marketing aside , `` Play '' still would not have found such a mass popularity if it were n't for the fact that is was a fabulous album . `` Find My Baby '' is actually one of the lesser tracks on the album , in my estimation . Moby mixes every kind of beat and mood in his song . He creates the slow and haunting meditative sounds of `` Porcelain '' while creating a body-moving , beat-thumping , dance club favorite in `` Bodyrock '' -LRB- I might add that this is a very good tune to listen to when working out -RRB- . He mixes a cross of blues and techno with `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad ? '' and plays soaring , heavenly sounds on `` Natural Blues '' , arguably the two best tracks on `` Play '' , respectively . Moby even manages to produce a ` radio-friendly ' song that achieved mass appeal with `` South Side '' . Initially just Moby with a non-descript female backup singer , `` South Side '' morphed into something much more when he remade it with No Doubt 's Gwen Stefani as a powerful , opposing female voice on this song . The genius of this album can not be understated . `` Play '' provides hours of satisfying repeated listenings . Moby has definitely ` arrived ' with this album .
 Moby falls into a genre called `` techno '' that has just been broadened with the release of his latest album `` Play . '' More often than not , people will think of techno as just that repetitive , beat-heavy music playing at dance clubs and raves . In fact , techno is just sampling and synthesizing . Moby selects a unique genre from which to sample on this album.Play is about soul and feeling , not something his previous albums were known for -LRB- although there were certainly exceptions -RRB- . Much of it comes from old Gospel songs , as heard in `` Natural Blues , '' and `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad ? '' These two songs , like much of the album , combine a clean , synthetic melody with rusty , bluesy samples . The result is a sound unlike any you 'll ever hear , and it 's wonderful thing.Bluesy , sure . But diverse ? Definitely . The laid back , smooth `` Porcelain '' has a little bit -LRB- but do n't worry -- not too much -RRB- of Pop influence . `` Bodyrock '' has some older rap influence . The haunting , rather sad `` My Weakness '' is a spine-tingling finish to a masterpiece of techno.This is a great album to listen to sporadically . Listening to it all the way through in one sitting might result in a wild array of mood swings . However , each mood would be explored entirely in each of these songs .
 I bought this CD becasue of a few songs I had heard and liked and then found out they were all by the same guy
 Like I usually do , I listened intently to each cut after I bought this album -LRB- by an artist I 'd never heard of but saw highly recommended by many of you amazon.com reviewers -RRB- . My reaction was mixed as I wondered whether the sampling of old blues masters was a rip-off ... or a gift from the past to younger ears that may have never heard the originals . I remained undecided and really not too enthusiastic since what I was looking for was a smoother techno ride ala Underworld . This album went through too many changes . I decided I respected MOBY for his ambitious eclecticism , but passed the CD onto my 19 year old daughter . A month later , bored by most of my other techno CDs , I took MOBY to work and set the player to repeat the album ALL day long at a relatively low volume . Now I was n't `` listening '' as much as just hearing . The repetitiveness of the first two cuts which bothered me at first , turned into satisfying mantra music . To make a long story a little shorter , I kept the CD in my at-work player for days , then weeks . No question about it , although it took me awhile , PLAY is super ! It deserves all the kudos so many have given it . My way may not be your way , but sometimes backing off from `` hard '' listening can make all the difference .
 True , Moby was once considered the `` face of techno , '' having brought some identity to a largely faceless genre of music . * Play * , however , is a bold departure from that format , edging away from the cold , mechanical feel normally associated with techno -LRB- only `` Machete '' and `` Bodyrock '' sound like `` techno , '' and they both seem somewhat out of place on this album -RRB- and retooling electronic dance music for the non-technophile . The first half of the album gives you seven or eight truly distinctive pop songs with funky beats , various arrangements , and an uncommon spirituality not found in most current music . Oh yeah , and it has samples , too - not just your typical James Brown or P-Funk samples but long-forgotten snippets of blues , gospel , spirituals , field hollers , and the like . It 's really an amazing progression of songs that contains more propulsive numbers like `` Honey '' and `` Bodyrock '' alongside bluesy mid-tempo tracks like `` Find My Baby '' and `` Natural Blues , '' and elegant Europop like `` Porcelain '' and `` South Side . '' The second half begins to meander a bit with a dive into ambient territory , but it stills seems to fit into the format established in the first half and offers a change of pace with its reflective instrumentals and spoken-word interludes . Highlights include `` Everloving , '' `` Inside , '' and `` My Weakness . '' It also includes a quirky number called `` Run On '' that oddly juxtaposes an entire song from that bygone era with modern elements , and strangely it works ! Solid from start to finish , * Play * leaves a deep impression and sustains the listener for quite some time . Deep and uplifting , the album will appeal to a broad spectrum of music lovers . It has a balance to it that gives it a commercial quality but also challenges the listener at the same time.This album is a minor milestone in modern music , and imitators are sure to follow . Hopefully , we can expect more such innovation from Moby .
 With inventive sampling from the `` Sounds of the South '' box set - synthesizing the melodic soulfulness of early southern call and response chant/wail/songs , with his signature breakbeats , guitar fills and D E E P bass - Moby has created one of the most haunting , powerful and head-nodding forays into electronic music ever . This is not to say that the variety ends there - Mersey style atmospheric songs like the barn-burner `` South Side '' , or the soft , gorgeous lull of `` The Sky is Broken '' - show Moby to be a great arranger and composer as well as DJ , and make PLAY one of the most enjoyable , lasting disks ever . Body Rock Y' all !
 Five years ago I was obsessed with Britney Spears and not much else . I do n't like her as much as I used to , because I 'm older , but I also remembering loving Moby at the same time . I find this quite strange because I was listening to , essentially , teeny-bopper music and also the amazing music of Moby . Ever since I heard the singles from `` Play '' in early 2000 I knew I had to have a copy of this album . I planned on buying it but never got around to doing so . I saw it on sale last week in a record store and bought it straight away . I had sort of forgotten about the songs from this album , but once I took a listen they all came back to me.I also remember around five years ago I was in school talking to my form tutor and she told me I had to have a copy of this album . She was a really great woman and meant a lot to me through a tough time in my early teens , so I was reminded of how good a soul she was when I listened to this album again . Even thought this album was released in January 1999 , it took a full year to make even the slightest dint in the UK album chart . Once it started climbing , though , nothing could stop it . This album was absolutely huge over here and spent 6 weeks at No. 1 , selling over 2 million copies . The fact that every song on the album has been licensed and used in advertisements or TV shows makes this a familiar sound , so there should n't be too many shocks when you hear this for the first time.I have been very interested in the blues samples that Moby has incorporated into many of these songs . I think the sampling of these soulful vocals is not only haunting but very eerie when juxtaposed with the ambient , modern electronica . There 's a sense of old versus new on a lot of these songs , but they are both tied up by an incredible sense of loneliness ; the music is sparse and diverse , epic and daunting , while the arrangements remain rather simple and chilled.The album opens with the strange `` Honey . '' This samples the blues vocals of Bessie Jones and is a very funky opener . You ca n't really understand what she 's singing , but this adds to the mystery . The instruments are quite heavy and make for a foot-stomping intro . `` Find My Baby '' is a superb song which samples Boy Blue 's ` Joe Lee 's Rock ' . This is quite a repetitive song because the same line of `` I 'm gon na find my baby ! WOO ! Before the sun goes down ! '' is repeated over and over . It 's insanely catchy and stands out a mile because the vocal is just so strong . The guitar is very funky too and the addition of more electronica is very surreal . `` Porcelain '' is probably the most popular song off this album and peaked at No. 5 in the UK . The strange intro soon makes way for a beautiful piano solo and some altered vocals by Moby . This song is so pure and natural , it 's like a flower opening for the first time in reaction to the sun . Very delicate and fragile yet powerful and moving . `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad ? '' is a very sad and sombre song that tells the tale of a man who feels so low because he is alone . Everybody in the world can relate to this song ; even when you 're surrounded by people you can feel completely alone . The vocals are very emotional and the soundscapes that undulate in the background are so poignant . The sharp female vocal-yelp in the background tops off a classic song . `` Southside '' is another incredible song is probably the most commercial song on the whole record . The guitars are quite heavy on this song and work a treat against Moby 's voice in the chorus . I love the idea of travelling through a sort of underworld with your friends . The way the vocals rise and fall also makes for quite an anthemic song . `` Rushing '' is not on a par with the previous five songs but it 's still a great track . The female vocals on this song are incredibly relaxing , accentuated more by the piano in the background . `` Bodyrock '' was used in the credits to Veronica 's Closet , and is a great dance track with some funky lyrics . This song has a very urban , underground feel to it that is of course repetitive but very addictive . `` Natural Blues '' was the first Moby song I think I ever heard . I was in absolute awe at the video starring Christina Ricci , which shows the idea of death and old age . It 's incredibly moving and very emotional . The vocals are very strong here , and this song is a classic that everyone has heard . `` Machete '' is the most upbeat , hardcore song on the album . The beat is heavy and races like blood through the veins . It really gets your adrenaline pumping ! `` 7 '' is seen by many as a pointless interlude , but I really like it . It breaks the album up a bit and has a very eerie quality to it . `` Run On '' is totally not what I expected from this album , because it 's just incredibly strange . The song opens with an up-tempo piano solo and strange blues vocals are soon added . It 's very traditional of the area it 's from in terms of lyrical content and especially the deep harmonising in the background . `` Down Slow '' is another short interlude and yet again I love it . This is followed by the beautiful `` If Things Were Perfect . '' This song is very sparse and alienated with the odd lyrics `` Give me summer ! '' being echoed across the electronic baseline . The record-scratching is also very chilling and calming . `` Everloving '' opens with a soft guitar and some deep humming . This song definitely tries to get across a message of peace , tranquility , and most of all , love . The song begins to open after around a minute with this high pitched tone that rises and rises like the sun in the sky . Definitely one of the most beautiful songs on the album . `` Inside '' is another excellent song that opens with a deep throb that continues on throughout the length of the song . This song is so beautiful and sensual because the beat that rides on the back of this throb is so perfectly aligned . The two dance this unique dance for almost five minutes as a piano joins in at the end to close things . `` Guitar Flute And String '' is probably my least favourite song on the album . It 's still quite interesting though , and the flute brings out thoughts and feelings of loneliness inside you that you never knew existed . `` The Sky Is Broken '' is a very dark and quite unnerving song . The beat is sparse and very direct , as it echoes around your ears and back . Moby 's voice is very content and relaxed , almost dead . The piano that creeps in during the chorus is very atmospheric , as are the ambient strings that come in later on . The album closes with the amazing `` My Weakness . '' This song almost makes me cry , it is so beautiful . I have n't cried to it yet , but I just know it 's going to be one of those songs that I will cry to at some point in the future . This song was also used in Season 7 of The X-Files , and with good reason . This is like the sound of a celestial choir descending from the Heavens , giving us a brief glimpse of the beauty contained within . The reason I feel this is because it 's almost too beautiful to describe , like you 've been trusted with a secret that you feel honoured to be a part of.OVERALL GRADE
 I 've been a longtime MOBY fan , and I was the first kid on my block to purchase PLAY when it debuted in ` 99 . Let me start off to say that if I could pick one CD to loop continuously through my brain , play would be it . There 's a different rhythm and groove to this album than any other-I was slightly taken back by the debut of ANIMAL RIGHTS a few years ago-and I was n't expecting anything groundbreaking . As an electronica -LRB- trance , specifically -RRB- and classical music fan -LRB- nice ecclectic mix , huh ? -RRB- , I found PLAY to satisfy both of my musical needs . Play is the type of album that is timeless , one that you will hear and wonder how you could ever live without it ... and the tunes never grow old or tired . And it provides a hope that despite in this age of homogenius music that there are still promising new sounds .
 Every once in a while , a classic album comes out that nobody really screams about . The hype is low , everyone who loves the album considers it their personal treasure , and then a year later it wins tons of awards and the mainstream public scratches its collective head in confusion and says `` who 's THAT ? `` The most recent example I can think of is Radiohead 's `` OK Computer . '' I think that clearly , Moby 's `` Play '' should be added to this list of sleeper masterpieces.After his last album , the dismal `` Animal Rights , '' Moby strikes back with a beautiful , schizophrenic , emotional album . The grabber for those hearing `` Play '' for the first time is the sampled re-workings of old blues vocal recordings . This is a little gimmicky , but after repeated listenings , the truth of the idea comes to the surface and transcends mere novelty.The beautiful `` Porcelain '' is sad , mellow French pop . The funky `` Run On '' is a study in worship of African American spiritual music . Sprinkled throughout the album are dozens of other musical influences , from rap to hip-hop to rock . No matter what style he 's playing with , though , he manages to layer on to it a film of calm and emotion . There 's definitely a through-line connecting the wildly varying styles of each song.This is one of the most accessible , playable , thoroughly enjoyable albums I 've heard in a long time . Heck , I 'm sending my mother a copy .
 Only a few months ago , I was sitting at a friend 's house and his brother came over , sporting the brand new Moby album , Play . Inside the CD player he put it and away we went . The overall calming , yet sometimes anxious feeling set in and I was entranced by this beautiful masterpiece Moby dubbed Play . The intricate sounds bury you deep in your thoughts and calm your soul . To make a long review short , I 'd say this album is the `` one '' we true fans were searching for . Would it be wrong to say that search is over ? * standing ovation for Moby ` round the world *
 I had only heard of Moby before this from his song `` Oil 1 '' from The Saint soundtrack . One of my friends is responsible for turning me onto one of the ten best CD 's of my 900 + collection . I can not even begin to tell you how great this CD is . Usually `` GREAT '' CD 's have 8 or 9 great tracks out of 12 . Every single track on this album is great . Of course some stand out in my mind like the beautiful `` Porcelain '' and `` Natural Blues '' , and the tropical island reminiscence of `` My Weakness . '' The combination of Old Jazz samples , modern techno beats , and hauting vocals ; works to perfection in creating one the the best albums of all time , OF ANY GENRE ! Moby 's faith seems to play a large part in creating an ethereal ambience of heaven ! You do n't have to be an arrogant sophisocate to like this , just a lover of music . Buy it , and if you do n't like it , I will personally refund your money .
 This cd is one of the most beautiful pieces of work that I have had the pleasure of listening to . I love Moby 's music ! All of the songs on this cd are like a work of art . They are so creative and you could just listen to these songs over and over again ! My Weakness is my all-time favorite song . I could listen to this song forever ! I have already listened to it atleast 70 times now and I have only had the cd for 2 days . I first heard it on The X-Files episode Closure . I instantly fell in love with it . This song went so beautifully with the ending scene of this episode ... I started crying . Mulder has just been looking for Samantha for so long ... I 'm getting teary eyed again thinking about it ! I love The X-Files ! -LRB- I 'm obsessed -RRB- Anyway , I 'm getting off the subject . You 'd have to be nuts to not love this song . This song is so spiritual and dreamy . I highly recommend that you buy this cd ... NOW ! GO !
 If you have narrow , picky taste in music , I suggest you pass on this album.In the decade of massive sampling , Moby takes it to a different level by sampling music that takes its roots in blues , gospel , jazz , and some world music . It 's as if this guy took a trip from the 40 's / 50 's and brought his favorite samples with him to add to 90 's beats.I was intrigued like most people at the various honors this CD received such as `` Top 10 Albums of the 90 's . '' Do n't get that confused with the Top 10 Most POPULAR Albums ... It is not something you will hear on the radio quite often.He 's not like Fatboy Slim if some of you are wondering . It 's not incredibly fast beats , large bass , and huge sound effects -LRB- except Body Rock . -RRB- I was expecting all that but after listening to this album , I would say `` Play '' is more like Beck with a bluesy 40s/50s vibe.If all that interests you , I highly recommend . If not , you will definitely not think it 's the greatest album of the 90s .
 I have just started listening to Mobys music . I have always been a fan of Ambient/techno and was always reluctant to get a Moby Album . Too many times I have tried new stuff only to get burn . This is not the case with Moby . I find the music very origional , and well done . The variety and sheer number of songs guarantee you will get your moneys worth . Amazon has done a good job in giving a variety of music which this album has to offer . 2 favorites will have to be Run on and `` My Weekness '' I only wish it was a little longer . I am continuing my Moby collection after just getting I like to Score , which is another masterful piece of art and soon after I will get Everything is Wrong , which has been recommended to me again and again . I do n't think anyone who is open to new experiences will be dissapointed with this album .
 After having had this CD for about three weeks , I think I understand what Moby is doing sufficiently to write an intelligent commentary that will help you decide whether or not to invest in it and add it to your collection.First , you need to know that basically I am NOT a rock fan , nor am I into hip-hop . My CD collection is centered around new age , ambient , and world music with an emphasis on spiritual , not religious , feeling . However , I do go down a number of side paths from that center.So , `` Porcelain '' drew me to Moby 's PLAY . My first listen to the entire CD was not pleasant . The incessant repetition in three of the first four cuts , and the build up to `` Bodyrock '' which seemed quite hard rock to me were quite irritating at first . And then came the night that I listened , and it all came together.PLAY is to be listened to as a whole . It 's a person 's expression of his progression from a chaotic state of consciousness into a much higher plane . At least , that 's how I hear it . You might hear it differently.I consider six individual tracks to be `` key tracks '' . I 'm not saying they 're the best tracks , because each individual part of this progression is vital to the entire work . `` Honey '' is the perfect opening . Here , you have the repetition that sets the mood for this first portion of the whole . `` Find My Baby '' is a terrific low down blues number continuing an incessant repetition that reveals a limited consciousness . `` Porcelain '' then is a self revelation , a piece that stands alone and yet is exquisitely placed here . The piano work comvined with the percussion and Moby 's vocal makes this single cut the high point of the opus . `` South Side '' speaks of the person 's environment , one he accepts and yet needs to rise above . `` Bodyrock '' to me is the ultimate of chaotic thinking and the easing into `` Natural Blues '' is the beginning of spiritual transformation which continues first through a gospel enhanced period and then continually upward through a sequence of steps.This interpretation of Moby 's PLAY is strictly subjective and my own . I do hope , though , that it tells you what you need to know before you decide to buy this CD or to skip it .
 I 'm sure you 've heard all the hype about this album , and it 's all true . Moby 's `` Play '' album is one of the best musical experiences I 've ever witnessed , and it 's an instant classic . Every single song is good , and each is layered beautifully so you 'll be sure to hear something different each time you listen to it . The songs range from extremely danceable to sweet and soft so you 'll have a song available for whatever mood you 're in . The first half of the album is the most recognizable with such hits as `` Honey '' , `` Porcelain '' , `` Why Does My Heart Feel so Bad ? '' , `` South Side '' , `` Bodyrock '' , `` Natural Blues '' , and `` Run On '' ... Wow , the list of hits just keeps on coming . Another song I really like is `` Machete '' . But the other half of the album is just as good and is worth listening to , although less recognizable . So , in other words , this album is a fantastic value and it 'll have a permanent place in your collection.Also , when I ordered `` Play '' , it came with a `` South Side -LRB- Featuring Gwen Stefani -RRB- -LRB- Edit -RRB- '' bonus CD Single as the album had the original version without Gwen . I do n't know if they 're still doing this , but I got it when I ordered , so it 's a good possibility they still are.I absolutely love this album and I wish I could give it more that 5 stars . It 's utterly brilliant and it 's a masterpiece for our time .
 I had heard of Moby through my intrest in electronica and electronic music in general . I had been exposed to his music hear and there -LRB- more recently due to his foray into music scores/soundtracks -RRB- , but for some reason something always held me back from really exposing myself to his music and buying an album . Then a while back I picked up my first Moby album `` I Like to Score '' because it was basicly a collection of all the music I had had of his through his scoring/soundtrack endeavours . It 's a decent album but did n't thrill me due to the fact that most of the music on it I already had or heard.When `` Play '' came out it sat on the shelf for a long time before I picked it up . Everytime I went to the record store I would look at it but never get it . I 'd read reviews -LRB- Rollingstone Magazine made this album out to be one of the best albums ever made ; I scoffed -RRB- , and eventually it was those reviews that finally prompted me to pick up the album.When I first played it , I wondered if I had made a mistake as the first few tracks played ; they just did n't hit me right . Good thing I have this philosophy of letting an album play a few times before formulating an opinion , because the best albums generally take time to grow on you . And that is exactly what this album is ; one of the best albums I have ever heard . It 's wonderfully varied in style yet always remaining pure Moby . This album 's pretty near impossible to classify as fits into several different genres and yet seems to create it 's own at the same time.This album belongs into any true music lover 's collection.Note
 Moby has expressed himself deeply with music for the productions of various movies . Yet until PLAY , he has not been recognized as a truly original , great artist . His music is his expression towards life . That is why I appreciate it . It does n't have a specific genrie or category , but yet many . Hip-hop , techno , groove , blues , and others . This is a peice of art that you can listen to any time when you are in any mood . I guarantee that . I have not been bored of the cd for about 5 months . I come home from school and listen to it while I finish my homework . No matter what mood I am in , his music fills that space up inside of me . Get this and you will not be disappointed . It will fill that hole inside of you no matter what .
 It 's pretty rare I like an ENTIRE CD , but this one has such a wealth of great songs , that all sound quite different , but somehow work very well together . I 'd always HEARD of Moby , but was never familiar with his work . The other day I was at the local record store , and asked what the song was playing over the loudspeaker . They said it was from Moby 's new album . Then I heard the next song , and decided I had to buy the album . I was glad I did . The only downside to the CD is that the song Bodyrock is so overplayed now , that everytime I hear it I ca n't help but think of a commercial on TV - I think for some kind of car . While I understand that musicians can make alot of money by allowing a commercial to use their music , I think in a way it serves as a detriment to their true fans . Commercializing Bodyrock has just `` ruined '' the song for me . OK , enough of my diatribe . The CD is great !
 This is a great CD . It 's unlike any other in my music collection -- songs usually all sound the same , but * Play * has 18 tracks that vary mainly from blues/gospel to techno , and `` Body Rock '' even has a hip-hop style . My personal favorites are `` Run on , '' and `` My Weakness , '' both having excellent harmony . `` Porcelain '' is another great tune . `` South Side '' has an excellent beat , like pretty much all of the other tracks . All I can say is
 When ever I head ou to clubs the music I find there is often a repeat of the same beat over and over , Moby is a great deal different . Even though there is a great deal of repeat in play it used for a background for experimentation in sound . The repetion is mantra like and soothing , but dynamincs and suttle changes in the music make it great to listen too . I have never heard club music like this before and I will look at more of it with more reverence because of PLAY.Find My Baby is a great song listen to it and you will know what I am talking about.Porcelain is as fine as they come great mantra like vocals that get you by the heart strings.South side is a great deal of perfect drums and shows how MOBY can vary a themeMechete and Run On are his best on this CD . They are wity and stay in you mind after you hear them.My Weakness is a Jem toThere are tons of more great tracks . Great for swaying and danceing to . But cool to listen too .
 The album is breathtakingly beautiful with every song a masterpiece on its own . Some people have complained of bad audio quality . Well , if you 've seen the MTV VMAs 2000 , you 'll know that Moby records the albums himself in his bedroom . And to produce an album like this one , that 's just brilliant .
 The artistry of the music on this CD is unparalleled . The tracks are highly creative and greatly varied . You know when you hear a great song on the radio and you buy the CD , only to find that each track repeats the same style and beat ? Play does not suffer from this affliction . If you enjoy modern and alternative music , you will not be disappointed by Play . I 'd give it a rating of more than 5 stars if it were possible .
 This CD rocks so hard ! It is considdered to be techno ... but there are more mellow tracks on it that are great . I love listening to this CD because it energizes me so much . I clean to it dance around , you can do anything . Moby is just brilliant . There is not really much else to say ... sorry ...
 The first time I heard this album I fell in love . I love different sounding music , and Moby has definitely produced exactly what I rave about . Each of the songs has a different style and if I did n't own the CD I would n't even know it was the same artist performing each song . There is a variety of music types which keeps you intently listening . It 's the only CD that keeps its own place in my CD changer and is definitely the most listened to . You just wan na hear it again and again and again ...
 This is truly a electronic masterpiece and will never been forgotten . I have been a big fan of Moby for quite some time now , but I have found myself skipping a song here or their on some of his other albums . This CD is one of those CD 's you want to leave on repeat all day , and listen to it through and through . On this album Moby remixes a lot of old blues songs , and briliantly brings them to life . He takes electronic music to a whole new level with this album . If you do n't own any Moby , start here . And if you love the smash hit `` Porcelain '' or `` Everloving '' you 'll want to check out his album `` I Like to Score '' as another great Moby CD to own . If you have n't started listening to Electronic music at all START HERE !
 Words can hardly express what Moby has done to music coming into a new decade . Moby has inspired thousands of people to look beyond there normal window of musical vision . Play has turned mothers , fathers , children and other cultures into eclectic music lovers . Music is suppose to move you or reflect a mood and I can tell you Moby has created a masterpeice that has touched many people , myself included . It 's simplistic nature is the true genius and I can not imagine ever getting sick of it .
 The minute I heard Porcelain as the background music for a TV commercial , I knew I needed to have the CD that it came on . What a surprise to find out that I already knew several of the other songs on the album as well . I once overheard someone say that Moby is `` an artist whose music you have listened to often , without even realizing who it is '' and since buying the album I believe this is true.I already knew the songs `` Natural Blues '' and `` Bodyrock '' from radio play , but did n't know the artist -LRB- until hearing them on the CD -RRB- . Then after buying the CD I saw 3 more commercials with this music as background . I think also that `` Why Does my Heart ... '' was used in the HBO show `` Oz . `` I do enjoy the album and appreciate the variety of the songs on it . Some of the songs are a little tedious though , and at times I do n't have the patience to listen to them all the way through -LRB- like `` Honey '' and `` Find My Baby '' -RRB- just because there is not enough of a change in the rhythm.But overall it 's a good album and a welcome addition to my collection . Hope it 's like that for you if you decide to buy it .
 this may be the most relaxing , soothing , calming music i have ever heard . one of the editorial reviewers said it sounded earthy , and while i dont really know exactly what that means , it sounds right . this is worth getting .
 Ok , so you 've probably seen the video or heard the song , `` Bodyrock '' somewhere . That is Moby . But then , there is so much more . Actually , `` Bodyrock '' is a mere fraction of what you will hear on Play . This 18 track masterpiece is a mix of so much music , something new is heard with each listen . However , it is not so complex that it is difficult to listen to . Quite the opposite , this is one of the few techno CD 's one can completely enjoy all the way through . Even the word , techno , seems to insult the CD , because Play is so much more than techno . It is a collaboration of emotion from music into 18 beautiful , but eclectic pieces of music . Songs like `` Porcelain , '' `` Natural Blues , '' and `` Everloving '' are simply beautiful . Meanwhile , `` South Side , '' `` Run On , '' `` Bodyrock `` and `` Machete '' range from fun songs to blazing rock . Treat your senses to a complete immersion in sound and music that will reward you with something new in each listen .
 This album was much more than I expected . I had only known the song Natural Blues and decided to go ahead and buy the CD . I love it because each song is different and the first time I listened to it , I had no idea what each song was going to be like . The songs are deep yet easy to relate to . I definitely recommend this album to anyone . It 's for people of all tastes .
 Well I must say that that this is a plesent suprise . I heard `` Bodyrock '' and thought moby was just another fatboy slim amintreem dancebeat techno artis . Well after hearing and seeing the `` Natural blues '' I found he was more than that . Well its starts with the gospel/hip-hop track `` honey '' . Well at first listen you may not be empresed but it will grow on you . after `` find my baby '' one of the best songs I heard in a long time comes on `` Porcelin '' is amazing . So peaceful and relaxing . The `` why does it feel so bad '' track follows , and is also a powerful song . `` Southside '' is a cool song . You get `` rushing '' which is an istrumental . Then the dacebeat `` Bodyrock '' comes on which is a very rare fast song on this album . The next song is the amazing `` Natural blues '' track . Nuff said . Well `` Machete '' is the fastest and most techno song on the album . I wish there was more . After that , there is a buch of 40 sec songs and songs that he just talks . `` My sadness '' and `` Gutair string and flute '' are great and there are a few other I just wish he would take of some of the pontless tracks like `` 7 '' . Well neverless this is a great album.Standout tracks
 Play gives me the same ` lost ' feeling when I listen to Orbit 's ` Pieces ' . Funny , original , loose and a bit sexystrange , fresh and almost perfect for every situation . But PLAY is a lot deeper than that . These pieces are sophisticated , unmitigated and very smart . The album often frightens me , then I turn it off and wonder when Moby looks serious .
 This was truely an exquisite piece of fine work , my friends ... Moby Play features such a variety of music - but all spirity and awesome ! It will either relax your senses -LRB- this is a good one to listen to in the bathtub after a stressfull day -RRB- or kind of gets you into a belly-dance kind of mood . Anyhow - whatever the heck kind of music you like - you will like this .
 I am pretty much a retro-grouch , there is very little new music that I enjoy . I took a chance on this cd after hearing pocelean and natural blues on the radio . This is the best `` new '' cd I have purchased in years . There is n't one bad track on it . Exceptionaly conceived , musicianship and production value . I probably should give it 5 stars but I hold that back for that one in a million release . This is a very beautiful album .
 I must say that I will have to try and explain how much I love this CD in words . His songs are really uplifting but relaxing at the same time , making his music an amazing paradox in itself . Moby is one of the great unrecognized talents of our time that everyone can enjoy . Thanks Moby .
 If I could describe Play in one word , that 'd be the one I 'd use . This album has garnered SO much attention from the media , normally unheard of for a techno CD . But , there are always exceptions . Let me tell ya , all the hype and talk about it is well-deserved . This is Moby 's Mona Lisa , perfection that will be held as an example to all who come after it . There all many great techno acts out there , from new guys The Lo-Fidelity Allstars , to the virtual fathers of noise-techno the chemical brothers , to Vegas ' own Crystal Method . Moby has been around for 7 CDS and about a million b-sides and bootlegs , but it 's with Play that he got to that place few artists ever go . The Beatles were there when they made Abbey Road , Mariah Carey with Daydream , Green Day with Dookie . Now Moby has achieved that creative high . This album is amazing . It 's the ultimate party album , with few -LRB- if any -RRB- kinks in it 's armor . From the spritual Natural Blues , to the funky Honey , to the hip-hip Bodyrock , to the nostalgic bluegrass that is Run On , this is a CD you NEED TO HAVE . Favorites , besides those 4 I mentioned , are Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad , Porcelain , and the absolutely haunting My Weakness , this is the best album of 1999 , hands down . Also , pick up I LIke To Score , if for no other reason than Moby 's genius remake of The James Bond Theme .
 If you like your music to sound all the same , this is * not * the album for you . Moby 's `` Play '' is a very eclectic mix of styles from soulful to rock that does not apologize for its eccentricities . I had heard `` Bodyrock '' on the radio and did not think much of it , until I heard it in concert with the rest of the album . This is definitely an album which demands several replays in its entirety . It demands to be a favorite rather than just picking out the special songs . The only thing I missed with this album is that the words were not included . If you really like music of many varieties rather than just one , BUY THIS ALBUM !
 this is the best cd of this year and possibly the next 100 years ... Moby is in a class all his own
 this cd was not what i expected . i bought this because i liked gwen stefani in south side , but thought that the rest would be dumb techno ... -LRB- dirty vegas -RRB- . But i liked alot of it because there are some good beats -LRB- porcelin -RRB- , some good piano -LRB- why does my heart feel so bad -RRB- and some good gosple -LRB- natural blues -RRB- . overall this was prety good for techno .
 It 's friggin ' brilliant . Just buy it .
 I bought the cd after only hearing just a few songs and I absolutely loved them . Since then I 've shared the cd with my friends and family who love Moby now too . I have been meaning to buy more of his music , but I listen to this so much , I do n't bother . This is one of my favorite cds of all time ! I love Moby !
 Wow , Moby 's Play is an awesome cd if you like music at all . Moby is a genius with `` Porcelaine '' , to `` Everloving '' , IF you like music then get Moby 's play .
 I got hooked on Moby through hearing his songs on TV commercials . Maybe a sad commentary on our times , but I are grateful to be introduced to his music , and I 'm sure he 's grateful to have his record sales rocket . Consistently moving but also eminently danceable , Play is one of my favorite discs . I have it nearby at all times .
 i think this must 1 of the best cds i have brought this century defiantly a must buy !
 Moby has never really been one for musical styles , techno , rock , punk , folk , jazz -- who cares , it sounds amazing . `` Play '' is hard to place , because of its sound . The blending of '30s folk and gospel vocals , through breakbeats , it is a convergence of everything . An amalgalm of all music .
 So I 'm slow ... this is the first Moby CD I 've listened to . But what I lack in speed -- or should I say , trendiness ? -- I make up for in endurance . This CD travels constantly between my car and privately owned espresso business , not to mention that it 's recorded onto my computer 's jukebox . Moby layers his rich electronica with heartfelt lyrics , haunting synth-sounds , and spiritual questions . He gives soul to his concoction of throbbing dance beats and multiplying textures of sound . He strips off his shirt to bear his heart ... and let 's it beat loudly for all to see . And hear . The pulsing repetition is only a backdrop to this looping soundtrack of life .
 WOW MOBY IS 10 TIMES BETTER IN CONCERT _ - MOBY CAME TO BUFFALO NEW YORK AND ROCKED THE HOUSE DOWN , HE IS A MUST SEE , TECHNO AND ANYTHING U WANT , EVEN RQUESTS WOW MOBY IS THE MAN !
 I am a true DJ fan , as I am one , and strongly urge everybody out there who is in the whole techno scene to buy this CD . Coming from working in Flordia was my first chance to experince Moby , as he was popular in many of the clubs . With a nice spin , and more than exceptional mixing , this is one of the best cds that I can use in my mix .
 This has to be Moby 's best work . I especially enjoy Run On it 's different than Moby 's usual songs but it 's grrrrrrrreat . I highly reccomend this CD I know you will enjoy it .
 absolutely outstanding ! moby has excellent variety in this CD . tracks 2,3,4,8,14,16 , and 18 are my favorites . a must for any techno/new age music fan . if you do n't have it , you do n't know what you 're missing ! also , try Vast , another great new age band .
 I just heard them on 54th Street West they are awesome to say the least . . had to have to cd . The sounds send me . The mix of hip-hop and fusion rock is not to be believed ... totally to be had . My personal favorite `` Natural Blues '' brought me out . They 're fresh and I 'm 46 babies hear them .
 Reading through Moby 's collection of short essays included in the MOBY 'S `` PLAY '' CD booklet , you feel Moby 's perspective on mood , depth , and inner peace . Especially , the piece on MOBY 'S PLAY CD Track # 3
 This CD is really great and has lots of things going for it . The sound is awesome and has enough variety in it that you really do n't get bored listening to it , even if this is the only CD you listen too . Bodyrock is a great song to just get you up and moving and the haunting sound of My Weakness is truly emotional in its reach . Moby does so much with sound to evoke emotions that it is truly amazing , I 've never had a CD that just inspired emotions in me where I could n't figure out why those emotions were being evoked but this CD manages to do it at times . My only complaint is that there are some tracks on here that just are n't nearly as great and that I find myself skipping , but overall this is a monumental piece of work .
 Moby 's latest album touches on many genres of music , and it sounds fantasctic . Instantly recognisable tunes hit you , and no wonder companies are queueing up to have his music play on their adverts . One of the best things about play is the number of songs on the album , a massive 18 ! It is guarenteed that everyone will like most of the tunes , because of the contrast in styles . If you buy one album this year , MAKE IT THIS ONE
 How often do u find an intelligent and articulate artist who mixes spirituality and electronic music successfully . Not often , but here 's MOBY whose artistry brings you a range of music influences from electronic to gospel to trip-hop all rolled into one excellent CD ! All these being done without the preachiness ! Check out his catalog of oh-so-excellent CDs . NOT JUST THIS ONE !
 Simple concepts , simple concepts ... What seems like a crazy idea - taking old blues recordings and setting them to hip-hop and techno beats - turns out to be the most inspired musical concept of the year . I realize saying that in a year that actually saw the Backstreet Boys and Emmeniem praised as the height of pop genius seems like a backhanded compliment , but a giant 's still a giant , even in a year of pygmies , and with PLAY , Moby has established himself as the foremost DJ and pop producer on the planet . Even those who loved EVERYTHING IS WRONG will be surprised by the inventiveness and raw emotion on display in the new album . Moving , funny , fatal and always , ALWAYS a slave to the rhythm , PLAY takes you on a journey through a blown-out sonic landscape , full of emotional wreckage and chaos at every corner . But in the hands of Moby , the journey becomes a joyous one , and I defy any listener not to smile after listening to PLAY . Not only the best album of the year , but the most important slice of hip-hop in a decade .
 Moby , whom many would consider to be the father of modern techno , comes back again to show us how its really done . This cd is n't a hardcore listening experience , but rather it is something very percisely crafted . Moby has a way to take what would seem nothing more than odd noise , put it all together in a way that no one else can seem to match , and not only make it something you can throw on at a party , but something that is thoroughly listenable in all respects . Hats off to the man who continues to amaze me with his talent .
 This is no hardcore techo album , but has many great tracks . Thorougly recommended for those wishing to experiment !
 Moby 's CD is awesome . The mix of Techno , and Blues is someting that has n't been done before . Blend the samples in Moby 's style and you have an excellent album . `` Play '' is Moby 's best work ever . . `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad '' is one of the most touching tracks , `` Natural Blues '' is one of the most fascinating cuts . `` Run On '' if promoted right , could be a great radio hit.I give the CD four stars . It would be a perfect CD , but I feel a few songs did n't mix well on the album . `` Bodyrock '' is one of them . To have a wonderful album of great samples of Blues , Black Gospel , and Techno . . Then all of a sudden throw in a weak rap/techno tune for the MTV crowd is beyond me . .
 Heart-Warming Masterpiece ... It takes some time to get used to ... but this one grows on you ...
 I find that too often in the techno genre the artist gives no real soul to the song , no filling . Moby has changed that . Moby has made some of the most emotional music I have ever heard on this album . Haunting lyrics and blistering guitar work along with a great beat combine to form one of the beast albums I own .
 One of the best cds that I have ever purchased . Also check out ` Everything is Wrong ' which is even better -LRB- this one is hard to top -RRB- . Moby is one of those artists that you never grow tired of listening to . See him live if you get the chance as well . You can feel his emotion in each song that he puts together . Probably the most talented dj/artist by far ! I 'd give this cd 100 stars if I could . Buy it !
 Moby is a great tool in the transition of mankind . He is one of many present day philosophers who are slowly gaining momentum in morphing the branded mindsets of us all . This album further exploits this momentum by making an album that has multiple songs that are the Chronic for people of any age and background . And to anybody who says they do n't like this music , that 's cool , but I say it 's time to stop saying what we dislike and start makin the things we have learned to like a lot better.P.s . If you have no idea why I consider Moby a present day philosopher , then you should buy one of his albums . He writes a huge hypothesis on life in every cd he brings out .
 Moby rocks ! Do n't stop cranking out the music , Moby ! from the original Mill City ...
 I got this CD because my friend has been raving about him ever since `` I Like To Score '' . So I thought since this was # 1 at the Virgin Megastore , I 'd check it out . I ended up like the first track , so I bought it to further listen to it . I listened to it , and it was kind of boring , until Run On came on . Run On is simply a masterpiece . One of the best songs this year . This whole album is worth it just for Run On . But Honey and Bodyrock are also very good tracks . But almost the rest of it is kind of boring , but it is still a great CD .
 Ever since I bought Moby 's CD , ` Play , ' it is all I will listen to . I bought it expecting to hear some great techno dance music that I have come to expect from Moby . Moby gives his listeners some good industry-standard techno tracks , such as `` Bodyrock , '' but in addition , he provides his audience with a wonderful sampling of spirited & jazzy songs that brought me quite literally to a higher level of listening . Songs like `` Honey , '' `` Natural Blues '' and `` Run On '' quite simply make me happy to see that a techno artist is willing to try something new . What Moby has produced is one of the most innovative and moving CDs on the market . This is among the best albums I have ever purchased , and I recommend it to anyone interested in experiencing something new in the music world of techno .
 This CD is incredible , and it gets better with every listening . The music will blow you away . My favorites are Porcelain , Why does my heart feel so bad ? and Inside . The essays are great , too .
 Rarely am I treated to such an eclectic mixture of sounds
 As a 50Something grandmother , I have been searching for music that transcends all ages , and this one is wonderful . I love the rythms and blends of styles !
 For some strange reason , I have n't seen any bad reviews . It 's nice to know people like the same kind of music as me . Moby 's `` Play '' is the first album I 've ever bought by the artist . If I had never seen him on MTV or Space Ghost I probably never would have bought the album . This is the second best electronnica album I 've bought in a long time , right next to Norman Cook 's `` Better Living Trough Chemistry '' .
 The first thing I do when a new mobius cd comes out , after spending ten minutes getting that impermeable sticker-thing off the case , is delve straight into the ESSAYS printed on the insert . If you have n't checked them out , well , run along and do so right now . The melvillian has something to say to you who would listen.Oh , and its the best cd i 've bought all year . I almost blow my speakers out playing ` find my baby ' on my way to work every morning . Keeps me smiling all day long . Thank you , moby , from all of us `` critiquers '' who were so moved by your album that we had to write the world about it .
 This CD is the bomb ! Do n't believe the nay-sayers about this album , I 've had it for 3 days and ca n't stop listening to it.Moby once again smashes preconceived notions about what his music `` should '' sound like , and busts a move into early blues / folk tunes , smacking some phat flavor into them with techno / punk sensibilites.A great album !
 Come on , what did you expect from one of the most hyped techo albums of 1999 . What was really cool , is this time he uses the blues in this work .
 Certain cd 's that come along in our time that not only captures are spirit with the vibe but also captures our soul.This cd manages to do both.i cant even get over how awesome this cd is . If Norman Cook is good than Moby is a genius . In fact Fatboy Slim is not even in the same league as Richard Hall.Forget commercial success `` Praise You '' because this cd has `` Run On '' and `` Honey '' . A far more intelligent piece of music , blending in piano , and all sort of different instrument.On moby 's new cd , he decides to get away from Rock and go to hiphop . This cd further confirms Moby as a musical genius which was establish from `` Everbody is Wrong '' . To regonize the genius of this album , or even to enjoy this album , you must have a least a small diverse music taste.I dont think i can find any standouts . Every song is good . I bought the last copy of this cd which was selling like Hotcakes when i went to buy it .
 Moby once again takes us on a musical journey , where blues mix with techno and gospel mixes with ambiance . The result
 To be honest , what I heard of Moby i was n't that crazy for , but bought this one on a whim , and it has n't left the CD Player since . The seamless integration of styles on this album is amazing , and this is a disc that any music fan would appreciate -- if you ca n't find the money , steal it , recycle cans , anything , just get it ! You wo n't be disapointed !
 this is great cd . i think this cd belongs in everybodys cd collection . i have two words for ya buy it
 i dont know moby s music but i have kistened only natural blues and why does my heart feels so bad?and they are the best songs to relax ! so long dudes moby 4 ever
 Worthwhile . You should own it .
 Very good CD , it makes me think about everything and its good when your working or when your sleeping . It have one or two `` bad '' songs but the rest are top quality . `` My Weekness '' always makes me think and put me in good mud . And if you enjoy the essays of Moby , then you 'll love it ! I advice you to buy it ...
 I bought 3 CD 's today , the new Smashing Pumpkins , the new Creed , and this album . The only one that caught my ear from the beginning is Play and I literally played it the whole way through on my first listen -LRB- a rarity for my MTV addled mind -RRB- . Great CD !
 Moby music is awesome . I pity the fool who does not like it . If you do n't have it , buy it !
 This CD is absolutely INCREDIBLE !!! This is the greatest Moby disc ever ! From incredible tracks that make me think about everything , such as `` Guitar Flute & String '' , `` Natural Blues '' , and `` Pocelain '' -LRB- which is my favorite MobySong ever -RRB- , to fun jumpy tracks like , `` Honey '' , `` Bodyrock '' , `` Machete '' , and `` Find My Baby '' . Not to mention the classic track `` South Side '' , featuring Gwen Stefani . If you like Moby , buy this CD ! If you like quality music , buy this CD ! If you appreciate life , BUY THIS CD !!!
 Moby 's best album up to date -LRB- when 18 yet relieced -RRB- . Great ! There 's only one thing to do when you havebought this album ; Play it , again and again!After a year you have probably had ALL the tunesas your favourite , some weeks each.Even though there 's not really a connection between the tunes , I think all of them is amazing good music.It has sold 9 million copies.So why do n't try it?Harold . -LRB- became Moby 's biggest fan after buying Play -RRB-
 The best thing about this disc is the great `` rants '' -LRB- or essays-whatever -RRB- that Moby writes in the liner notes . Being neither a Vegan nor a Christian I still enjoyed reading what he had to say ; the man is coherent!This was my 1st introduction to Moby . -LRB- Actually that one song on the Gone in 60 sec . sndtk was ... I digress -RRB- . I Think its a terrifically solid CD and a good intro into what Moby is all about . If you think you might like Moby , also check out 18 and I like to Score .
 The first song I ever heard of Moby was his techno remix of James Bond . Since then I 've been hooked on his music , and he certainly does n't disapoint on this great album . One thing that Moby has , is a unique sound . He will never sound old , or his style of music will never be used by others , because no one could copy Moby . It is n't Rock , nor techno . it 's something in between On this album , all the songs are strong , but in particular I think the song `` why does my heart feel so bad '' is the best . It pours out the most emotion without a doubt . It was used in the trailers of Black Hawk Down , and was used perfectly . Overall , if you are a fan of Moby , Buy this album !!
 Moby is extraordinary and in his full glory on an album like this - one that showcases the best that disparate forms of music can offer transmuted through the hyperkinetic , masterful , playful channel that is Moby.Moby proves that there is hope for electronic music and it comes from the mind of a real musician . With Moby , the medium is the message and he gets really out there to give you what you want as a listener . His performances are flawless and recently he 's been paying respects to those who influence him , namely Bowie.You got ta love this guy .
 Well , what can I say about this CD that has n't already been said ? It is unbelievably good from start to finish . Moby is a genius , and I am eagerly awaiting the new CD , especially since it is rumoured to be similar to `` Play '' . Do yourself a favor and buy this CD if you do n't already have it !
 there is not a single track on this album that i do n't like . the album can be described a modern classical music so all of u hard working people who like to listen to some relaxing music with excellent composition and short but meaningful lyrics , this is the album for you . I cant say more than that . is there anything u americans are bad at ?? i thought us euripeans led the way with dance music
 Play is probably the best album I 've ever heard in my life , though I admit I was n't too happy about the song Honey when I first heard it . The brilliance falls into place when you realise that the looping vocals and the background pianos are n't done in the same studio all at once . Find My Baby is okay.Arguably the best songs on the album are Porcelain -LRB- one of the most beautiful songs I 've ever heard -RRB- , South Side -LRB- ditto , but only for the Gwen Stefani version -RRB- , Everloving -LRB- a three minute instrumental piece that blew me off -RRB- , and My Weakness -LRB- which sounds like a group of children singing -RRB- . Creating your own music is good , but remastering other 's into a masterpiece is better .
 Moby has been in the music biz a bit in the electronica circuit a bit . He tried his hand at `` Rock '' ... BIG MISTAKE ! His debut album with V2 Records breathed new life to the artist Moby and kaching ! ching ! on his best selling album to date `` Play '' . At least half of the music on `` Play '' may have been used in popular 30 second commercials , and used in movie trailers . Other than that , Moby 's music on `` Play '' will get you hooked . He is a wild innovator and I look foward to his newest confections of goodies that await in `` 18 '' coming in May 2002 .
 I found this album to be exceptional , and I know it is hard to find an album as good as this one , since it has an ultimate dance party for the listener . If you love to get up and dance , as well as play around , Moby does it in his `` Play '' album , a must have !
 His best to date . Love the entire CD
 This new Moby album is the best one so far . No doubt about it . He is amongst the best within the art of dance music ! I 'm not what you may call a typical dancefloor listener , but this cd makes me rock whenever ... It 's also the most commercial cd he has made . Check out the previous one
 There are songs on this album that are among the best I have heard in years . They are classics and will still be played and enjoyed 25 years from now . I count `` Bodyrock , '' `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad '' and `` Find My Baby '' among them . The superb songwriting , sampling and musicianship on these songs will appeal to both hardcore techno/ambient fans and more traditional rock/pop fans.Unfortunately , there are a few mediocre tracks that force me to give it only four stars . A little editing , and this would have been a near-perfect five-star 13-song album . Still , this is a must-have for any music fan .
 Moby finally achieves his potential , on Play he gathers everything he has done before together -LRB- ` cept maybe the thrash -RRB- and blends it into an excellent , ecclectic chill out album . The stand out track -LRB- why does my heart ... -RRB- is a perfect partner to the greatest dance tune of all time - Massive Attack 's beguiling Unfinished Sympathy
 After 600 reviews praising this Moby 's work it 's hard to add anything here . Yes , these are beautiful songs ... At least most of them . I just want to give you one suggestion - if you live in a scenic region like I do -LRB- Pacific Northwest -RRB- just take your car out on a freeway during a the time of low traffic , and start driving somewhere while listening to the song `` Evervolving '' . This is my favorite and I still remember driving in Yellowstone NP while listening to it - this is one of my warmest memories ever .
 I just received this album over half an hour ago , and I can say it 's definitely one of my favorite Cd 's to own . It 's very peaceful , calm , and comforting , while Machete reminds me of Tron , with it 's upbeat tempo and vocals . This is an album I 'd listen to while driving in Manhattan at night , or on a rainy day . Ca n't recommend this enough.Key Tracks : PorcelainInsideWhy does my Heart feel so Bad?My WeaknessGuitar Flute & StringDown SlowEverloving
 I enjoy Moby 's unique music . Very soothing and takes you to another place . I 'm ready for the next one !
 It 's timeless . One of the few CD 's that I can listen to fully , for hours on end . It offers enough variety to keep me interested while doing routine tasks , so I can listen while working . The sounds just makes me feel good ... especially ` Porcelain &#34; .
 Heather 's review says it all ... 'm not typically a fan of this kind of music but I love this album and would recommend it to virtually anyone - no matter what your taste ... buy it , you 'll like it . `` Heather | 88 reviewers made a similar statement '' . This expresses my feeling exactly . I am not big on this genre , but this is an album that anyone will love once they start listening to it . Its the Exile On Main Street or Sgt Pepper 's of its genre . Poreciln is simply gorgeous and otherworldly . The whole album was truly unique when it came out . Its owes little or nothing to any previous artist . I love it !
 I went out and bought this album after hearing a few downloaded clips and reading some of the reviews , and I am so glad I did . I have only had this cd for one day , and i have already listened to it about 5 times . It is amazing , like the amazon review said , Moby does things on this album that few d.j. 's can do , that is make an album with so much soul and heart . If your looking for something to dance to with great beats , i suggest you look elsewhere . There are a couple of tracks i would consider just plain fun tracks , something you could dance too , but for the most part this is a journey album . If you are a music lover , even if you do n't like techno music , i suggest you give this album a chance and you will be pleasently surprised by how much feeling and soul is in this album . Thank you Moby for making a cd that shakes the notion that techno ca n't have real soul , real emotion in it . His politics may be annoying to some , and he certainly makes no attempt at hiding them , the album jacket contains several essays on topics from being a vega to the treatment of prisoners . But his music can be loved by everyone .
 His name is not Moby for nothing . Underlying the irony of `` Play '' Moby knows he is being hunted by Ahab . Like few people he agonizes between the ties of the body and the call of heaven , always trying to pull off a reconciliation . We are angels with one wing always searching , searching for that other half so we can fly . But creatures with one wing can only fly in a circle . Hence the deep melancholy in many of the cuts . Even on the cover he is trying to leave the earth but by the end of this work he stands mute on the back cover . Then again i could be wrong , what do you think JD ?
 if anybody that reviews this album has any respect for moby and his talent , then this album should never achieve less than four stars . yes , moby does stray from his more techno-oriented background , but i think he really shines with this album . it is beautiful and fun and meaningful all at once . he clearly could care less whether we like anything about him , being his music , his views or his lifestyle . he states that in the liner notes . this album is flawless . i think that he should be praised for this album , if only for the magnificent sampling . but there is more to this album than sampling , which is more than i can say for a lot of techno artists/djs in the scene right now . moby clearly loves music , or he would n't be so creative . give him a break , why should he stick to techno if he does n't want to . everything is wrong was very very right , and this album is even more so . appreciate it .
 I was browsing amazon tonight and was surprised to see this disc ranking # 9 overall ! I picked this up when it came out in June -LRB- with tremendous excitement as the singles we great ! -RRB- . I did n't realize it was doing so good ! It is nice to see something this different from typical popular music be doing so well . Great for Moby too , who is a really great , interesting fellow -LRB- I need to find out if these MODs I have that say Moby in the sample lines are really * his * ? -RRB- -- Read the essays and quotes too !
 An amazing recording . Congratulations Moby ; thank you for the moving music and for the enlightening essays .
 Moby has done it again . Making steady changes from CD to CD and continuing to keep an audience of wide opened ears ! PLAY may contain concepts that have been used in the past -LRB- i.e. past lyrics used in new tunes -RRB- , but the musical creations surrounding these vocals of so long ago are superb ! The Moby collection has been bumped up a notch with PLAY . For those who question the perfection of this CD , at least see MOBY in concert and you 'll soon change your mind . Watch the music come to life ! Moby will lead the electronic scene into the new Millenium without a flaw !
 One of the most beautiful cd 's i 've heard in a long time
 This is a truly remarkable and wondrous recording . Pay no attention to the naysayers . This set of recordings shows amazing breadth and versatility and every single track is a gem . Get it . . get it now .
 From the point of view of a producer - this album is a masterpiece . The official amazon review -LRB- posted above -RRB- is right on the money ! As for the next review - sure , fat boy slim is more top 40 oriented , but that 's not the point here . Do n't buy this album thinking you 're going to hear a ton of radio hits - buy this album knowing you 're taking home a truly superb work of musical art . -LRB- of course , it 's fun to kick tha ' jams on `` Bodyrock '' too !! -RRB-
 I fell upon PLAY by accident , but now I consider it to be one of my best purchases ever , as far as music goes . It does n't matter what mood I 'm in , because there is a song on Moby 's album that is perfect to match or counteract it . Like so few albums , it has a distinct and unique sound , but is so versatile that if I had to live with only one cd the rest of my life , and I knew it would have to help me through good and bad times -LRB- as truly good music should be able to do -RRB- , this would be it . There is a genius blend of electronic sound and likeable old-fashioned tunes that work together to not only provide pleasure to the ears , but also provide an insight for listeners into the mind of Moby himself .
 After listening to Paul Oakenfold , John Digweed , and other prominent Trance/Techno/Club DJ 's , no one brings out more from all that music has to offer than Moby aka Richard Melville Hall . While I have gone through myraid CD 's some of which are Electronic 's best like Oakenfold 's Tranceport and others , Moby brings out the best of mixing trance , powerful refrains , and awesome sounds . He even adds other components like alternative , gospel , and indie punk . But do n't be intimidated , his music is not bullshit by adding these components , it 's all good . Check out the songs for yourself on Real Audio , trust me cuz I 've heard it all , everything from Trance to Punk , Moby is for real , he 's been in the industry for years , and this CD is the cream of the crop . He does a great job , as nearly every critic says this is his best CD yet and will remain the best . Moby is music , and I 'm sure to have this CD in my CD player for a very long time .
 Track # 2 & # 17 are definitely my favourites bringing manly sounds/lyrics representing the hunting for love/sensual feelings . A great piece of eclectic sounds . Buy the maxi CDs too . They contain 2 great tracks ideal for a rainy sunday afternoon in bed ...
 Moby is truly unique . I just found about him channel surfing and watching Space Ghost . Of course , they did n't whether he 's a musician , comedian , writer , or some guy that was manipulated into going on that show . From what I 've heard from other people , he has a long history of being a great musician so I 'll be sure to check out his other albums .
 This is an awesome musician , what I like about `` Play '' is that there is a song on it for whatever mood I am in . I am glad I picked this one up , you should pick it up too !
 Moby did it again ! He surprised all of us with another excellent cd with the best music in the world !!! The hits i like the most are
 This is a very good disc . It has a mixture of styles and sounds that only Moby could put together so seamlessly . You can tell it is not just music for the masses . He puts his own heart and soul into the music . It is a shame that only a relatively few of us know and understand the significance of Moby .
 Moby 's new album is , like much of his previous work , a creative masterpiece . It is not , however , the cathartic workhorse that `` Everything is Wrong '' is . Which is okay , but the lack of overall unity among the pieces is what keeps it from being a 5 star album . Much has been written on the web about the sampled field recordings , and some these songs are so good they just make you squirm . But the tracks that do n't use these samples should not be neglected . Many of them are beautiful , complex , layers of work . This disc will remain in my disc changer for a very long time . The album is deep
 This album combines the cool grooves and beats of Everything Is Wrong with the trippy half of Animal Rights , and is a real evolution for Moby . Awesome !
 I do n't quite understand why the reviewer has a problem with sampling . Personally I think artists like Moby and Fatboy S. are geniuses when it comes to it . Recordings that were long lost in the world record are given a new soul and depth , revitalized into something that fits today . It 's better than a re-tread of a song any day . Moby and Fatboy are masters at making the vocals they sample part of the song instead of just another C&C - esque looping background vocal . I personally like sampling in my electronic music , so whatever Moby does with it is fine by me .
 Moby is truly a unique artist . I couldve never thought that id b bopping my head to remixed , updated techno versions of blues ' songs , but here I am doing exactly that . Some great little ditties are on this album . Only complaint is that he couldve cut 4 or 5 weak tracks which are present towards the end of the album to make it smoother , yet I still cant complain . Album is tres cool
 I listened to 30 second clips of every song on this CD that this website would let me and I was dissappointed because I REALLY wanted to hear that pretty song on that one car commercial . I really like that song but I do n't know what it 's called or anything else about `` Moby '' except that he or that band is totally warped and psycotic ... Although these charateristics may seem too vile to display the overall effort put into this CD being noticible ; I feel that a 5 star rating thoroughly represents the talent and foreward recognition of this wonderful band . Figuratively Speaking
 great cd . moby is a great guy at singing . the songs `` bodyrock '' and `` honey '' are great . moby is a mix of blues pop and rock . I am a big fan of limp bizkit but moby if getting up there . so you should buy this cd right away . hope you like my review .
 Moby is an awesome , creative musician . His music is tops in almost every review , and he 's a platinum selling artist . A lot of his sequencing is done by computer . His computer of choice ? Why the computer of choice for creative people everywhere , a Macintosh .
 ... that so many are closed-minded and unwilling to change . I read some of these reviews and chuckled lightly . One person complained of formula . Romans 2:1 says that we judge others because we do the same thing . If you think this is formula , I 'd venture you are disappointed because you seek formula , and this ai n't it.On that note
 You can dance , groove , bob your head and be touched emotionally all in one sitting . This CD simply rocks !
 Moby is so original . There is no artist like him.Get Play just for Natural Blues alone.You will love it .
 This album is probably one of the most influentual in pop music . I first heard Moby in 94 when he was just one of many decent dj 's . His hit `` Feeling so real '' was one great dance song that was frequently played for a while , but then i did n't hear him much until 97 and 2 years later this album came out and it has become some kind of modern classic . Moby had found himself , it was not just techno , it was something else . A artistic album where the new york dj Moby had mixed alot of diffrent genre 's into one , blues , soul , rock some pop . It 's a album with 18 songs and many of them are very diffrent from each other . `` Natural blues '' and `` Why does my heart feel so bad '' were slow songs with perfectly matches beats and sad vocals . Same thing with the even slower `` Porcelain '' . The album gave Moby charisma and a great flavor of diffrent genre 's , many other dj 's did the same thing later on . There were faster songs too like `` Bodyrock '' `` Honey '' and `` Find my baby '' soul inspired `` If things were perfect '' and the rock inspired `` Southside '' . Perhaps too many songs , on the first half you 'll find all hits and one the second album material . They are not fillers though . Remember that Moby released a huge amount of songs from this album . Cretit to Moby for a diffrent a beautiful album were most songs are pleasant and beautiful . It launched dance music a lot bigger audience then before and he 's still doing well .
 Moby 's PLAY is one of the CDs which an artist makes exactly one time . It is an album which transcends musical boundries and genres , combining jazz , classical , blues , R&B , electronic and ambient into a swirling eddy of creative genius . This is one of the all-around strongest musical efforts I have experienced
 Just ask anyone across the pond . In 1999-2002 , DJ 's from all over were still making remixes from cuts on this album . I was n't the biggest Moby fan but admit that this certainly pushed him up a peg in my book . No need for an introduction of him or his label - most know who he is!Simply put , this is an essential cd for anyone that 's into collecting work from DJ 's or interested in the originals behind the many great remixes that spawned from this album . From trance facelifts to `` Natural Blues '' on the Euphoria series to the chillout ambience of `` My Weakness '' ... also on the Euphoria chill series , it 's just a sound album . Probably the most mainstream of the cuts here is `` South Side '' , a good tune that crept into main-stream with Gwen Stefani . And if you remember when the Lincoln LS debuted a few years ago -LRB- well , maybe it was several ! -RRB- , there was a big deal about `` Porcelain '' being used in the innovative commercial and advertising . Another notable track that made loads and loads of playlists was `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad '' . The verdict ? I would certainly recommend it . But if you 're a fan of what you 've heard on the radio - i.e. , the Gwen Stefani track then you would understandably be disappointed with this . Also , not all of the tracks here grabbed me . I think 2002 was the year that `` 18 '' came out - I do n't think it 's as strong as this one but it is certainly similar . And since then he has released an album titled `` Baby Monkey '' under the monker `` Voodoo Child '' . It 's an electronic sound and much different than this . But if you 're a die-hard Moby fan , you 'll want it and 18 . And certainly check out his live shows if you can !
 I assume everyone has this by now , but if not , it 's a pretty amazing album . I think `` Moby '' is pretty much thought of as techno , but there 's so much more on here . Some of this is techno , but it 's also gospel , pop , new age , blues , ambient , etc. . The hits like `` Southside '' and `` Bodyrock '' are definitely the most upbeat tracks , others are beautiful and hypnotic , and could put you to sleep . `` Porcelain '' and `` Natural Blues '' were also singles off this , and I like the songs `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad '' and `` If Things Were Perfect '' just as much . The last track `` My Weakness '' is pretty moving too . Any one with an open mind , or an interest in the genre should dig this . His other albums are good as well , but I suspect this is his best .
 Your ears will thank you for buying this album . You can really chill out to it with all the musical styles covered - pop , techno , rock but where it really shines is the bluesy gospel/electronic fusion with the awesome tracks Natural Blues & Run On , yes I love the blues but you do n't have to be biased towards any particular type of music to enjoy this album as it cleverly mixes most genres . Easily 5 stars as I ca n't think of any weak points on this .
 Moby is definitely one of the greats of our time . `` Play '' is pure digital work of art . It 's one of the greatest albums of all time ! Go Moby !!
 I bought Moby 's Play with only hearing South Side on the radio a few times . Little did I know that after listening to the entire album that South Side would be one of my least favorite tracks on the album . Play is the one cd I own that I can listen to over and over without getting track skip happy . My favorite tracks on the album are
 Moby 's venture into American roots music and the work of Alan Lomax has produced a definitive album . The concept was unique when Moby first pushed it forth , and it was a good concept to push . The roots music hooks that Moby works into many of the songs on the album , combined with Moby 's unique take on techo and trance make this album the best place to start for all new Moby fans .
 First of all , those who rank this album anything less than a five have n't a clue . This album teases the senses of all music genres . Full of beat , soul , and sounds , Moby has proven himself a musical genius . I can not recall a time when so many tracks off one album -LRB- all of them if i am not mistaken -RRB- have been used for commercials and/or sountracks . Eclectic , for sure ... ingenious , without a doubt . You will find yourself listening to this album , track after track after track . Without a doubt , his strongest album , and easily one of the overall best albums in the last five years .
 This CD is absolutely INCREDIBLE !!! This is the greatest Moby disc ever ! From incredible tracks that make me think about everything , such as `` Guitar Flute and String '' , `` Natural Blues '' and `` Porcelain '' -LRB- which is my favorite MobySong ever -RRB- , to fun jumpy trackslike , `` Honey '' , `` Bodyrock '' , `` Machete '' , and `` Find My Baby '' . Not to mention the classic track `` South Side '' featuring Gwen Stefani . If you like Moby , buy this CD ! If you like quality music , buy this CD ! If you appreciate life , BUY THIS CD !!!
 I heard a few of Moby 's pieces as comercial `` jingles '' and was hesitant about buying one of his CDs.My mistake . Mobey 's work is as orchistrated as Aron Copeland . Absoluteley beautiful.Get this CD .
 Moby is great ! If you buy this cd , I highly reccommend number 1 , number 5 , and number 7 . My mom and dad like Moby just as well as I do , and I like it a lot !
 Play is a great album . I had never heard of Moby until about five months ago , when I saw him perform on the PBS show , ' 54 ' , and , ever since then , I have been hooked . I got ` Play ' and loved it . I think this album is very well-crafted , with each song flowing into the next . After listening to this album , I found Everything Is Wrong , and then I Like To Score , and , most recently , Ambient , and I 've loved every one of them . One thing I have learned about Moby is that he can not be put into one category of music . He mixes styles together , and does n't confine himself to just techno or just rock . Personnaly , I think that there 's at least one Moby song -LRB- or remix -RRB- that people who think they do n't like Moby will love.I 've read some of the not so favorable reviews of ` Play ' here , and the negativity of some of these people is just appalling . Geez , let people make their own judgments . I 'm not telling anyone to go out and buy ` Play ' right now . I 'm just saying what I like about Moby.Give it a try , listen to some songs from ` Play ' , and , if you like them , go buy the album or whatever other recording may intrigue you . Do n't let other people 's opinions of something you have n't experienced decide whether or not you should experience it .
 I play this CD every day at work . It helps me to stay relaxed and calm while the phone is ringing off the hook and ten people are asking me to do something at the same time . Very spiritual .
 The first time I listened to Play , I admit I was a little bored . The songs seemed a bit repetitive , although I thought the juxtaposition of old blues and gospel samples with techno breaks was musically interesting and pleasing to my ear . The second time I heard it , however , it started to grow on me in a major way . I think part of my problem was that Play is not the kind of album I can just sit there and listen to - I need to be doing something else at the same time . When it sinks into the background , I find it gets me moving and feeling uplifted . It is a very spiritual record , and Moby is a spiritual guy , which is what makes it work , I think . If you can give this album the benefit of the doubt , you may find it to be your new favorite .
 Simply put this is the best album I have heard in the last year , maybe more . Has something for everybody and every song is worth listening to . One of my top picks out of my whole collection .
 For those of you who have followed Moby , ROCK ON ! For those of you who have just found out about him on a commercial , movie , or MTV ... WELCOME to the FABULOUS world of MOBY ! This man is outstanding ! This CD really does n't sound like his others ... it has a lot of different styles that Moby can just throw at you when you 're not looking ... The Sky Is Broken touches me deep down ... his voice ... the words ... PURE POETRY ! If you 're looking to give Moby a try , I recommend this CD !
 Sadly neglected at the Grammy 's , this collection of gospel-techno-ambient-soul food was the best CD of 1999 . Each track is different , but all favor the unique , almost subliminal beat and subtle sampling that is Moby 's trademark . Ideal for creating Spinning -LRB- R -RRB- mixes , or play the first 7 tracks straight through . This album is the benchmark from which all future `` DJ/Dance '' releases will be judged . favorite cuts `` Southside '' and `` Natural Blues ''
 I was browsing the record store , and the clerks had this one playing . I had intentions of buying a CD other than this one , but after listening to it in the store I had to have it . I had never heard of Moby , and that is something I have never done before , but I am glad I did . This is definitely one of the best CDs out there , you can listen to the entire thing all the way through .
 This album is incredible
 For a year none of my cd 's could beat collective soul , but then , I bought this , and amazingsly , its right up there with the best of em . If you like techno , dance , house , or just music in general , this is a must-have .
 This is some of the best , most accessible -LRB- and not in a bad way -RRB- techno music I 've ever heard . My sister hates techno passionately , and she loves this CD . There is not one song here that I do n't like , but the best ones are `` Porcelain '' , `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad ? '' -LRB- my favorite -- one of the most beautiful songs I 've heard in awhile -RRB- , `` Rushing '' , `` Natural Blues '' , and `` Everloving '' . Also , Moby 's essays in the jacket -- on everything from the treatment of prisoners to fundamentalist Christians -- are very well-written and interesting .
 I found that I purchased `` Play '' for Moby 's cut `` Porcelain '' . The more I listened to this CD , the more I found alternative favorites . This is my first Moby purchase , and I 'm thrilled I stumbled on it . -LRB- Diehard Moby fans excuse me - I 'm just learning -RRB- I find many tracks to be calming and peaceful -LRB- ie
 I had never heard of Moby before when I was `` forced '' to listen to it in a record store . I bought it right away , and I think I still have n't fully discovered all its beauty . Most of it is just very nice and wonderful music . If you only know the singles you might be somewhat confused by the plethora of styles on the album , though .
 First of all , i am very excited by the way that music is unfolding into the 21 century . After listening to Play , i have decided that we are heading towards a new revolution within the art of music . I have been searching the question of ` who will take us there ' and i have come up with the answer that lies in the movement . Moby will take us there along with friends like radoihead and Nigel Godrich . But this is supposed to be a review for `` Play , '' right . well folks , all i can tell you is that if you want to know what revolution sounds like , insert `` Play '' into your cd player , cassette tape deck , turntable , or what have you and be on the alert for your smoke and sqirmish and musical disclosure.michael
 I BOUGHT THIS AFTER HEARING SOME BUZZ ABOUT IN VARIOUS MUSIC MAGS.I WAS VERY DUBIOUS AS I HAVE A LOT OF CDS AND AM TIRED OF SPENDING MY BUCKS ON HYPE WITH NO FULFILLMENT . MOBY IS EXCELLENT , MY FAVORITE CUT SO FAR IS `` FIND MY BABY '' IT 'S SOOOOOO COOL . `` PORCELAIN '' AND `` WHY DOES MY HEART FEEL SO BAD '' ARE ALSO GOOD TRACKS . I LOVE THE ATMOSPHERIC FEEL OF `` PORCELAIN '' IT REMINDS OF YES AND ELO FROM MY YOUTH . IF YOU ACTUALLY LIKE MUSIC WITH SOUL BUY IT NOW ! P.S. SORRY ABOUT THE SPELLING .
 I could n't agree more with the previous reviews , and the media -- this is without a doubt a 1999 top 10 pick . It 's absolutely Moby 's finest , in my opinion . But with success and popularity , comes the dreaded overdose over the radio waves . Not that I really mind -- I rarely listen to the radio anymore since Moby , FatBoy Slim , and The Crystal Method happened -- and it 's a great way to turn others on to this great CD .
 This is one of my favorite records now . This is a new direction for techno music . It is essentially Moby 's take on the blues . It samples old field recordings and jazz records and makes them into songs that only amplify the feelings expressed in the original samples . By just using one or two lines throughout a whole song , it still makes an amazing emotional impact . this is a landmark album
 What can I say about this album ? I could say that it is as good as any other Moby-album which would mean that it is perfect , brilliant , marvellous , beautiful , sad , happy - in short words
 What a long slow burner this album has been.It 's hard to believe that it is practically two years old.One of the first places it first came to prominence was in Ireland and in Germany.Then many of the tracks were used on t.v. adverts in the U.K. and it has been a steady climber in North America for a long time.Many people describe this as purely a dance album , but I think the sound is far to varied to closet it into one category.The first thing that struck me about the c.d. the first time I heard it was the way Moby used the sound of old spiritual music and combined it with drum machines , synths and plenty of bass to give it a really dancey feel.Many of the songs though like this are just a bit too slow to be looked upon as dancefloor faves.The first two songs and track 8 the blues song Natural Blues have this groundbreaking sound to them.Then of course there are the ambient tracks like Porcelain-which is a really beautiful song apart from the weedy singing.This song takes you to a dreamy paradise and it was no surprise they used it on the soundtrack to the movie The Beach.Track 6 Rushing is also quite ambient but in an even slower more mellow sort of way.Track 13 does ambient but in a style you would associate with The Chemical 's - especially the excellent bass riff that dominates this song.Track 4 `` Why Does My Heart ... '' Was a huge hit in Germany before this c.d. was huge worldwide and it 's easy to see why.The sound is more poppy then most of the tracks.It 's sort of a halfway house between the tracks which are totally influenced by those spiritual sounds and a commercial dance , soul pop song.It 's the most commercial track on a pretty commercial c.d. `` Bodyrock '' has the quickest tempo-a real dance song , with a rock edge guitar riff and non-stop in your face rap.This is a long c.d.-63 mins and it has 18 tracks.Some of the more interesting tracks are towards the end-but these tracks seem to have been more or less ignored.Track 14-Everloving is a beautiful song-almost folky acoustic guitar , haunting piano and ambient synth effects.Which build into a glorious almost technicolour climax.Track 15 has total minimalist ambience-strong drum machine beating out an even , constant and simple rhythmic pattern ; sweeping synth chords and then the dark strong single piano notes add to 5 minutes of dreamy pleasure.Things get even slower on the next track called `` Guitar flute & string '' - the sound is fully explained by the song title.All in all this c.d. is an essential purchase.It 's also a nice introduction to a semi-dance sound for those only getting into that musical genre.The c.d. has been a bit over-exposed over here , yet there are enough tracks of excellent quality towards the end of the c.d. that remain fairly untouched by those commercial powers.The songs at the start still sound great though , especially up at a healthy volume and when you have n't heard them in a long time.next one should be interesting !
 With 10 years in the music wilderness pumping out quality tunes like Go , Moby may have been forgiven for giving up music and living off what little royalties he had gained . Luckily for us he did n't and instead decided to show us how a great album should sound.The first half of Play is much stronger than the second half but this is n't a bad thing . With memorable songs like Find My Baby , Honey and South Side at the start you are instantly entrapped in Moby 's genius like world and this is further confirmed by the hughe hits Porcelain and Natural Blues as well as the utter classic Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad.With a start like this at first the rest is a little disappointing at first but the more you listen the more you appreciate it and understand the more downbeat melancholic music which lets you unwind after a strenuous start and you grasp its true quality.Every song here has its own distinct identity yet the all combine together to produce an amazing album and undoubtably one of the classic albums of the late 90 's and one which is a must .
 I 'm not a techno fan . As a matter of fact I dislike most of that stuff . I know this is n't true ultra-orthodox techno , but it 's techno enough . This CD is fantastic.For years I 've heard about Moby 's genius -LRB- even from people that do n't like this kind of music -RRB- , but was always a little hesitant of buying one of his records for the simple fact that I 'm not too keen on this genre.Well , as one of the naysayers , I must humble myself and proclaim brilliance on the part of Moby ! My brother loaned this to me a while a go and it has n't left my player since . As a matter of fact when he wanted it back , I went out that very evening and purchased it for myself . `` Run On '' is my favorite track on the album . Its got that great mixture of groove and gospel . Its amazing how he seamlessly weaves styles so disparate as gospel and techno . `` Porcelain '' is a splendid track as well . The floaty , ethereal , whispy drift is addictive . `` South Side '' has a loose vibe and makes for some good driving music.Some moments are less glimmering than others -LRB- hence the 4 stars instead of 5 . -RRB- It is , however , one of the best popular albums to be released in years -LRB- when I say `` popular '' I 'm referring to non-folk and non-classical forms . -RRB-
 I collect soundtracks -LRB- 350 + cds -RRB- and I 'm big on music other than mainstream . Moby seems to hit my musical taste on the head , then work his way stealthily through my mind . `` Porcelain , '' -LRB- from `` The Beach '' soundtrack -- another great CD -RRB- `` Why does my heart ... ? '' `` Rushing , '' and `` My Weakness '' are all incredibly good . I hope to see more of Moby as I just recently discovered his talent . He has many songs on other soundtracks like `` Heat , '' `` The Saint '' and many , many more . He can be uniquely appreciated by all .
 I 'm not a huge techno fan , and i bought this cd on a whim . After my second listen to this amazing cd , i was totally hooked . It did not leave my cd player for the next several weeks , and i ca n't recommend it enough to anybody who like to listen to beautiful music . Run on , Natural Blues , Porcelain , and Honey all convey such raw emotion , it can bring tears to your eyes , while the intensity of bodyrock brings this album to a fevered pitch . Then the last several tracks sooth and calm , leaving the listener in a zen like state . Put this cd in your stereo and listen straight through . I use it to phsyche myself up , and clam myself down . It is awesome . Buy it ! This cd has totally changed my view on techno .
 I bought this CD what seems to be a million years ago . If it was an LP , I would have worn the grooves smooth . It is omnipresent , like a juggernaut crushing everything in its path . I ca n't get away from the songs here - they are in commercials on TV , movie previews , on the radio , and in my dreams . Who would think mixing down home gospel and elecronica would go together as well as chocolate and peanut butter . I know some purists ca n't stand this album and some mainstreamers do n't get it . Fine . For something to be worthy it does n't have to be universally loved , just talked about . I think this album will have legs , and people will be listening carefully for years to come .
 Moby is usually referred to as a wizard or iconoclast of techno , but I am afraid you wo n't find any cutting-edge techno here . Rather than indulging in brand-new sounds , Moby has an absolute ear for the sounds of yore , not unlike Fatboy Slim and Beck . Fatboy Slim mixed reggae and fifties ' pop ; Beck is at home in the seventies . In this CD Moby goes for the gospell/blues afroamerican tradition , and mixes it with his dance roots . Blues and trance share one thing
 I do n't know what Moby has done -- perhaps `` Play '' has subliminal messages that are telling me to do it -- but I can not stop listening to this CD . I bought it about two weeks ago , and although other CD 's have come and gone as the weeks have passed , `` Play '' has remained stationary the whole time . However , it has not remained dormant . This CD is just a simple joy to listen to -- I do n't ever skip a track -LRB- well , I occasionally bypass If Things Were Perfect and The Sky Is Broken , but 16 out of 18 hits ai n't bad ! -RRB- . Now , I know other reviewers have been spouting about Moby 's heart-felt compositions and clear spiritual writing , and I agree with them to a degree . His music is spiritual , and `` My Weakness '' rips my heart out every time I listen to the CD -LRB- it also helps that a certain `` X-Files '' episode adds to the emotional impact -RRB- . The only thing that I know for certain about Moby 's music is that I ca n't get it out of my head . I find myself singing it to myself at work , in class , or even while playing Ultimate Frisbee . It 's infectious ! And it 's wonderful -- simply put . Add to the fact that this is coming from a person who has roughly less than 30 `` mainstream '' CD 's -LRB- I 'm kind of a movie soundtrack buff and I do n't usually buy a CD unless I know it 's worth the money -- and this one definitely is -RRB- . I feel that this is one of the best CD 's that I own -- even better than most of the soundtracks I own ! I listen to it while studying , reading , relaxing ; I have it on while partying ; I play it while just hangin out in my room ; I have it on all the time ! Now , I 'm not sure if this is persuasive enough to make you buy this CD -LRB- I 'm only a new member to jump on the Moby-bandwagon and I 'm not one to usually listen to these reviews -- no offense -RRB- , but you SHOULD listen to these reviews -- at least the good ones -- because this CD is worth every penny . If I knew what I know now about the CD when I bought it , I 'd be willing to pay at least twice , even three times what it 's selling for ! It 's that good -- trust me . But I 'm babbling . Just do yourself a favor and buy this CD . You wo n't regret it , honestly .
 I have a new favorite . `` Play '' has become the soundtrack to my life , and from the sounds coming through my ceiling it has for my neighbors as well . No music has felt so natural to me in a long time . I felt like I had heard the songs before , even though I had n't . If you only buy one album this year , let this be it . I do n't know how anybody could n't find something that they like on this .
 This CD is full of talent , beauty and soul . I bought the CD once I 'd heard it was out . And oh boy , I 'm so happy for that . I think everyone can find his favorites here . Songs like `` Why Does My Heart Feel so Bad ? '' , `` My Weakness '' , `` Natural Blues '' and `` Everloving '' make me cry . No , not almost , but in real tears . They are so touching . BTW , have you seen the video clip for `` Why Does ... '' song ? Wow ! So simple and yet so beautiful . Now , if you want some temper and humor , you would love `` Honey '' , `` Run On '' , `` Find My Baby '' and there are so much more . Please , even if you do n't know the artist , never heard of him . Try ! At least give it a try . Enjoy !
 Play by Moby is one of the best C.D. 's I have ever listened too . It grabs your heart and soul and put in a twist of New-Age Pop music , turning this C.D into a enjoyable C.D. My mother along with my sister -LRB- 26 yrs old -RRB- and my young Niece -LRB- 5yrs old -RRB- loves this C.D. also . I 'm am not only speaking for myself but for my family when I say this is the best C.D yet I have heard .
 It just sounds like Moby . If you do n't know what that sounds like , then buy this album . Anybody is bound to find at least a few tracks that they like . I have to admit though , I do not like the first track ... It actually annoys me . But , taking that into consideration combined with the fact that I 'm still giving it 5 stars , you can safely conclude that it 's an album worth adding to your collection .
 Moby 's Play is truly an essential album . The tracks vary from upbeat , techno and dance beats , to slow , ambient and relaxing melodies . You 'll recognize some of the tunes from car commercials , television and films , such as The X-Files . The strong combination and variety of these songs balances out the theme of this album . Moby has combined very definitive elements and rhythms into his music , that can capture almost anyone 's attention . Good for dances , parties , or relaxing at home with a good novel .
 I 've never been a Moby fan , and I was really reluctant to buy this album . I had bought Everything Is Wrong , mostly because I liked the album title , and even though it was pretty great in some ways , the schizophrenia of it put me off quite a bit . So I was pretty surprized at how thoroughly coherent Play is , especially when it contains songs as seemingly incompatable as Bodyrock -LRB- which sounds very Fatboy-Slim influenced -RRB- and Porcelin , the complete opposite . But it all works , somehow , combining sampled Gospel vocals and electronica to create a whole new musical genre.Doesn ' t Moby come up with some great song titles ? Check 'em out . Another plus is how even though he 's a very devout Christian and vegan , he does n't feel the need to preach about it in his music . Instead , he puts essays of his into the liner notes , and even though I do n't agree with his politics , he makes some very valid points in his essays that I definately respect . `` Find My Baby '' is probably my favorite song on here , although they 're all good . Some are really techno-y , but still original enough to escape the facelessness that plagues a lot of electronic music . I think for this album Moby was really influenced by the Fatboy Slim/Chemical Brothers strategy of gradually building up songs by slowly piling on more and more instruments . He took what they had already done , added some gospel samples , and took it to the max . Also , unlike the Chemical Brothers for example , Moby has clearly spent a lot of time analyzing his song structures and making sure they never go on so long that they turn into a bunch of hammering , repetitive noise . A lot of these songs start out very basic , maybe just a lone vocal or keyboard part , but once enough relatively simple instrument parts start piling up upon each other , the songs just gain this sense of epicness . Great stuff .
 I think `` Play '' is a terrific album , really ... but I 'm not really writing my review for that reason . The guy a few reviews below said this is the kind of album you get when you sign to a big label . Unfortunately , this is Moby 's first album after getting DROPPED from a major label , in this case Elektra . They did n't think he could sell album anymore . V2 picked him up , and a goldmine in the process.Just wanted to clear up a misconception about a great album .
 Much of modern music is based off loops . Like most contemporary electronic artists Moby too uses loops . In all of his tracks you can notice the theme lopping over and over and over . Although the looping is boring by definition , Moby makes his loops interesting by varying rhythmical and synth patterns and ultimately capturing listener 's attention by ever-changing texture of his synthetic tracks . Albeit , Moby 's music is lacking something in the melody . Listening to Moby 's `` Play '' album I a little bit miss the motion and melody development seen in classical compositions , or in more recent tracks by William Orbit or UltraMax Music . But still , the `` Play '' is unique in the way loops are re-processed and presented to the listener , especially considering that nobody 's done it like this before . Overall - very interesting and album with some `` fresh '' sound and approach to composion .
 I do n't know where I 've been but I missed Moby along the way . I caught him , Jill Scott and Blue Man Group on an award show last year and really enjoyed it so picked up this CD . I can understand why so many advertisers buy up the rights to use even snips of his material . Though I usually find tech music rather cold , I feel a spirit and warmth behind the beat . I also recognized a few melodies from commercials . Enjoyable to listen to when driving ... almost mandatory to be played loud so you can feel it and hear the texture of the music .
 If I would have to name top 10 songs list , about 5 of them would be in this CD . I like techno-like music which happens to be almost all the time very annoying when listened too much . Moby is something else because of his original style putting peaceful samples in tracks . Like Porcelain is n't actually quite usual for any genre of music . Overall
 WOW ! what can I say ??? this c.d. blew me a way . this is the first moby c.d. that i bought . only because of the song with gewn -LRB- who i love -RRB- ! to my surprise , i LOVE EVERY SINGLE SONG ! this man is talnted ! he did everything himself ! if you do n't own this yet , you are really missing out
 Get up and dance ! Best music to dance to or listen to when sitting in front of your computer ... or better yet , driving in your car . Very cool . Moby is a genius .
 Moby sure knows how to play a fine melody . A lot of songs on ` Play ' sound great and do have immediate appeal . It is very nice to listen to ` Play ' . Highlights are
 On Moby 's '99 album `` Play '' , Moby uses soul and folk music to give his rhythm a little personality . The pianos and keyboards have a classical feel where the rhythm brings in a techno style and the vocals make you want to celebrate . I believe Play is the best album of ' 99 . The album covers many levels and must be heard completely to uncover th whole package . You do n't even have to like dance to enjoy this record . Top cuts include `` Honey '' , `` Machete '' , and `` Everloving '' . Play is a definant classic .
 I am not generally a techno fan . The last two Chemical Brothers ' albums had some good points , but ultimately felt redundant and ... done . This is the exception I have been waiting for . This album is by turns masterful , haunting , elegant , and fun . Putting the old blues songs to a techno beat is an ingenious idea , and Moby pulls it off effectively . I would not hesitate to call this the best album of the past year . It is the kind of album that will only grow better with age . High points include Southside , Natural Blues , Find My Baby , Porcelein , and a handful of others . But the fact that I center on those does not mean that they were the only good songs . Something for everyone is here , because it is such a deeply atmospheric record . For me , it is right up there with OK Computer -LRB- Radiohead -RRB- , To Bring You My Love -LRB- PJ Harvey -RRB- , and Under the Pink -LRB- Tori Amos -RRB- . If you have been looking for a great record that is sophisticated and `` pretty , '' this is it . These songs will stick in your head for a long time as anthems to the world around us , which is what I think Moby was trying to pull off.Believe me , he succeeded .
 The first two tracks are a bit repetitious , but hang in there . After that , it 's sublime . Especially great are `` Porcelain '' and `` Run On '' .
 Well , I am so pleased that I bought this album . It is wonderful . . full of great beats , infectious voices , and melodies that play in your head all day . There is also an element of emotional struggle and sadness in there which gives the whole project a human touch that is so lacking in a lot of these types of albums.His mixing is clever , and the twisting of the samples through the grooves had me dancing -LRB- and I NEVER dance . -RRB- Please have a listen , Im sure you will love it .
 I love this song ! It is SO worth buying the whole CD just for the song `` My Weakness '' . I first heard it on the X-files -LRB- you got ta love this show . -RRB- and , well , all you can say is WOW ! Moby is so talented ! WOW ! Buy it now if you 're in for some great music . -LRB- Especially this song ! -RRB-
 When I first heard Natural Blues on the radio I thought to myself , `` Now hear is something that will keep me from doing 100 in the 55 zone on my daily 45 mile commute to school . '' I was a bit worried about ordering the CD because I already have plenty of house , techno and trance music , but nothing with a slow steady rythm . Thankfully most of this album is exactly that . I really fo enjoy it on those long lonesome drives . I would recommend something else if you do want to dance though .
 This is undoubtedly Moby 's most electic and ambitious effort to date . This album is a glorious composition of his many diverse musical inspirations , spanning many generations and genres . Once crowned as the king of the bourgening techno scene in the early 90 's , Moby has branched out and showcased his sprawling talent . Songs like `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad ? '' pulls otherwise unrelated elements such as heart-felt gospel and blues and transcendent , ambient synths into seamless , glowing works . His devotion to the beat and old-school hip-hop is in tact , as evidenced by the nostalgic boom-box track `` Bodyrock '' . This wicked mix is beautifully enhanced with sweeping synth hooks without compromising the `` get up and dance , y' all '' feel of the groove . Throughout the album , various instrumental samples including folksy guitar work and delicate piano play are complemented by an array of vocal styles from spiritual Eastern to melodic Western . After thorough exploration of these 18-tracks , one can glimpse the many other hidden muses which inspired Moby to produce such a masterful effort that pushes beyond conventional pop sensibilities . Choosing a favorite song for this album is rather difficult and then ultimately becomes random as one track alone can not convey the depth of this album . Regardless , for those of you that are so inclined , you will discover that for yourself ...
 I 'll never stop thanking a friend of mine who almost chained me to the chair and forced me to listen to this astonishing cd . imMOBYlized ! I just could n't believe to my ears
 Intense was the first word that came to my mind!Alot of the songs are very peacful and relaxing!Anyone who loves dance music-this is a must buy!There are also some essays written by Moby that are unrelated to the music that I found very interesting!He made some very good points.He is very intelligent which makes me more respectful of his music !
 This is my first Moby CD and , man , does this guy ROCK ! I absolutely love the way he has incorporated old Spiritual music into his techno-sound . This CD was on in the car for the entire drive to D.C. three weeks ago . You must have an excellent sound system to fully appreciate this music . You 'll be hooked for life .
 In an era dominated by Grunge and Hip-hop , Moby managed to create an album which will arguably be placed on the best list of the 90 's . He introduced the Blues to Electronica and made it commercially trendy .
 I admit , I often get opinionated over some music after hearing about the artists themselves , but in Moby 's case
 ... about Moby that stretches beyond remarking on his understated musical genius , wry humour and exquisite creativity.This album was a classic from it 's first pressing and will live on and on tirelessly . Thank the lord for intelligent , creative souls like Moby , the weightiness of his album sales speaks volumes about how starved of this kind of musical genre people are today . LONG LIVE MOBY !
 If there is one totally perfect album then this would be `` Play '' . amazing songs , lots of emotions , music perfect for everything and everyone.That 's all.if you have n't heard , buy it immediately
 Moby is absolutely amazing . The way he can do all this work all by himself is stunning . This album takes the Techno rule book and tosses it out the window .
 It really is great music , very classic , even if commercials have gnawed away at what was once new became stale and ... distant . It 's not Moby 's fault , it just undermined what he had done on the album -LRB- for me -RRB- . The tracks are all nicely varied and yet , it feels like a complete album in that they all seem to share some quality . If Moby had included some of his drawings , this could 've been even better ! Visit Moby.com which won a prize for best Webpage -LRB- it deserved it -RRB- . I do n't think ' 18 ' really compares to this .
 Ok , ok , I know the new album is out but I 'm still addicted to Play cause it 's just that good ! The CD mixes the elements of electronic but also seems to shy away from being just straight bass every song . `` Honey '' opens the CD as a strong and good track followed by `` Find My Baby '' and the ever popular `` Porcelain '' made popular by the trailer for The Beach . `` Porcelain '' also remains a key song on the album because it just intoxicates you and wisks you away . `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad '' is another landmark track with passion in the lyrics shown in the increase of the music intensity . `` Southside '' is an awesome track and with Gwen Stefani on the later issues , it just makes the song even stronger though it 's not the best track on the CD . `` Rushing '' , also made popular on the trailer for Unfaithful , is probably one of my favorite tracks because it just rushes over you and definately was appropriate for Unfaithful for more than one reason that Amazon prohibits me from saying in a review since you all know . `` Bodyrock '' and `` Natural Blues '' are good tracks on the album but seem mediocre in comparision to the first set of tracks . `` Machete '' picks up a techno/speed metal sound almost at some parts but it 's amazing and `` 7 '' is just so strange but grabs your attention definately . Oooh , `` Run On '' , interesting track that seems almost simplistic but almost reminds me of something from the 50s happy times but it 's twisted more if that makes sense . `` Down Slow '' is a great song to relax to and one of my favs as well and is proceeded by the track `` If Things Were Perfect '' , a track that disappointed me on the album . `` Everloving '' adds in the acoustic elements while `` Inside '' makes you feel like you are flying or just at peace ... amazing masterpiece song . `` Guitar , Flute , and String '' sounds sad but good at the same time and `` Sky Is Broken '' almost seems out of place at the end of the album surrounded by the songs it is . `` My Weakness '' ends the CD and it 's just beautiful ... children playing in the background at the beginning , choirs singing , and then a piano lightly enters in but creates rhythm , sadness , everything that might come from a memory arising . Play was a breakthrough album when it came out and even with his new release , this album still remains the best of Moby and probably the best of all electronica CDs -LRB- even though this CD really is in a class of its own -RRB- .
 PLAY is probably Moby 's greatest critical success . It is so engenius at some points , that it makes you wonder if he 's a musical god . Great musicianship , outstanding samples that could make any other DJ drool with envy , and big beats . Of course , the entire CD is n't just one Natural Blues over and over again ... Great slow , melancholic tracks like ` The Sky Is Broken ' also display Moby 's incredible talent . Great album , that really did deserve some Grammy awards.Best Tracks
 I bought this CD in the Summer of 1999 because I was a fan of Moby 's previous works . I loved his self-titled album and Everything Is Wrong , and was expecting more of the same . I was taken aback . Moby seems to have gone from underground techno artist , with us since the beginning , to top artist in the genre , or maybe up there with Fatboy Slim.Fast-forward to Summer 2001
 this cd is good for every type of mood you may be in . all of its music verys and each is captivating in its own way . don not be discouraged by the over-exposure of the song `` porcelin . '' remember that is a great song too and in time when the radio stations stop playing it youll like it again . if you like the recordings i think youll like the cd just as much . `` my weakness '' is a beautiful song . you might recognize it from one of the last episodes of the X-FILES . if you like bjork , massive attack , or beuocoup fish i thing youll like this one too .
 I have to tell you I have n't heard one single song by moby that I did not like . Everything that this man makes always sounds great ! THAT 'S WHY YOU DO N'T NEED MY REVIEW OR ANYONE ELSE 'S , YOU JUST GO OUT AND BUY THIS CD , BECAUSE WHATEVER HAS MOBY ON IT IS DEFINITELY A WINNER !
 And in the top ten of the 1990s . What 's truly brilliant about this album is that it crosses so many genres and yet is a coherent whole . I 've found that this album still feels new after numerous listenings . My personal favourite track is Everloving , followed by Porcelain and Machete . I prefer the ambient tracks to the more aggressive-sounding songs , but every track shows Moby 's great love of music and the genius he devotes to it as a result.This CD is a very welcome addition to my collection , and will be to yours as well .
 This is a great release from Moby . The songs are very moving and make you think .
 I have had this CD for about 6-8 months . I am still listening to it . It does not get old . It may NOT be musically ingenious ; it may NOT be advancing music ... but it does make me happy . Let me clarify that last statement with an example : I am upset ; I listen to this Cd ; I am no longer upset ; Very few CDs have this effect on me -LRB- Grover Washington 's Winelight being the only one that surpasses it -RRB- . Not ALL the tunes on here are great . But about 2/3 of them are , IMHO ... and seeing that there are 18 songs , that means you get around 12 good songs . For me 12 good songs = 1 good CD .
 I have never crossed an album that has totally emersed me in to the music . Some how Moby has done this and this album is just short of a masterpiece !!! WOW ! - Chris Meyer - HiChrisM@aol.com
 I like this album especially `` Porcelain '' and `` Run On '' I have the new one too , but I have to say he 's my favorite dance/rock artist out today `` Play '' is a good experience .
 If you like to relax . If you like to dance . If you like to imagine . If you like to giggle . Then this CD is for you . It 's technical with simple values . PLAY is one of my favorite CD 's . The only thing better than this CD is seeing Moby live . : - -RRB-
 Nothing like anything Moby has done before , it is a great album still , I highly recommend it .
 Moby outdid himself with this one ! He shines ! This album has the most eclectic assortment of music I have heard from one artist in a long time ! This also shows how versitle Moby can be ! This is a must have ! Rock On !
 This is a great dance album from ` Moby ' . `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad ? '' , `` Run On '' and `` Body Rock '' are really cool dance songs . When you listen to this top-selling album , you just want to dance ! ` Play ' is fantastic . 5 stars .
 Moby has always liked to surprise , what with his dance anthem ` go ' emerging from nowhere in 1990 to amaze us all . Since then his output has had moments of genius , some of the tunes on ' I like to score ' for instance , but many people were wondering if his demonstrably formidable skills were not being used to their full extent . Well , let me assure you ` GO ' is a return to the top for Moby , it has instantly catchy tracks , while revealing a surprising depth . I bought ` GO ' last August and I 'm still appreciating new aspects of the album , and if it 's possible , liking it even more . Moby has gone to earth for this album and made the sound an earthy , rustic one , which makes the album far more emotional than his other work . The gospel singers on ` why does my heart feel so bad ? ' for instance really tug at your heartstrings , and the blues samples of ` porcelain ' do the same . ` my weakness ' , the end track , has a lovely multitude of choirvoices which rise and fade , and end ` GO ' on a really wholesome note -LRB- sic -RRB- . What is apparent as well , is the seeming effortlessness of Moby 's tune and beat abilities . Many of the songs in this album are so well constructed , it 's a very welcome change from some of the other stuff coming out of the current Dance Scene . However , you do n't have to be into Dance , or Techno , or any other Genre to enjoy this album . I 'm not kidding when I say that ` GO ' appeals to such wide varieties of taste , it 's an essential album for the music conscious person .
 I have been a Moby fan since long before all the media hype that has surrounded Play . While he was still crafting crazy ambient masterpieces , heavy metal insanity , and hard house tracks , I was right there along with him . And not because i liked everything he did musically , but because he is such an admirable human being . He sticks to his beliefs and does n't push them on anyone else . He has always been willing to experiment musically , even when he caught a lot of slack from the press and fans alike -LRB- see Animal Rights -RRB- . But now , finally , everyone seems to agree on one thing ... Moby is truly someone to to watch . Play is yet another departure for Moby and his musical wanderings . Searching through old collections of blues spirituals and adding his distinct sounds and beats , Moby tried another musical formula and has at last succeeded in getting attention . Not that he planned it that way ... it just seems as though he hit the proverbial ` right note ' with this one . Play is a lengthy record and highlights his deep religious and political beliefs perhaps better than any previous record of his . The blues samples are carefully chosen , as though each song was his own completely . Moby 's reactionary attitude to the world around him seems to be fully realized on this release by the emphasizing the spiritual side of music . Play , though serious at many points , is also a very ` playful ' record as well , with tracks like Honey or Bodyrock reitterating his dancefloor past . This whole album speaks volumes by itself , but is better enjoyed with his previous albums close at hand . Moby has a lot to say , and it seems as though one record will not do this incredible talent 's mind full justice .
 This CD will touch your soul . Moby will inspire you , move you , sadden you , take you to utopia . Listen to sample # 4 , you 'll see what I mean .
 Like James Taylor , Joni Mitchell , Barry White ? I 'm nearly 50 and this is one of the best CD 's I 've heard in a long time . Wonderful driving music , ethereal melodies , sexy beat -- The Sky is Broken is tops . The CD photos of Moby mask the real gifts in this album . I think it will be timeless .
 i am not a christian but am stunned by this cd . i especially like PORCELAIN ! i am going to buy this cd for my 60 year old mother for mothers day , and for my born again sister ! the music is sublime !
 I got this CD for free after the buzz surrounding his Grammy nominations . Overall , the CD is good even though there are some filler tracks here . Still , you ca n't help it but wonder how Moby can turn a spiritual song from the 1920 's -LRB- or earlier -RRB- into a catchy , dancable tune . And the best part is he keeps all the songs simple and straightforward ! The best tracks on this CD are `` Honey '' , `` Find My Baby '' , `` Bodyrock '' , `` The Sky Is Broken '' , and `` My Weakness '' . By the way , `` Sky '' and `` Weakness '' were used in two episodes of `` The X-Files '' .
 Ok , here is the truth . Many will give Moby a hard time for making this album . Those people are usually techno purists , which is fine . Do not classify this album as techno , electronica , and so on . Just listen to it . It is good music . It has a feeling throughout , although the songs differ immensely . Do n't think you are getting 15 tracks of bodyrock . The cd is peaceful , moving , and exciting . It adapts to your mood . Put it on while reading , play it loud while driving , just give it a shot like the other millions who have bought it have . I will say that the hype surrounding it is a little much and may have caused it to become slightly overrated .
 I bought this album because much of the music has been used on the X-Files and I was not disappointed . I recommend listening to `` My weakness '' which is the music used when Mulder finally got to say goodbye to his sister . Once you hear the music and then see the scene , it will blow your mind . Another piece I recommend is `` The Sky is Broken '' which was used in the episode that Gillian Anderson wrote and directed .
 Do n't even bother reading his essays that accompany this CD . He 's obviously a narcissist . It 's the same old rhetoric you 've heard a million times before . But most of the music is unique , and great background for anything you need to do . It would sound awesome in a big echoey loft .
 I bought this the day it came out -LRB- almost 1 year now i beleive -RRB- i bought it because i was a fan of his , and this was a beautiful album.Moby is an electronic musician with rock influences . He is not known as a singer , and his singing on this album is hardly a high point or something to praise . He makes music and hew is very good at it -LRB- vocally as well . -RRB- Now he is very popular because of a movie soundtrack . WOW ! Now people everywhere will praise his singing . Hes been around for quite a few years , and this album is hardly new .
 I do n't care if Moby is a genius or not one . I do n't care if Moby is a techno artist or not one . I do n't care if Moby plays all his instruments or does not . I do n't care if Moby angers the blues purists out there or does not . I do n't care if Moby samples other artists or does not . I do n't care if Moby is a skinny white has been or if he is n't . I do n't care if Moby is `` in '' with the crowd or `` out '' . I do n't care if Moby writes essays or decides not to . But I DO care that he happened to release one of the most enjoyable recordings in the past 12 months . From one lover of Christ to another , Moby you kick it .
 I like what this guy 's doing . He really knows how to put inspiration on its feet !
 Before this cd , I hated techno . I am a x-files fan to the day i die and on two of the best episodes of the seventh season Moby 's music is playing `` The sky is broken '' and `` My weakness '' in the background and is the main theme of the drama . I love this cd , the beat of `` Machete '' is a noneforgeter , `` Honey '' , `` Find my baby '' , `` Why does my heart feel so bad ? '' , `` Natural blues '' and `` Run on '' have a jazzy blues to it . And `` If thing were perfect '' makes me want to dance in the moon light . All the songs on this cd are very powerful and you 'll catch yourself hymming them all day .
 Moby 's songs are verying relaxing for me . Some make you think -LRB- like porcelain and natural blues -RRB- , some make you want to get up and breakdance on the floor -LRB- bodyrock -RRB- . What I like is how the music `` progresses '' . Take bodyrock , for example . It starts out with an electric guitar , and then more instruments come in to play as the song progresses to its end . If you like thinking about things that happen in your life , buy this CD ,
 Yes ... I said it . This is better than any other Moby CD I have ever purchased . Not techno ... not dance ... not anything you have ever heard before . He mixes up blues , jazz , rap and all kinds of funky music with his Moby beats . EVERY SONG is GREAT !!! No joke . Mellow ... fast ... a well versed album . It will keep you dancing in your seat and wishing that there were an extra 15 tracks . A MUST BUY !
 I heard the huge hit , `` Southside '' and really enjoyed it . My wife and I picked up this CD and WOW , we were amazed and you will be too . Interesting , catchy , and fun
 Moby 's music is everywhere these days - TV , movies , videogames , raves - and it 's no surprise . Play is Moby 's best album
 Oh , I only wish I could give this CD 10 stars ! I personally feel that Moby is a genius . So many of the songs on the Play CD seem to `` speak '' to me deeply and express my innermost feelings . Each song is different from the one before it , and there is n't a single one I do n't like , which is very rare for me ! `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad ? '' is simply perfect - it 's the kind of song where , if you 've had a terrible day , you can flop down on the couch , turn off all the lights , and listen to it , and when it 's over you feel as though your own heart has been cleansed and refreshed . Fans of the show `` The X-Files '' might be interested to know that the last two tracks , `` The Sky is Broken '' and `` My Weakness , '' have both been used in X-Files episodes . `` The Sky . . '' was featured in the episode that Gillian Anderson wrote and directed , and `` My Weakness '' was used in the scene where Mulder was reunited with the spirit of his sister Samantha . Both these tracks are fantastic ! `` The Sky ... '' is incredibly soothing and relaxing . As for `` My Weakness , '' there are simply no words . I think it is the most incredible song I have ever heard - the emotions it is capable of stirring up are incredible . Every time I hear it , I like it more and more . You have to hear it to believe it . In my mind , the whole CD is worth it just for `` My Weakness ! '' But if you 're looking for an emotional , versatile CD that you 'll be listening to for years to come , this one is for you !
 When I moved up to university I was listening to the singles charts on the radio , and `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad ? '' charted at number 16 -LRB- in the UK -RRB- and I thought `` wow ! '' ! It really captured the mood I was in during that period.Few months later , I heard `` Natural Blues '' , followed by `` Porcelain '' . Whilst shopping , I thought I should take a chance and buy this album and it was a chance well taken.There is an interesting mixture of songs , -LRB- When I heard `` Honey '' for the first time I laughed , as I did n't know what to expect ! -RRB- , with the atmospheric , relaxing songs near the end of the 18 track album .
 This CD is awesome . All of the songs are great , especially Porclein .
 All the tracks are great , and all are unique . What a treat . Play !
 i did n't know MOBY and hear a song in a bar `` honey '' it was so fun , i was shop this cd and i listened and the others songs . it 's perfect ! i love MOBY
 Well , this sunday I was in my room , all along and like always seeing the X - Files and then in the end , I was soo moved when they play the song My Weakness , , , , , it make me feel so good and bad , , , But it is a great Cd I love it ...
 Simply excellent . It blew me away .
 a must for u if u love music .
 This is the sweetest song and will forever bring tears to my eyes . I first heard it in the X-files episode `` Closure '' . It captured the mood perfectly with it 's blended sound and I instantly fell in love with it . I 'm a obsessed X-files watcher and this song just made me even more obsessed !
 Just got the CD today and ca n't stop listening to it . The music is really soulful and yet at the same time has great techno beats . This CD makes for great upbeat ambiant background music while on the computer or cleaning your room . OR great to listen to , sing to or get up and dance to . The music on this CD is really easy to listen to , it does n't get on your nerves like some CDs do ! Buy it , you wo n't be disappointed!Also recommended

 Although I am not entirely familiar with his previous works -LRB- Everything 's Wrong , Animal Rights . etc. -RRB- , I 've noticed the critical success Moby has received . The other day I picked up Play , and I agree with the others that Moby is in fact a musical genious . It 's not so much the various genres of music he incorporates , but rather the way he weaves them together to create a certain texture that will simulataneously make you think and feel . Although I was not entirely seduced by the ambient pieces such as `` Inside '' and `` 7 '' , they are nice transitional pieces to keep the album flowing . Tracks like `` Natural Blues '' and `` Porcelain '' bring out Moby 's strength -- the ability to cleverly mix seemingly different genre 's to create a product that somehow attaches all the feelings each separate style evokes . And with a wave of his wand Moby can be surreal and real , transcend light years with nothing but ressurected bones , and give life to electronic and synthesized sounds . Regrettably , he sometimes opts to world music sounds , which are not bad , however , when sitting next to the other great songs on his album like `` Run-on '' sound all too ordinary . At his worst , Moby is head of his class , but at his best he 's a Genius . Play is a wonderful album in which Moby breaks down genres to show people that music should not and can not be categorized or stereotyped . Thank you Moby for giving mankind music that reconnects their heads to their hearts .
 I purchased this CD a couple of years ago on a whim , after having read the reviews and being bombarded with his name during some election periods . While I do n't agree with his political stance and methodologies , I do n't let that affect my likes/dislikes in music.I must say that this CD blew me away ; it was so different than many things I have heard before but yet the tunes were catchy and somewhat addictive . One of the songs is very repetitous and yet , it 's one of my favorites . Several other reviewers gave very detailed reviews of each song , and I 'm not going to repeat their efforts here.All in all , I just wanted to say if you have never given Moby a listen , you ought to do yourself a favor and pick up this CD . I think you will find that you wo n't be disappointed .
 This alum is simply amazing . Of course it has probably been over-commercialized ... but thats because its dam good . The mixture of dance , rock , soul , r & b , and electronic is just great . This should be a fixture in anyone 's cd collection . The cd is one of the top 5 in the last 10 years .
 Normally I do n't give 5 stars unless I enjoy almost all the songs . But despite some songs that I do n't like as much , most of the songs are pretty good and a few are amazing . My favorite songs are Porcelain , Inside -LRB- the name is very indicative of the sound -RRB- , the two acoustic songs Everloving and Guitar , Flute & String , and My Weakness . My Weakness is a powerful song that makes me think I 've died and I 'm drifting towards the bright light . These songs make this a great album , and because my least favorite songs are n't that bad , it deserves 5 stars .
 This is an excellent album and one of its best songs -- `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad -- is featured on a new documentary film `` Peaceable Kingdom '' by the production company Tribeofheart.org . This song makes the documentary especially moving ; any fan of Moby should see this and be moved . Amazon sells their other film , `` The Witness '' so I suppose will start selling their new film sometime soon . In the meantime , a preview is available on their webpage . Check it out .
 I bought this CD more than a year ago . I do remember telling my friends that the CD was n't that good . But I listened to it again a few days ago and you know what ? it 's a pretty amazing CD . Especially for me , every song is an amazing song so it tells me it 's not the CD it was me that changed . Every song , tells me that I have changed . I guess I did n't `` play '' it right back then ...
 This is an amazing CD . It 's indescribable . The songs are all recognizable as being by the same artist , yet they 're all different . I 'd recommend this to anybody , regardless of what they say their musical tastes are . Good background music , but also good to listen to intently . Not to be missed .
 I got this CD last Friday and have already listened to it several times . Moby has a unique gift . I love every song on this album from the opening of `` Honey '' with the interesting vocals to the haunting sounds of `` My Weakness '' . He 's the only person who is out there that makes real music anymore it often seems . BUy thisCD even if you 're not a fan of his because you will be after you listen to it .
 A friend of mine recommended that I purchase this CD and I am glad that I did . Being an X-Files fan , I recognized some of the tunes right away which were used in Season 7 . -LRB- I think there was as least one song used in Harsh Realm too , not sure -RRB- Moby is a mixture of Seal and Jan Hammer . His music is soothing and upbeat .
 I have listened to Moby for years and in my opinion is one of the greatest artists of the genre . It surpasses all the Chemical Brothers and Fat Boy Slim . The mixture of ambient/Techno/Blues gives the album a great feel and a very enjoyable listen . If you do n't own this yet do n't hesitate to pick it up .
 It had a great sound . This was a pleasure to listen to . Moved with me at my pace while bringing pleasure to what ever I was doing .
 This guy is just a poet and so driven by words and emotions . It 's so apparent in the way he carries himself and his stage presence that he is no stranger to human emotions be they good or bad . We can all relate to him in some form or fashion . Moby is one to watch and how I wish he 'd come to Houston for a show !!! Be careful what you wish for ... you just might get it .
 this is a masterpiece . a hidden treasure . noone who listens to it ant does not like it had not really opened their mind to such beauty . bur a copy for everywhere you listen to music it will make your life more bearable
 I love Moby and all of his albums . His newest release , `` play '' is a great alternative to all of those boy bands out there today and the beats are great ! If I could give the album more stars then I would in a second .
 I would n't say that this is his best , but it definitely wo n't disappoint . Moby has n't let me down yet , but when I heard about the heavy blues/gospel sampling on this CD , I did n't approach it with high hopes ; however , the sampling was n't as extensive as I 'd been led to believe , and Moby does a good job shaping it into some utterly danceable tracks . The softer pieces are absolutely beautiful , as usual . I ca n't wait for his next one !
 This album shows the growth of an artist . It is not , as mentioned in many other reviews , what you normally expect from Moby which is dance/house . This will disappoint some fans but gain new ones . It shows a desire to try new music art . It succeeds to the greatest degree . He also did a fantastic ambient album as Voodoo Child . No words just haunting melody .
 Play is one of those records that you can take any where . The number of good tracks on it is quite phenomenal ; out of the twenty songs , there is only really one or two that are n't truly wondeful . There is something for whatever mood you 're in , whether you want to party HONEY/BODYROCK/SOUTH SIDE -RRB- or you really just need to chill -LRB- WHY DOES MY HEART ... / INSIDE/NATURAL BLUES -RRB- This is definitely one of the best Records i have ever bought - wonderful !
 This is one of the great Moby CD 's and like his other music he should n't be compared to The Chemical Brothers or anybody else . . He is one of the origional . Enough about that the cd is great to get a party going or just to listen to in the car I suggest you buy it .
 I am not even done listening to every track yet , yet I know this is the one . Moby pretty much pulls off the album of the year . Artists of the likes of Madonna and Beck will be calling this guy for some of his expertise . He has broken ground by creating a beautiful unexpected hybrid
 This is the most amazing CD ever , or at least electronnica . This album has something for any mood you could possibly be in . This will make you want to forget any other artists and go get all of Moby 's other CDs . The last track , `` My Weakness '' sounds like an Enya remix or something . `` Run On '' is one of the best songs I 've ever heard . `` Bodyrock '' sounds like Fatboy Slim on serious crack and `` Honey '' is a great electronic mix . Moby has put together an extroardinary album that anyone who 's ever enjoyed techno should own .
 You got ta love a guy who manages to fuse electronic music with folk and blues and somehow manage to make it sound like a new form of music . Terrific and sparkling and wonderfully original . The album of the year .
 I did not used to care for Moby much . Then I got PLAY . Overall very nice . But the 5 songs that are based on the old Africal Americal Spiritual field recordings ... WOW ! Try this ... play tracks 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , and 11 in a row . Try to sit still . Try not to have chills run down your spine . For these 5 songs alone Moby should be praised extensively . I predict people will be remixing these tracks into even more impressive dance - floor joy-tracks for the next 5 years . And droves of others will copy this idea . Nothing wrong with that , just as long as we remember who showed us how stunningly emotional it can sound.Techno Soul music for the new millenium . Moby can clearly be a genius with the right inspiration . Get it .
 Moby is simply one of the finest , multi-talented artists of our time . Seemingly changing direction at whim and will , he has come back to raveland with a creative vision -- a journey through old school -LRB- really old school -RRB- . By mixing scratchy blues samples , gospel-like vocals/samples , and modern baselines and drum loops , he has grounded his music into a timeless epic . Play will most certainly make everybody critic 's top 5 albums of the year .
 I think it is one of the best CDs I 've ever got . It is unique , alive , real , simple , both tough and sensitive . It is amazing that all 18 songs are that good . You do not have to be just rock , jazz , funk , or whatever to listen to it . It is an experience somebody has to live ... It is primitive rythm !
 In a word
 Moby new album `` Play '' has to be one of the best releases of 1999 . The album contributes beautiful music through many levels . Moby 's delicate sounds are weaved through many genres
 This is one of the years best and certainly the best that Moby has put out . Those that accuse Moby of ripping off blues/gospel are in one word . . jealous ! Sorry you nay-sayers did n't think of it first . From the opening track Moby handles each sample with reverance , surrounding each with either deeply penetrating grooves or transcendent arrangements . A deeply moving much needed reprive from electronicas same ` ol stuff . This record can make the most uptight white boy want to get funky !
 this cd is incredible . it 's both mellow , and at times energetic . it 's soulfull techno , something that 's hard to find . everyone who has ever enjoyed listening to any sort of electronic music should own this cd .
 This CD has some of my favorite songs by Moby on it and is necessary for anyone who likes Moby .
 I find this simple but repetitive tunes to be wonderful and catchy . I 'm hooked ! I was originally exposed to Moby randomly .
 This album has a few different music styles within it . My suggestion , listen to it all the way thru a few times to find the ones ya like , some take a few listens to appreciate .
 Like many I got this after hearing Porcelain , a song that for me -LRB- and I 'm positive many thousands of people -RRB- caught me off guard the first time I heard it . A great song in its entirety . In any case , the rest of this album has a strange mix of gospel-sounding + rap + dance , it 's strange . But it 's very interesting and a solid listen from start to end.This is Moby 's best album that I have heard . 18 , the album following this one , is also very good , but Play is his best . And in 2011 I 'd easily recommend it still , it wo n't sound aged in the least .
 It 's good , when you listen to it . It is a good album to listen to . unless if you do n't like it.i liked it . i gave it 5 happy kissing crowns .
 This was my first Moby CD and I brought it for my fiance 's birthday . We both love it ! We have brought the CD Wait for me and Last Night since then . Moby knocks the socks off of Lady G
 Actually met him at the Diamondsnake premiere concert and talked to him at the VIP party afterwards . Was very cool considering I was a groupie type who 's been obsessed since I was eight . Even gave me a hug and a kiss and me to him ! This is the cd that started the obsession.Good quality , rare skip .
 This album is so cohesive . It sets a tone and puts me into a certain mood that is sustained throughout the entire album . This is surprising because the songs are so different and have so many different emotional elements . Great album !!
 So , Moby 's songs from this disc are on television commercials and movies , and people here are writing about how listening to this disc by Moby is like finding God and how they 've now come to listening to techno thereby ... To anyone who is an electronic purist , with a shelf full of Plaid and Datach ' i and Kid Koala and a bunch of discs from Ninja Tune or Warp or whatever , this CD is something of a disgrace . To anyone who opposes preachy liner notes and self-righteousness , Moby is a disgrace . Nevertheless , there is a reason that it is a huge commercial success . It 's got catchy tunes and makes people happy ; it 's not rife with the kinds of inside jokes and smugness that make Aphex Twin so good to some and so misunderstood to many.The reason that it 's had so much success is that it is a pop album . Moby takes catchy tunes and then places them on top of a soundscape that people can relate too . Artistically -LRB- speaking as if this were a classical album -RRB- he 's got more in common with Gerswhin than Berlio , more in common with N-SYNC than ... well ... I 'm not going to disgrace this review with discussion of popular boy bands ... Who would I recommend this album too ? ` Grown-ups ' who want to listen to new , different music that they need to be not sad . Kids who are into music that kids are traditionally into . I do like this album
 I heard some song on MTV a couple weeks ago by Moby and the CD got good ratings so I bought it . I listened to all of the featured song that were listed on the front cover -LRB- and sound bytes avaliable on this site -RRB- and I could n't find the one song that I really loved . Then I let the tracks run and I was amazed at what I was about to take back . Each song felt like a soundtrack for a moment in life . Whether I was speeding down the highway at sunset or rocking to sleep at night , these songs say all that 's needed to be said for that one moment with barely using a word . Feels almost like a soundtrack for life . I do n't see how anyone could not like a beat like Porclein -LRB- my favorite -RRB- . I really like every song except `` Body Rock '' and `` Honey '' and strangely those are the singles advertised .
 I recently had a spare 10.99 lying around , and with it , I managaed to stumble across THE best album this year ! `` Play '' is by no doubt a varied album , and from this , he combines upbeat and sorrow at the same time , producing a soothing , mind-numbing album . Listen out for `` My Weakness , '' the sheer breath taking crescendo never fails to amaze me . Always deep , always thought provoking , `` Play '' should be a part of everyones music collection .
 Moby has found a way to use technology to ease communication . He uses the same tricks -LRB- sampling & looping -RRB- employed by less accessible electronica masters -LRB- Aphex Twin , Seefeel -RRB- , but the result is anything but hard to enjoy . There is a lot of samples of gospel & blues in the CD , especially in `` Honey '' , `` Find my baby '' , `` Why does my earth feel so bad ? '' , but the palette can get darker -LRB- `` Machete '' , almost heavy metal -RRB- , or very light and athmospheric -LRB- `` Porcelain '' , an apt soundtrack title -RRB- , up to the near-trance mantra of `` My weakness '' . Overall , it 's a hard to classify work , because of the diversity of the songs . It 's not techno , really , and it 's not rock proper . It 's a contamination , in the guise of Beck 's CDs , and it works just fine . It is easy-listening , but stands up well to close , repeated listening.If `` Everything is wrong '' was desperate and frantic , with some slightly pompous themes -LRB- `` Hymn '' , `` Anthem '' -RRB- , this is instead more resigned and calm . The closing point of the album , `` My weakness '' , is maybe the highest . It 's repetitive at first , but its progression is that of a prayer , or rather of an invocation , and the result is a mysterious , affecting melody that will stay with you for a long time .
 This CD is wonderful . I first heard of it from The X-Files and the use of `` My Weakness '' seriously made me cry . It was absolutely BEAUTIFUL .
 Moby takes incredible beats and mixes it with classic blues and folk vocals to create a terrific CD . One of the few CDs I can hear straight through without skipping .
 I LOVE this album . I 've given it away several times - those people have loved it . I 've loaned it to friends who could n't live with out it - they ran out and got it . This is a prize possession and essential addition to your CD collection
 if you have any passion for music or sound in general , and if you 've ever sat down and melted into a song , you want this cd . i 've never been one for harsh dance beats , sometimes what i find on moby cd 's , but this album is another world . the smoothness and flow of this cd - whether it be between songs or at the climax of one individually - remove you from wherever you are and take you somewhere incredible . it is appropriate for any and every activity i can imagine - but i personally like playing it on high volume while i 'm doing any kind of art . makes the moment that much sweeter and more intense . i recommend it with all of my little heart .
 This cd has everything , and makes me feel better when i put it in the cd player .
 Never cared too much for Moby , although I loved the inclusion of ` God Moving Over the Face of the Waters ' at the end of the Pacino/De Niro film ` Heat ' . An amazing moment in cinema history . I remember hearing snippets of this disc all over the place-way before I knew it was Moby . Finally , all the hype got to me I guess , and I bought it . I was not disappointed . This is a wonderful collage of old rustic blues samples , heavy beats , and melancholy keyboard work . I 'm not sure I go quite as far as some in praising this disc , but it is mighty good . There are a few throw-away tracks for me , but on the whole it is solid and compelling . A MUST .
 This album is significant in many ways : Moby licensed out every song on the album , a rarity in today 's day and age . As a matter of fact , it had a lot of people complaining that he had `` sold out . '' As he put it , he wants his music to be heard by the masses . Moby can license out all his music because it is just that good . I love this CD as the music content varies dramatically from some serene music with no vocals to others that are beats with orchestras and his voice to others that are full blown instrumentation . Additionally , his use of other artists with his beats shows his ear for music.Moby is not a `` synth/keyboard freak '' as many just assume his success is due to his keyboarding capability . This guy knows how to put together music and the production of this album was phenomenal . If you want a great bang for the buck album with many songs you have heard on the radio/commercials buy this . You wo n't be disappointed . I hope his next album rocks as much as this one as I have thoroughly enjoyed this one.Listen to the above tracks ... you will find you notice over 1/2 of these songs even if you are n't a Moby fan ... 1 . Honey2 . Find My Baby3 . Porcelain4 . Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad5 . South Side6 . Rushing7 . Bodyrock8 . Natural Blues9 . Machete10 . 711 . Run On12 . Down Slow13 . If Things Were Perfect14 . Everloving15 . Inside16 . Guitar , Flute & String17 . The Sky Is Broken18 . My Weakness
 This is a great CD , blending dance beats and old-fashioned gospel . Much better overall than the single he remade with Gwen Stefani . Buy it .
 It 's a simple CD , the music is good and simple , and it does n't sound just like `` electronic '' music . Moby is creating a new style by mixing gospels and R&B with electronic rythms . If you are interested in following the latest trends , or if you want to make a nice gift to someone , buy this CD .
 I just got this CD , and what a beautiful experience it is listening to it . Leaning back in my easy chair , closing my eyes , visualizing the abstract imagery of each song , and gradually dozing off , it is not an insult to say that this CD put me to sleep . Well , not to sleep exactly ; just a quiet , warm , peaceful frame of mind -- a comfortable twilight . Moby 's PLAY is like a perfect marriage of Enigma and Fatboy Slim
 Moby has complied a great work here . I loved the last track titled , `` My Weakness '' and also the varied other songs within the record . A great work and highly recommended by this country boy .
 This is my first Moby CD and let me tell you it is awesome . I have n't really heard much of his old stuff but that does n't matter because I like this one so much . He really has his own flavor ; some songs are good rock tunes and some are pretty , etc. . What I 'm trying to say is that he has variety and style . So i would recommend it to anyone .
 For sure , play is Moby 's best album . His previous albums were more dance albums . Play is more an album with different styles and very original . ***** continue moby , your great !!
 Electronica can be very boring at times and starts to all sound the same . This is not the average electronica , and sometimes is n't even electronica at all - this album is better . I listen to it all the time . If you liked older songs of his like Hymn and First Cool Hive , you will probably enjoy most of Play . The first two songs are kinda blah , especially the second , but from the beginning of Porcelain all the way to the end of My Weakness it 's just plain good stuff -LRB- with the exception of South Side , that 's not my favorite song in the world -RRB- . I 'm very glad that Moby has stopped making songs like I 'm Feeling So Real , and makes ones like Everloving . This is a very enjoyable album ; South Side is the only real `` Pop '' song on it . After a few listens , you will most likely dig Play -LRB- and if you do , be sure to get the B-Sides -RRB-
 `` The artist that makes others sound bad '' is how I have heard it put by friends after they have listened to this great piece of art created by the vegan that calls himself `` moby '' . This new album is by far the best of moby 's many works.It is certain that it must and will be rememberd in the years to come !
 Wow , this album is an amazing thing . Take smooth grooves , soulful lyrics , engaging drums , and the ability to put it together , and you have this album . Moby is truly showing why he 's such an innovative talent in the electronica genre ... this is something that 's very `` Moby '' , and does n't do anything to try to be popular -LRB- ok , maybe the first single , Bodyrock -RRB- , it just tries to do it 's own thing .
 This cd is great , it also makes for an interesting time if you actually read the whole insert you will find all of moby 's views on things i love his different styles but my favorites are still the faster songs like bodyrock , but yeah , get the cd
 This album is a spirited blend of old blues styles with electronica . It kind of reminds me of R.L. Burnside 's `` Come On In '' but where R.L. is an old blues guy incorporating technological innovations , Moby is a techno guy incorporating blues . This is not as tough as R.L. 's record but it is still a great record .
 This is currently my favorite album -LRB- like you care , but ... -RRB- and for the price it runs , an incredible bargain . Your only problem will be that you will want to pick up a bunch of more Moby and will pay for it ... Great stuff for listening to when cranking out some code as well as just hangin at home reading . If you 're not sure about this whole style of music , worry not . Moby is a very talented musician and his own style shines in this new album.If only I could get my family to listen to music more like this instead of Ricky Martin ... Gim me more !
 This cd is an excellent compilation of songs which originated from the heart of creativity . It is n't hardcore techno , as it may seem at first glance , but more of a techno/alternative mix . Do n't let this fool you though , this cd covers new ground which would leave even some of the biggest pop and rock fans screaming for more . This is defenetly an album that any music lover should add to their collection , if not for the sheer briliance , then for the incredibly flowing and well put-together tracks . My personal favorites on this cd are
 I BOUGHT THIS AFTER HEARING SOME BUZZ ABOUT IN VARIOUS MUSIC MAGS.I WAS VERY DUBIOUS AS I HAVE A LOT OF CDS AND AM TIRED OF SPENDING MY BUCKS ON HYPE WITH NO FULFILLMENT . MOBY IS EXCELLENT , MY FAVORITE CUT SO FAR IS `` FIND MY BABY '' IT 'S SOOOOOO COOL . `` PORCELAIN '' AND `` WHY DOES MY HEART FEEL SO BAD '' ARE ALSO GOOD TRACKS . I LOVE THE ATMOSPHERIC FEEL OF `` PORCELAIN '' IT REMINDS OF YES AND ELO FROM MY YOUTH . THERE IS SO LITTLE ORIGINAL MUSIC THESE DAYS FROM THE MANUFACTURED SAPPY POP OF MS.SPEARS TO EVERY BACKSTREET BOYS BLUNDER MADSQUERADING AS MUSIC . IF YOU ACTUALLY LIKE MUSIC WITH SOUL BUY IT NOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! P.S. SORRY ABOUT THE SPELLING .
 yeah ... moby created some great stuff , with some fantastic sounds and a great music environment , well done . just turn off the lights and enjoy , the trip is about to begin ...
 I am listening to this recording right now and I must say it is begging me to abandon my keyboard and dance . This album has captured my heart . The loops constructed of smithsonian-type field recordings are not only inventive but irresistable . This is the best electronia album I know of and it represents the best of a great genre of music .
 I 'm totally new to Moby , but a couple of tracks that he has on the `` Heat '' soundtrack and some overwhelmingly positive criticial reviews made me take a chance on this album . `` Play '' is absolutely entrancing . Portishead 's great album `` Dummy '' has a similar feel to it and I hear echoes of Eno and Roxy Music 's `` Avalon '' on it . BUT this work stands on its own . It immediately gets under your skin , into your bloodstream and inside your subconscious . It is romantic , quietly epic and softly but unmistakebly intense . This is one of the great albums of the decade .
 This album rocks , this album is hot . Of course , this all is my opinion but I think `` Play , '' by Moby , is probably the best CD I 've bought sense Nine Inch Nails ' `` The Fragile ; '' and if I excluded NIN 's amazing follow up to The Downward Spiral I 'd say Play is the best album I 've heard , and bought in the last five , maybe seven years . Not only does the music on this disc come together as an intriguing , effecting , cool whole , but each song itself stands as an individual masterpiece in the quality of it 's uniqueness , it 's versatility . And not only does each song lack the imitation of it 's proceeder , but each song fits into the massive whole with a different combination , always placing it one step above the next . This album literally gets better with every song ; and separately , each song gets better with the audible viewing of the one ahead of it . The song , `` My Weakness '' is truly heavenly , and sounds as if the ocean is singing to you . Play , by Moby , is highly recommended by me .
 When first reading about this album the word techno was often brought up . When I think of techno , club hopping , disco dancing music is what I imagine . It must be understood that this CD is not the above kind of music . The use of synthetic music machines allows this album to fall into the `` techno '' genre.This CD is truly different and a great listen . Whether you want to relax or just let your mind run free - this CD is for you ! Each track is even more original than the other . It 's almost impossible to fully explain what you can achieve from this album ... It wo n't make you a millionaire but it will enlighten your soul and let your thoughts run wild . Grab this album if your looking for something different . This is not really an album you would dance or sing along to ... It 's an album you sit back and enjoy !
 I bought this album after hearing Natural Blues on the radio , and then hearing bits and pieces of other songs in various places , such as commercials . This is one of the most brilliant albums I have ever heard . What people do n't realize is that this is NOT a techno album . While he may be notorious for previous CDs that were , this is not something that is the same thing over and over and over for ten minutes . Each song is beautifully put together , some with more emotion than others , but all very very good . True , there are some songs that are just little songs of him playing the guitar -LRB- Guitar , Flute & String -RRB- and humming along , but you can tell that he made this album from his heart . After reading the insert and gaining knowledge about who this man is , I was really able to appreciate him more as a person than just somebody mixing songs and putting an album together . If you do n't like bluesy , soulful music , it 's not for you . If you like beautiful rhythms and catchy beats , it is DEFINITELY for you . It 's worthy every penny !
 This album was very versitile . Their are sad songs -LRB- Natural Blues , etc. -RRB- , funny songs -LRB- Honey , etc. -RRB- , and dance songs -LRB- Bodyrock , etc. -RRB- . I 'm not into much techno but I loved `` Play '' . In most techno it 's just a bunch of repetitve beats throughout the whole cd . Moby brings versitality and variety into techno . Moby is a one of a kind techno artist . He 's been around for about a decade , more than most of the techno artists , and he has more experiance . I think he is the best techno artist around . In a normal techno album I get bored after the second track . I can listen to `` Play '' any time I want for as long as I want . The only flaw is that it is still techno and I do n't like techno much but I still gave it five stars . Please buy this album . It is great for all music fans , from metal fans to classical fans , from rap fans to jazz fans . I reccomend this to absolutely everybody . A - -LRB- It is still techno . -RRB-
 I think one of the reasons why Moby 's music has become hot lately is because the diversity of all of his albums . One of 2 discs by Moby in 1997 had a dance - hard beat to it . `` Play '' had many songs on it I 've heard before I bought it . I heard `` Run On '' first , then `` Bodyrock , '' `` Natural Blues '' `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad '' and so on . After that , my favorite track , even on the whole album `` Porcelain '' and the beautiful words to `` South Side . '' The tracks on this album are those that get the imagery in your mind . He was nominated for Best Male Video for a VMA but did n't quite win . My dad loves his songs too . On MTV2 was what convinced me to buy it , and it 's not redundant like Fatboy Slim . This is like African-American folk mixed with dance , electronic , techno , and rock . This is also comparable to BT 's `` Movement In Still Life '' though this is less repetitive in the chorus . This is stuff i 'd expect to hear at a dance club . Also hip-hop is mixed to it . This is a good effort , on his 6th album . Also `` I Like To Score , Moby 's other '97 release , has songs featured on certain soundtracks . He also mixes guitars , and did every instrument on this album .
 I was completely blown away when I first heard this cd . My roommate at the time owned this cd and I just loved hearing it everytime he played it , especially `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad ? '' . `` Southside '' on this edition of `` Play '' sounds so much better with Moby 's vocals alone as opposed to the new mix with Gwen Stefani -LRB- of No Doubt -RRB- . There is n't one song on this cd that I hate . Not a huge fan of `` Bodyrock '' but it is still a good song . `` Natural Blues '' and `` Porcelain '' are other faves along with the more ambient tracks towards the end of the cd . I have yet to hear a cd where the critical praise is well deserved as Moby 's Play has received .
 This entire CD in wonderful -LRB- well , not number 2 . I hate it . Regardless . -RRB- . Everyone should buy it and marvel . Not just the songs that made it to the radio are great - they all are . And different too . buyitbuyitbuyitbuyitbuyitbuyit
 Epic , startling , experimental , and ever-shifting . There are a few missteps , but the amazing soaring heights than make up for these few lows . It soothes , and it energizes , the production is handled beautifully , and sound quality is of the highest calibre . This is absolutely an album not to be missed , everyone should give this one a good look . Do n't lend it out though , I just got mine back after four months of missing it . It 's addictive and memorable . Oh yeah , and I love the album design , though the essays are somehow inappropriate . The pic of Moby on the back is priceless . standouts
 An odd little vegan with some naive but noble beliefs wreaks havoc in the musical industry . Why ? Because he is special . What makes Moby special is beyond me . His songs are not inordinately complex nor is there anything revolutionary that we have not heard before . What Moby has plenty of is SOUL and EMOTION . Porcelin was the most dreamy enchanting song I 've heard all year without a doubt . And the rythmn and Muddy waters blues theme contained in `` why does my heart feel so bad '' has one unconscosciously tapping his feet and nodding emphatically . This is why this man is good for music . How many million people have rediscovered soul and funk again because of the variant modernised interpretions offered by Moby ? It must be said that some of the tracks do sort of wander off and peter out like a stream flowing into the Sahara desert would , which is the only reason this does not get a 5 star review -RRB- but there is definitely enough inspiring material to keep the listener entertained , intruiged and pleased.The variation on offer also adds to the mystique of the artist . By the way , `` Bodyrock '' should be played very very loud on a dance floor for full appreciation !
 This artist must be some kind of genius ! He has taken fabulous blues/gospel sound bytes and married them to incredible techno tracks . I was taken over by this album ... it owns me , is in my head all the time . All it took was hearing two songs on a local radio station `` Porcelain '' and `` Natural Blues '' to know I had to hear more , but I was not prepared for how much more I got on `` Play '' ! Buy this one if you want music that you will never tire of , will marvel over for years to come .
 18 tracks of brilliance from the most energetic man in pop . every one 's a winner .
 I have never really liked Moby very much , I accually still think he 's a little on the wacko side , but this man really knows his stuff . As soon as I turned on the CD , I was hooked by `` Honey '' . I also enjoyed songs like `` Bodyrock '' `` Nateral Blues '' `` Porcelain '' and `` Rushing '' . The beats and rythems in his songs are amazing and will always get your toe tapping . On the other hand , the 2nd half of this CD is kind of weak . I enjoy the first half of the Cd more then the 2nd half . But still , eather you are a fan of mixes like this , or even if you do n't really enjoy it , you will more then likely enjoy this wonderful colaberation of music by Moby .
 before Moby I considered techno only music to dance to late into the night , but not to listen to on my stereo . This disc changed that . Stunning . I dig porcelain , southside , run on , bodyrock and my weakness the most . Go Moby go .
 I purchased the cd mainly for `` Natural Blues '' which immediately caught my attention on the radio , with its catchy rhythm and haunting vocals -LRB- later , I learned the vocals were sampled from an old blues record -RRB- . I was n't expecting a whole lot from the rest - after all , I was a bit dubious buying a cd from an artist whose acronym stands for `` Master Of Beat Y' all '' . I really was n't into the `` hip-hoppy-rappy-scratchy record stuff '' , but Moby has helped to build the bridge for me to do this music cross-over . He definitely has talent for piecing music together , creating a wonderful sonic tapestry of urban , soul , ambient , and techno with the right combinations of each for my musical tastes . The old blues and gospel sound sampling , though by no means a new technique , is done with nice effect , enhancing and giving his music a certain visceral quality without detracting from it . I 'm a progressive music fan with very eccentric musical tastes , and this cd ranks pretty high in my collection . I never would have imagined .
 This CD is so original . The slower songs sound like a catchy modern blues that is completely irrestible , and the fast songs are quite easy to dance to . I found myself identifying with the lyrics , they were written well , and the music itself is retro and futuristic , calming and exhilirating , and better and best . : -RRB-
 Moby alias Richard Melville Hall was the first one to take the cover off of techno scene in 1991 with his ` Go ' . He was/is considered as the voice and look of techno music . But that was in the beginning . Then came Twin Peaks ' theme , ` Thousand ' and ` Hymn ' ; the last one being the first marker indicating towards ` Play ' . What can I say about this album except that it is brilliant . Album has something for everyone . ` Honey ' & ` Find My Baby ' for bigbeat-blues lovers , ` Porcelain ' & ` South Side ' for those who like indie-pop and ` Machete ' & ` Body Rock ' if you want to get energy.The other part of the album is totally -LRB- and I mean totally -RRB- full of heavenly ambient . At least as good - and maybe even better - as Orbital . To me this part should 've been on ` The Beach ' soundtrack.This album is certainly the best to date from Moby and to me it was one of the best of 1999 . He just know how to work the right way with all those sounds and instruments to create powerful and magnificent background for the month after you have brought it . Go out , buy it and play it !
 the good thing about Moby is that as he goes along in the song he keeps on adding new elements into the song . instead of just playing the same thing over and over for four minutes straight but he does use the same words through out the song . but you do n't really notice because he keeps on adding to the music . if you like the songs they play on the radio you will like the rest of his songs .
 This is what music means . Moby manages through -LRB- really pretty sparse -RRB- beats and samples to evoke a whole range of emotions on this excellent CD . Bought it for `` Porcelain , '' which is excellent , but other highlights include `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad , '' `` Natural Blues , '' `` Bodyrock , '' the very beautiful `` My Weakness , '' and I have to mention my personal amazola song , `` The Sky Is Broken , '' which is basically Moby talking ina dark , moody voice over a naked background beat that shows up once in a while to punctuate the spooky darkness that Moby creates . Sounds like it should be in an episode of the X-Files . Maybe it was and I missed it . After that , Moby basically weeps through the music on `` My Weakness '' 'S a brilliant album . Definitely reminds you that sure , you can sing along to Brittany , but real music will evoke emotions in you . In this area Moby scores bigtime .
 This is the perfect CD to listen to whenever you have the blues . Most of the tracks are calm and relaxing . Do n't be tricked by the Bodyrock single , there 's only a couple songs like that ... There are not many CDs out there that actually leave you feeling changed and transformed . This is one of them .
 Never have I heard a CD that was so void of labels . How do you classify Moby ? His first major release , Everything Is Wrong , would be Dance/Techno . Then came That 's When I Reached for My Revolver , which was more punk rock . But his latest album , Play , is like no other . Moby takes elements of classic blues and gospel samples and blends them with a modern day techno blues mix ... if that 's possible . It is such an ecclectic mix of music from the popability of Bodyrock , to the slightly unnerving Run On . Many times the gospel vocals invoke a tragic feeling to the songs like Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad ? This is a CD that trancends all music to inspire and force other musicians to equal the artistic brilliance that Moby show with this album . He manages an almost rock-like Find My Baby to lead into the beauty that is Porcelain . Play in undoubtedly one of the best albums of the year , and simply a must have for any music fans .
 While surfing through stations on TV one evening I tuned into PBS and was just thrilled with the music from this artist.I had never heard of him before so I went to my music expert -LRB- my 20yo daughter -RRB- and she gave him rave reviews . Moby is for everyone whether you are 46 or 20 ! The entire CD is good not just one or two songs.He is truely on the brilliant side especially live . I would love to see him in concert sometime.Get this one . You will love it.I am 99.9 % sure of it !
 The great `` iconoclast of techno '' has returned with `` Play '' , a masterpiece of an album . No doubt one of the top 5 albums of 1999 and probably one of the best of the 90s , `` Play '' is almost an unclassifiable genre . A blend of electronica , blues , soul , gospel and techno -LRB- among others . . -RRB- , the album 's outstanding rhythms and catchy melodies will make you listen to the album over and over.The album starts of with `` Honey '' , a great opener . The omnipresent piano and guitar plucking will have you loving the song right from the start . After `` Find my Baby '' , you get to the album 's gem , `` Porcelain '' . `` Porcelain '' 's violin and piano parts are , simply put , gorgeous . It 's one of those songs that creates such an unbelievable mood and atmosphere when you listen to it . If you want to really enjoy and get the most out of it , take my advice
 This January 1999 release from Moby is widely regarded as his best or at least his most ambitious work to date , winning a `` Best of the 90s '' status from Spin , Rolling Stone , The Onion 's AV Club and , interestingly enough , The Des Moines Register . Well known in the rave-techno-ambient-electronica scene , Moby 's music shows the future direction of this genre and probably much else too . It 's not just the music of rave clubs anymore . It is the music of a mass-society that finds itself awash in voices , information , and echoes from a cultural history that has turned increasingly inward . Play 's subtleties -- buried samples and sonic textures -- allow the medium to comment on the message.Play 's liner notes contain Moby 's views on Fundamentalism , prisons and crime , his Vegan diet , the holocaust , and non-Pacificist Christians . He also lists a number of quotes from world religious leaders about animals . He adds , `` These essays are not really related to the music , so if you hate the essays , you might still like the music , and if you like the essays you might hate the music . Who knows , maybe by some bizarre twist of fate you 'll like them both . '' Moby 's views on animals as food may not pertain to the tracks on Play , but there is no doubt that his spiritual orientation does pertain . Composed of Philip Glass-like minimalist melodies and samples from Hip-Hop artists , old Blues and Gospel songs , Play employs the materialist-spawned tools of what Walter Benjamin called the Age of Mechanical Reproduction in order to engage our digitized souls in a sustained self-examination . Play begins with `` Honey '' -LRB- sampled from Bessie Jones ' `` Sometime '' -RRB- which leads into `` Find my Baby '' -LRB- Boy Blue 's `` Joe Lee 's Rock '' -RRB- . Both songs have some heavy synthesizer overlays that establish one of the album 's motifs along with a theme of loss and longing for the return of a lover . `` Porcelain , '' an intimate confession of dreams of death and jealousy , a song of farewell and regret -LRB- vocals by Moby -RRB- , opens with the heavy synth , acquires a slow beat , and finally a piano melody tripping out note by note that re-emerges in many of the later tracks . `` Why does my heart feel so bad ? '' -LRB- Shining Light Gospel Choir -RRB- asks that question again and again , the contemporary equivalent of a liturgical recitative . `` Southside , '' words and vocals by Moby , describes a dark day and night marked by endless cycles of routine
 Moby has changed the face of music with this album by mixing techno , church spirituals , and classical music . Moby can be really creative with this album and can perform great instrumentals along with mixing . My favorite tracks are Bodyrock , South Side , Natural Blues , Porcelain , Find My Baby , and My Weakness . It is n't really a dance album , it 's more of an electronic soundtrack . On a 12-hour road trip I went on , I listened to this entire CD and enjoyed most of the songs as I was bored in the car . If you truly like music , do not miss the opportunity to get this album . This album is absolutely amazing from a man that produces REAL music . I recommend this album to good music listeners who have tastes in all kinds of music and for those who have nothing to listen to on a long car trip .5 stars is my rating and there is no good reason why you can not rate this album one star . -LRB- Unless you are a big fan of grunge rock music or boy band oriented pop -RRB-
 Please , whatever you do , do not be put off by the album 's ` techno ' classification . I thought about buying it when I heard everyone raving about it a while back but then I read reviews which said it was a techno album , and I am not a fan of dance or techno music . So , I put off buying it . After hearing one excellent single too many , I took the plunge . I am so glad I bought it . I was only expecting to like a few tracks , but I was in for a real surprise . Nearly all of the tracks are superb . ` Techno ' is quite simply the last category I would put this album into . This album is so unique that it can not really be classified . Moby is obviously very talented musically . Every song on this album is of a high quality , and there are some fantastic stand-out tracks , most noticably the blues-inspired `` Run On '' and the gorgeous , lush , mellow track `` Porcelain '' . There are a few upbeat tracks on the album , but I even like these . One sincerely hopes Moby is able to use his talents to produce more records like this in the future . If you are in doubt as to whther this album is worth the cash , plese let me assure you it is . You will almost certainly recognise many tracks , as movies , advert and TV shows have been using these songs . You 'll have to buy the album to understand how good it is . The range of styles and instruments Moby uses is huge , and the result is truly a classic . You will not be disappointed .
 Moby 's latest CD `` Play '' is an incredible collection of music that moves your feet , mind and heart . There 's not a weak cut on the album , although a couple of the songs come in at under 2:00 long . I 'm hard to please when it comes to music and this is the finest I 've heard in YEARS . Buy it and love it !
 Play , is without a doubt , my favourite release of 1999 . Moby has done it again . Took off from the last disc , I Like To Score , and went in a new direction . True , some tracks have the electronica-meets-blues vibe , but all of these tracks -LRB- Honey , Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad , Run On -RRB- are good enough to stand on their own , rather than being grouped into `` one of Moby 's bluestechno songs '' category . But there is FAR more than these songs on this disc . Moby Does straight techno excellently -LRB- ie
 I bought this CD without having any idea what to expect . I had never heard of Moby . I simply had read a review of the `` Best CD 's of the Decade '' , which cited Spin Magazine 's claim that Moby 's PLAY was within the top 10 . Well , I felt brave . Willing to take a risk and try something different -LRB- I loved Fatboy Slim , so I figured , what the hey -RRB- , I bought it . LOVED IT IMMEDIATELY . What an excellent CD . And as some other reviewers stated already , you ca n't put a label on Moby 's style of music . I recently caught part of an HBO `` Reverb '' during which Moby made an appearance . I can only hope that he will return to Columbus for a repeat performance . He is so talented . Multi-dimensional . This CD is great for anyone who wants something a bit different . It 's fun , funky , mellow , everything in between .
 I feel like I have always subconsciously been a Moby fan even though I neglected to buy one of his CDs until just now . I do n't really know what kept me away for so long , to tell anyone who cares the truth , because his music is so refreshing . Well , I dare not forget to mention that his music has been the background for so many of those intense , climatic -LRB- and countless -RRB- moments in television dramas and Adidas commercials . But ... I have always been a sucker for great song placement , so here I am praising this record.To actually talk about ` Play ' now , I must say that it is truly an exceptional record in all respects . I feel like it has a little bit of everything -- hypnotizing instrumentals , haunting vocal hooks , and superior dance grooves -LRB- did I really just use that word ? -RRB- -- that even a casual listener can be moved by . This album is truly a must-have for anyone 's collection.I know that Moby is mostly labeled in the `` techno '' realm -- for good reason of course , because well , let 's face it ... he 's not much of a rapper -- but I think `` techno '' can be a harsh word . It automatically throws you into a category with club DJs and mind numbing , repetitive bass thuds . I think Moby 's tracks have much more depth than the word `` techno '' can imply . There is something almost inspirational or even enigmatic about songs like `` Porcelain '' and `` Why does my heart feel so bad ? '' Others , like `` Honey '' and `` Run on '' are pretty darn fun . `` Bodyrock '' , of course , is a classic I-want-to-play-any-sport-in-slow-motion-to-it song ... but I really did n't need to tell anyone that . `` Natural Blues '' is creepily beautiful , while `` The Sky is broken '' is just creepy ... I love ` em . `` Guitar flute & string '' is just that ... if this song is techno , I ca n't seem to find a beat to shake it like a Polaroid picture to-it 's very innovative.All in all , I found ` Play ' to be a perfect record . Plus ... as a definite bonus , it sounds GREAT in the car . Okay , I 'm done.P.S . I am also an Eminem fan ... I 'm just saying .
 Moby is a genius when it comes to creating , mixing and layering sounds . Some songs on this CD exude with a ghostly nostalgia , -LRB- track 4 and track 18 -RRB- echoing the kind of emotions that feel more and more surreal as they intensify . He also manages to create frantic , fast-paced beats without resorting to the kind of audial flashiness that sound like they belong at some dance club . `` Play '' is by turns soothing in it 's simplicity , beguiling in it 's originality , and rousing in it 's sensationalism . I was really impressed with the way Moby 's songs unfold in a very natural way , the noises and sounds entwine gracefully 100 % of the time . You do n't have to be a techno fan to appreciate this kind of music , it 's pretty much a mood language that anyone can indulge in .
 You 'd never have guessed Moby has been around for years . This is his first album which has made it big despite underground recognition with his previous efforts . The reason this album 's made it
 Wow . `` Play '' is one of those albums which begins to creep in quietly and slowly gets under the listener 's skin and into their head . After listening to the album once through , you ca n't help but start back at the beginning and cycle through the tracks again and again . And again . Re - `` Play '' value is through the roof on this album ; the music in `` Play '' is so rich and complex , you can hear new aspects of each track after listening dozens of times . Conversely , the premise of the album is deceptively simple . Moby takes his famed beats and runs archived vocals of blues musicians over them . The result is astounding . `` Play '' is one of the best albums released in years . For an album featuring decades-old vocals , it is unbelievably refreshing and invigorating .
 I have been a Moby fan since 1994 . A friend of mine introduced me to Moby 's `` Move '' and I was hooked . Over the years , I have aquired quite a Moby collection . Most artists do n't get better over the years but Moby has . `` Play '' is an example of this . At first , I did n't think I 'd like `` Play '' because it was much softer and mellow than Moby 's previous works . But Moby carries the same passion and spirituality in his softer works , as he does in his harder/louder works . I personally love all the songs on the cd ... each song flows into the other perfectly . `` Porcelain '' is a beautiful song and we get to hear Moby sing which is nice . Moby also made a very powerful video for `` Porcelain '' which is definitely worth seeing . Christini Ricci plays an angel in it . `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad '' contains the haunting but beautiful piano background which Moby uses through many of his softer works . `` Machete '' has a perfect fit on the cd because it raises the energy level after softer works . `` My Weakness '' is an amazingly beautiful song and a great way to close the album . When I heard that song for the first time , I felt I knew what God would feel like . I had such an overwhelming feel of spirituality during that song , like angels were lifting me . I could go on and on about each song , but basically this album makes you feel good . It enlightens you , and it 's perfect to listen to anytime . For other great Moby albums , `` Everything Is Wrong '' is a must , `` Move '' is great , Moby 's first cd ever `` Moby '' is worth buying because of `` Help Me To Believe '' and `` Go . '' Which `` Go '' by the way is an early `` Moby '' song but one of his best . It has the haunting `` Twin Peaks '' theme in it . And for those of you who can catch Moby in concert , I saw him this past fall and it was one of the best shows I 've ever been to . Lots of beautiful lighting , intense energy level - Moby himself commands such a presence on stage . It was an amazing experience .
 i bought this cd used , just a few weeks after it came out -LRB- i guess someone did n't like it , their loss -RRB- . i had n't heard much of moby 's stuff other than his dance-y material but this was a welcome surprise . it 's musical beauty permeates your soul and fills one with goodness -LRB- i know that sounds cheesy -RRB- . moby does a wonderful job with the voice samples he uses and his mellow , slow instrumentals are his best yet -LRB- i favor track 14 , everloving -RRB- .
 I bought this CD because I read on this web page that this was the best selling CD and there was a lot of good reviews . I have never bought or really heard Moby before but I have read some interesting stuff about him . Right away I recognized a couple of songs . I noticed when browsing for some new techno that many people who bought the CDs I did , also bought this one . My friend told me `` its kinda slow at first so give it a listen to '' . Personally I like the first few songs the best . They are worth the price of the CD . I think the end gets a little slow . Good sound on this recording - excellent production from beginning to end ! Good music to get the ladys dancing . Good music to chill with your woman -LRB- like smoke some hoochy and get your groove on , ya know what I 'm sayin ? -RRB- then after y' all have been at it for a while , the end kinda mellows out as you smoke your last cigarette and go to sleep . I want to buy some more Moby !
 Rarely does an album of this genre verge on brilliance , but Moby has pulled off something quite unique with Play . It is an album which draws upon many influences and styles which on paper really should n't work , but on Play it all flows so perfectly . It covers a wide range of emotions from summer bliss to pure and edgy electro . Sampled blues vocals are used so effectively on this album which is demonstrated on the haunting single Natural Blues , but strong melodies is the key to the album 's success . Lush orchestral chords dominate most of the tracks with delicate piano that simply reaches the parts of the mind that other albums fail to reach . As soon as the album comes to a memorable close , you will find yourself immediately hitting the repeat button of your cd player . A perfect soundtrack to those long summer evenings and so infectious . Highlights include the beautiful Porcelian and Rushing which you will want to hear over and over . Moby has created an album full of complex soundscapes , and if you buy just one album in the year 2000 , make it Play .
 I 'm a stick-in-the-mud who does n't stray far from my favorite genres of classical , big band , and swing , so I was reluctant to give in to my son who HOUNDED me to buy this CD after hearing `` My Weakness '' on The X-Files . Well folks , Moby 's music has knocked me off my center -- the music is full of tradition and innovation , blended beautifully . It feels like warm day with friends . I can not stop playing it . Please try this CD .
 I have taken the unusual -LRB- for me -RRB- step of buying two copies ... one for my car and one for work . Moby is a genius , and the music is inspirational . Definitely on my Top 5 for 1999 !
 Finally there is an artist who know 's how to describe what it is like to fall in love .
 From the second I heard the song `` Porcelain , '' I knew that I needed to own this album . Since I 've bought it for myself , I 've also bought it for 3 other people . It 's one of those discs that you just need to own because you 'll never know when you 'll need it . It 's like a lozenge on a sore throat - cool , soothing , mellow and fresh , adding a little peace to your life . `` Porcelain '' remains my favorite song on the album . There could n't be a better name for a song , because it 's so smooth and so silky , it can take you to a whole other place , if only for a few minutes . Other notables include the soul-searching `` Why does my Heart . . ? '' and the hip-hop flavored `` South Side . '' Other aspects of the album explore religion , with songs like `` Run On , '' and purely instrumental and more classical tunes like `` Guitar , Flute & String , '' a haunting melody that brings the album to a nice close.I gave this album 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel that a little goes a long way and Moby could have shaved some songs off the final cut . The album starts off with a bang and keeps the interest of the listener until track `` Run On . '' After that , the songs start melting into each other . While they are individually beautiful songs , I think that they could have been saved for a rainy day .
 Very rarely does an album come along that has superb songs for every track . I first heard Moby on David Letterman and I thought that he had a very interesting sound . If I only knew how much Moby 's CD Play would effect my life . When I got the CD for Christmas in 1998 I was curious on what the entire CD would sound like . Then the moment I pushed that play button on my stereo I was hooked for weeks . Before I knew it I was playing Play every live long day . Honey , Machete , My Weakness , Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad , Bodyrock , and Porcelain all should be known as classics . The CD became a soundtrack for my life . After hearing Play I then bought Moby 's other CD , entitled Moby . I did n't really care for that one . But I did buy the best of Moby 1993-1998 and loved every bit of it . I just ca n't wait untill Moby creates another masterpiece like Play . It would definetly be on the very top of my anything list .
 This is one of the most interesting albums I 've ever come across . Most of the songs really feel like extended samples , but all of them are really cool to listen to . Every song has a different beat and style than all of the other songs . This will be like nothing you 've heard before . Natural Blues and Bodyrock are two of the singles from the CD which you can listen to over and over again . What is so great about this CD is that you can listen to this CD straight throught without even skipping . Get it now !!
 I have heard many people try to classify `` Play '' into a single category . This is impossible . Moby has created one of the most musically diverse albums I have ever heard -LRB- the others being R.E.M. 's `` Up , '' Beck 's `` Odelay , '' and Radiohead 's `` Kid A '' -RRB- . At over an hour in length , it may seem difficult at first to listen to the album all the way through , but to do so is extremely rewarding . It is especially fun to try and locate where on the album the `` genre changes '' take place . Songs like `` Honey , '' `` Bodyrock , '' and `` My Weakness '' seem as if they were made by different artists , and when listened to individually , they definitely do not feel like they should be on the same album . But this is what makes the album so great . Moby completely threw out the rules and created an album the way he wanted to , not the way some DJ would want him to . One of the best things about the album is not musically related at all . The liner notes contain several essays written by Moby himself , on topics such as veganism , fundamentalism , and laws regarding drug use . Fascinating stuff . Buy this album . You will be a better person for it .
 The simple title , PLAY , reveals the humble man and group MOBY . Playful in conception , this CD ca n't be classified in just one category of techno , or rock , or blues ; it 's a unique collection of all . The varied instruments , synthesizer and strings ... produce beautiful , neat musical sounds that pulse through my body . Vocals with minimalist lyrics -LRB- in most songs -RRB- throb in my mind . The women 's supernatural voices are perfectly matched with the songs . I love this CD and Moby Songs and Moby Moby . These are the songs I 'll associate the new millenium . Play is all I do ... everything is play ... so naturally I love this one .
 Each and every song is worth listening to . Is an excellent buy .
 this is an excellent album for anyone . its definitely a two part album , with the first half filled with the unique field holler/blues sampling , the second with slower and more emotional tracks . watch for porcelein , southside -LRB- good guitar solos -RRB- , bodyrock , if things were perfect , and inside .
 This review is for those that are n't into tecno music . Previous purchases have left me feeling cold , most notably the Chemical Brothers . There were just too many mind numbing beats that seemed to be composed specifically for a party environment . This is the first tecno CD that has found its way into my permenant collection . The amount of soul and emotion that is in this album is astounding , particularly on porcelin and Natural Blues . I can actually sit and listen to this CD without getting tired of it . The only reason I do n't give it five stars is that the second half seems to wander . There are a few successive songs with slow beats and minimal melody . Other than that , I think this CD was well worth my money .
 A friend bought this cd for me and I really did not expect to like it . I enjoy music of many kinds but am a conservative 47-year-old mother and thought Moby was going to be too `` techy '' for me . I have three children , ages 14 , 19 , and 20 , and a very musically-conservative 47-year-old husband who all consider `` Play '' to be their favorite cd . We are an enthusiastic fan family and highly recommend this wonderful cd .
 For anyone who loves music , this CD is a must . It is not all techno as you might expect ... Instead , it is a deep , passionate look at the music today . Each song on the CD is completely different , and reflects hundreds of different moods that each person may have . I find this CD to be one of the best buys I have ever made in my life ! Listen and Love ! - Raven
 One of the things I enjoy about Moby is his ability to provoke emotion without the use of words , lyrics , or vocals . Instruments are all he needs , and that 's proven several times on this album , with songs like Inside , Guitar Flute & String , but most of all
 I picked up this album after hearing the song `` Natural Blues '' on the radio . For some reason , I set it aside , but I have just recently come back to it , and have found out just how amazing this album is . From start to finish , there is a variety of musical genres that allow any listener to be entertained . While I prefer the soft instrumental songs like `` Guitar Flute and String , '' `` Everloving , '' and `` My Weakness , '' other tracks , such as `` Porcelain '' and `` Natural Blues '' stand out as masterpieces . These five songs alone are reason enough for anybody to buy this album , but it does n't end there . The only song I do n't like from this album is `` Machete '' , which seems to be too high-tempo for the rest of the album . Other standout songs for me include `` Inside , '' `` Run On , '' and `` The Sky is Broken . '' Every song on this album -LRB- save perhaps Machete -RRB- is revolutionary in that it defies classification into one genre . This is an album that everybody can enjoy.BEST SONGS
 Moby has come along way from his very first album entitled ` Moby ' which was his early techno works to his most recent album ` Play ' . We got a taste of what Moby can really do with ambient music , pop-techno , dance , and rock in albums such as
 Pre - `` Play , '' I was not a big dance-music listener . When my roommate at college said he was waiting for the new Crystal Method album to come out in a couple months , I had to admit that I had no idea who it was he was talking about . Determined to broaden my musical horizons , he handed me `` Play '' by Moby . I had already heard a lot of the stuff on it ; `` Honey , '' `` Bodyrock , '' and `` South Side , '' just to name a few , but this was the first time I really listened to it . Then I listened to it again . After a little while I was hooked , not just on this CD but the B-Sides as well -LRB- another amazing album , by the way . -RRB- Soon I bought my own copy , incredulous to the fact that I had so narrow a vision on the music of Moby before I had the chance to slap on my headphones and experience it.Spin Magazine named this the # 20 album of the decade , and with good reason . It DOES sport about 7 singles , ranging from his old semi-ambient style , to hard dance , to pop , to pure moods . But the most impressive is the albums solidarity ; no bad tracks on it . And along with the B-Sides , it is one of the great musical concoctions of my time . Enjoy.Oh , by the way , for those writers who call this overblown or pretensious ; Ok , I respect the opinion and all . But if an album is this good , would n't it be hard for radio stations NOT to overplay it a little ?
 I originally bought play for `` Bodyrock '' and found the rest of the album to be very different than I expected . At first I was disappointed since many of the songs are composed of repeating samples and music , but after listening to it more I began to greatly enjoy all of the tracks . The music is very diverse , ranging from the very catch `` Bodyrock '' track to some of the softer instrumentals such as `` Everloving '' . Play has turned out to be one of my favorite recent purchases .
 I saw Moby live recently & was amazed by his complex style . His music ranges from soul to full-assault techno to a sort of ambient/dancehall blues . ` Play ' shows off this unique prodigy at his latest & finest -- combining mix-matched styles & samples . The best record I 've heard in 1999 so far .
 Having only just discovered Moby as an artist , I can definately conclude that my head has been filled with recycled pop chart tracks that will be forgotton in years to come . Moby is here to stay and this ablum proves it . This is definately one of the sexiest , brilliant albums of the year , a winner as background music , bedroom music and discman music . Moby makes me feel like I am in an exotic country and moving in slow-motion , it makes you stop and take a closer look . Funky tracks like Honey , Body Rock and Machete will provide that extra edge to each footstep and make you want to move your body in ways you never imagined . My personal favourites are the mellow spiritual tracks which reach deep within
 Ok . This new album didnt touch me like EVERYTHING IS WRONG did , but it is 5 times greater than GO or ANIMAL RIGHTS.Someone in one of the -LRB- over 300 -RRB- reviews of this album said that Moby was ripping off the Gospel community with the samples on this record . Let me explain that Mr Moby is a Christian so if he samples a gospel album to get his message out , the gospel community should be thankful . Nuff said.Moby is the Utne Reader of the Techno Beat Underground ... He has a mind and he 's not afraid to use it . The tracks on here at first sound clumsy and akward but after repeat listens they get comfortable and more embraceable . I give Moby credit for being courageous enough to come out , as Christian , and Vegan and Bisexual . I can totally dig someone who walks the talk and stands up for their beliefs . 3 cheers for the little idiot . Hip hop hooray ! Hip hop Hooray ! Hip hop Hooray!This album is worth your moolah simply for the liner notes . The block rockin beats are the frosting on the cake ...
 The songs on this CD are more like ` songs ' than your average techno . The songs have many layers , vocals , and lots of melody . There is none of the usual long periods of beats with no change . You have probably heard the songs Porcelain and Body Rock making their way into commercials . That is because they are excellent . This is the only album of 1999 where the majority of songs are good . In a year with almost no good new music , Play is an incredible suprise .
 It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . It was all good . Oh Yeah , did i mention it was all good .
 4 * s the weirdest album you 'll ever hear . . one song fast beat make you wan na jump up the next a like slow run on ... which ar n't bad either . . if you like the brothers or Fat boy i recomend getting it
 A very interesting album for Moby -LRB- as always -RRB- . It was hard to expect where he 'd turn next , especially after the loud banging industrial of `` Animal Rights '' and once again Moby 's taken off in an exciting new direction with his new release , `` Play '' . With this album Moby does some incredible work tweaking old songs like `` Sometimes '' by Bessie Jones into mod , beat driven and sometimes techno-looped tracks like `` Honey '' . For those of you who 've heard that or the second single , `` Run On '' , and are craving for more , you 'll get just that with `` Find My Baby '' and `` Natural Blues '' -LRB- though those two releases are perhaps the best songs on the cd -RRB- . Another stand out track is Porcelain , also available on the `` Playing By Heart '' soundtrack , a wickedly smooth technoish song , both mellow and full of energy , this track is begging to be remixed . In fact , it struck me that this album would be perfect for a remix cd like the double disk remix version of `` Everything is Wrong '' . The album is ok , but not entirely coherent , much like `` I Like to Score '' it is a hodgepodge of sound , and the later tracks are occasionally a little weak . The three basic types of song are the always present orchestrated compositions -LRB- like the gorgeous `` Everloving '' -RRB- , the classic track remakes , and songs which feature Moby sometimes singing , other times speaking , with a lot of interesting harmonizing -LRB- kinda like a softer animal rights perhaps . One is even reminiscent of `` The Blue Light of the Underwater Sun '' -RRB- . `` Play '' is a must have for any Moby fan , and the insert has some great pictures of Moby playing in a hotel room and of course a collection of killer essays .
 First of all , I 've noticed in a lot of these reviews that you all think the song Honey goes `` gunna gunny gum bag '' or whatever . You must be deaf , the lyrics are obviously `` When my Honey comes back `` I loved this album , It never fails to make me smile.Honey - Great beat , fun to dance to , and sing to if you are n't deaf and can understand the lyrics ... Find My Baby - It was n't my favorite , but I definitely liked itPorcelain - One of the first Moby songs I ever heard , I was in love immediatelySouth Side - I loved this song , It 's my favorite one to sing to other than HoneyBodyRock - This one just made me want to stand up and dance immediatelyNatural Blues - Loved this song , love the beat to itRun On - My favorite one to sing to , after Honey and South SideThe other ones I liked , but I did n't find anything exceptional about them , but the songs I listed above made up for that ...
 I took a chance on buying this album after reading an article in a news magazine about the music scene . News magazine music reviews are usually hype about marginal albums and a waste of time , but this time was an exception . The album is great , and after listening to samples of his earlier albums , I would have to say that his music has definitely evolved for the better . I also sampled the later Moby albums here on Amazon , and I would have to say that `` Play '' is the best so far of the Moby albums , even better than `` Go , The Very Best of Moby '' . Go figure . The `` Go '' album should be retitled `` Moby , A Sampler '' , because that 's all it is . `` Play '' is the album that made Moby famous , and it is still the best .
 i got this cd the day it came out ... as soon as i got home i put it in ... i 'd heard about this cd moby was doing with alan lomax field recordings and did n't think it was that big a deal , but it still touched my soul ... this was before it got big off bodyrock and i thought it was beautiful ... i think the sales prove that people can have good taste after all . remember , just because it sells does n't mean it 's not good .
 For those who enjoy the electronica/club type music , Moby has put out an album we all can enjoy . All tracks are good-sounding , maybe not lyrically enlightening , but a good album to simply hear . Forget listening to it , but most music of this genre is n't really big on lyrics . Overall , a good purchase -- worth the purchase price
 Ok , i know the 90 's are over , but Moby surely concluded the decade with another phenomenal record . I 've got quite a collection of his , and formally his early underground album had been by favourite . but play has shown the more medolic side of moby 's voice . i 've been recommending this album to so many people , and i have to say , each person has grown to have a deep liking to moby and want to hear more from him . the man is intelligent , he loves his fans , and wants to shed some beautiful light on the sickening world we find ourselves in . and god , is n't porcelain just gorgeous ? the piano , the humming he does ... wow ...
 I 've only heard some of Moby 's work , but from what I have heard I love it . Every song is different , unlike the Back Street Boys or N'sync . Moby is a great artist and his music is becoming more and more popular -LRB- hey , I 've heard 2 of his songs on the X-files . -RRB- Play seems like a good album !
 I 'm not sure what these people who say it is boring -LRB- and insulting to women ? Where did THAT come from -RRB- are thinking ! It is truly a * deep * piece of work . The music evokes all sorts of feelings in me , primarily peace , happiness , and tranquility , but certainly not boredom ! Some songs are more `` peppy '' than others , some really could put you to sleep , but is that a Bad thing ? I do n't think so ! It 's not something to dance to at the club , but it 's definitely 5 stars or more !
 I am not a big Moby fan , but I was completely stunned and overcome with how incredible this album is . Every song is a testament to joy and it has no false notes . I ca n't stress enough that this is probably one of the great albums in the history of rock music , an absolutely essential recording . Please check it out .
 This album has proven accessible to nearly everyone I know -- I 've even used it to show my parents and in-laws -LRB- all in their 50s -RRB- why electronica is such a compelling genre of music.However , it 's not `` poppy '' or watered down electronica . Rather , by using blues and gospel influences , Moby has simply widened the scope of his music in a way that few eectronica artists previously have .
 I will admit that this is an awesome CD , but compared to earlier efforts such as `` Everything is Wrong '' -LRB- my personal favorite -RRB- , it 's not all that great . Some tracks even get boring at times , and `` Bodyrock '' is a little too mainstream and conformist for my tastes . I would still strongly recommend the CD , but get his other ones first .
 moby 's an artist you can never pin down . a chameleon of dance music . this latest turn has produced one of the most original albums this year . y' know what ? dunno ' why , but first time i heard it i was disapointed . then , a few days later i stuck it back on my cd player . something clicked . now , it 's hardly ever off it . stand out track for me * has * to be the excellent ` run on ' . this work is right up there with the motzart 's of dance music like orbital ...
 I first heard this in a bookstore . My goal was to go around and listen to all of the new music , but I kept pulling the headphones off so I could hear more of Moby Play . I play it non-stop now and am sending it to all my friends .
 I am like to listen to the whale man who is to sing whale song .
 This album was masterfully created . Not normally my type of music , but you ca n't not like it . He is a genius !!! The track Porcelein featured in `` Beach '' is beautiful . I want to know what some of the lyrics are actually saying other than traveling so far and in my mind im floating . Amazing . Moby is like the new Yanni . I think he has his own way of composing . In my oppinion this is one of his best albums . The sound is a little bit of pop and funk as well as some new age classical . Keep it up Moby !!!
 As a new & improved Moby fan I will be glad to contemplate on my thoughts of this middle 1999 release . This touching , beautifully carved masterpiece is a disc that is n't to be forgotten in all the years you are to be buying CDs . There are many highlights of this album but some melodies that deserve an A + from me are `` Inside , '' the relaxing instrumental , and `` Porcelain , '' the well-crafted , popular song . Many of these songs highlight this disc but a few run off track -LRB- `` 7 '' -RRB- and that 's about it ! This is one of the best albums I own -- and it will be getting a lot of attention from my CD player.Gains an A from me ... 1 -RRB- Honey -- A quality song that opens well but the undistinctive lyrics of this `` sample '' make it a little less worthy listening . Grade
 this is a good lp , yet , sadly enough , it does have the basic outline of lots of other songs .
 I buy lots and lots of CD 's all year long . To be quite frank , most are a disappointment , a few good tracks -LRB- if we 're lucky -RRB- and the remainder is filler . NOT THIS ONE ! This could be my all-time favorite CD of the year . Get over to your listening stations and you 'll hear what I mean . One listen and you ca n't stop . BRAVO MOBY ! To everyone else , ENJOY .
 This is truly the best one of my collection!I 'm not bragging at all!Moby put many different elements in this album , and every track of this cd is annoyingly fascinating!Moby I Love ya !
 Moby has always been a man to push the envelope wide open , and surprisingly the music industry for once caught a genious in action . This is the first Moby disc that has recieved world-wide fame , but it IS for good reason . This is a classic both in dance and good old rock-and-roll . It 's Moby at his finest.So good , in fact , that many like myself are forced to purchase the `` B-Sides '' album and some of the man 's earlier stuff , starting probably with `` Mobysongs '' the greatest hits released right before he made the extrication of `` Play . '' Sheer genious in every respect , with a handful of singles , a growing fanbase , and praise from critics , Moby is now right where he belongs ; on the forefront of rock-and-roll . Enjoy his masterpiece ...
 There is little that can be added to what has already been said about this cd . I had never bought anything from Moby in my 200 plus CD collection . However , I loved the remix of Southside with Gwen Stefani and heard that a lot of his songs are played in TV commercials . So , I took a chance and bought this CD , and I 'm glad that I did . With the exception of Dizzy Up the Girl by the Goo Goo Dolls and Enema of the State by Blink 182 , I ca n't think of another CD that I have that I can listen to almost every track . As stated by others , this CD contains a little bit of everything with techno , gospel , blues , hip-hop , rap , pop , and new age . Unlike today 's bubble-gum pop that is so formulaic and every song sounds the same , i.e. -LRB- Max Martin , Denniz POP , etc. -RRB- , you definitely ca n't say this about Moby 's Play . Every track is good , but the standouts in my mind are Honey , Porcelain , Why Does my . . , Southside , Bodyrock , Everloving , and My Weakness . I was pleasantly surprised to find that this CD had been re-issued with the Gwen Stefani version . This saved me from wasting $ 6 on the CD single . If you are interested in lyrics and meaningful songs , Moby probably wo n't suit you . However , if you just like good music , then this CD is for you . It is an unbelievable experience . I definitely plan on getting more Moby .
 WOW . Every song on this CD is just so cool ! Dance , Techno , Trance , it 's got it all ! Song # 18 , is just soul-soothing ! I first heard it on the ep ` Closure'of the show ` The X-Files ' and it brought tears to my eyes . My husband , who normally does n't like soothing music said that it was beautiful ~ A definate buy for yound and old alike !
 This is the best CD i own . I like every track from it . `` Honey '' - great beat , very creative . `` Find My Baby '' - the vocal is a litle annoying , but the song is still very good and funky . `` Porcelain '' - very beautiful , Moby 's voice is soothing and so is the additional voice sample . `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad ? '' - great song , very beautiful , nice voice samples . `` South Side '' - very , very funky . Great song . `` Bodyrock '' - great , funky song , with rap samples . `` Natural Blues '' - beautiful song , great voice samples . `` Machete '' - hard and smooth at the same time . `` 7 '' - odd , original , cool . `` Run On '' - catchy , good lyrics . `` Down Slow '' - very relaxing and great . `` Rushing '' - great song . `` If Things Were Perfect '' - great voice samples , mesmorising . `` Everloving '' - well-written and performed with talent . `` Inside '' - smooth and cool . `` Guitar Flute & String '' - soothing and cool . `` The Sky Is Broken '' - beautifully written and soothingly performed . `` My Weakness '' - spiritual and soothing . Awesome album .
 I did n't know much about Moby or techno until I happened to catch `` Better Living Through Circuitry '' on cable . Mobysongs , a greatest hits collection , was the first CD I bought . Play is the second . Play is definitely more diverse than Mobysongs . I enjoyed the gospel and blues influences in Play . I seems like Moby is trying to bring something organic to the techno sound . The synthesis is interesting and enjoyable .
 This album shows that `` mixed '' music is n't just boring and endless beats . Moby has the same qualities that Fatboy Slim and Chemical Brothers have , but moby rips the beats out in a wide arange of styles . This album does not get boring because of the different styles Moby comes up with . Some tracks are easily reconisabale like `` Porcelin , '' but some become your favorite songs like the great guitar track `` Everloving . '' Moby has made a very unique album which should be loved instantly .
 This is one of the most extrodiary albums I 've heard in ... ever . I 'm not even a tehno fan , I like southern rock . I wake up to this CD every morning , and listen to it all the way through at least once a day . The music is equally good to listen too while working , playing or doing anything ... else ;-RRB- . All I can say is buy it , and buy it NOW .
 Forget all the -LSB- garbage -RSB- you 've heard about Moby , his newest CD `` Play '' is one of the best mixes of soul , techno , and rock that I 've heard in a long time . The way he uses all different genres of music is incredible . I would have to say the two best songs on this CD are Natural Blues and Run On . If you do n't have this CD by now
 This effort by activist Moby is a smooth melange of up-tempo , funkified , and clubmix rhythms along with soulful , ethereal harmonies punctuated with percussion and synthesizers . Whereas other artists may have relied too heavily upon the sampled material , Moby has successfully managed to turn the snippet of melody into a new `` found '' artwork/song , as one will hear in the twangy backbeat of `` Honey '' and the techno-esque `` Bodyrock '' . Kudos to this ambitious young man .
 There is a type of music that , once you start listening to it , you simply feel the need to dance . You feel that the music was made to be danced to , that you were made to just lose yourself and go with the rhythm . It may sound corny , but for the millions of people who just ca n't help the need to dance , that is Moby.My friend once made the comment , listening to Moby , that `` this music is almost too cool for me ... I feel wrong listening to it in public '' . And indeed you should . Moby is not made to be listened to on a boom box at a family picnic or driving down the street in your Chevy Suburban -LRB- although both are fine -RRB- . Moby is not music that you listen to for the quality of the lyrics -LRB- with the exception perhaps being `` Porcelian '' , # 3 on Play ; my favorite song on the album -RRB- . Whether by yourself or , preferably , a group of people , Moby is made to move your body to . With it 's not-too-techno-y sound , mellow vocals -LRB- although most of the vocals are not done by Moby , but are taken from random songs and put to music -RRB- , and rhythmic percussion -LRB- whether it 's synthisized or real -RRB- , Moby 's music , along with The Chemical Brothers ' , stands atop the music world as the supreme achievement in unconventional , highly musical , non-commercialized house-music . This music will never make an appearance on `` TRL '' , never top the Billboard Pop Charts , or any charts for that matter , rather , it will stay in the dance halls , fraternities , clubs , and homes of those who , like myself , are unable not to dance .
 Moby 's newest album has a rich , yet dry quality , compared to his previous albums . His track , `` Natural Blues '' , had a nice earthytone , but was somewhat long , and drawnout . However , the track , `` Porcelain '' , was worth waiting for ; it had a three-dimensional harmony that pulls you in . The different elements blend together nicely .
 Just a short note to ' a music fan of middle america ' . I brought this album in May 99 , which means I know it has been around for well over a year now . During that time , not a week has gone by where I have not listened to it at least a couple of times . It is a breathtaking album , magnificent and downright funky in equal measures . Just listen to My Weakness ! Just listen to it!It rose slowly throught the charts , bouyed up by word of mouth recommendations . It then got to the top here in the UK and has stayed there for the past four weeks or so . If you call that a passing fad , well ... I 'm not quite sure what you know what you mean . How , then , would you define all those artists who release a couple of singles that go to the top for a week and immediatley fade into obscurity ? a ` passing very very very very quickly fad ' , perhaps ?
 On Moby 's '99 album `` Play '' , Moby uses soul and folk music to give his rhythm a little personality . The pianos and keyboards have a classical feel where the rhythm brings in a techno style and the vocals make you want to celebrate . I believe Play is the best album of ' 99 . The album covers many levels and must be heard completely to uncover th whole package . You do n't even have to like dance to enjoy this record . Top cuts include `` Honey '' , `` Machete '' , and `` Everloving '' . Play is a definant classic .
 Moby creates a sensual audio masterpiece with this album . The tracks herein are both groov-alicious -LRB- `` Honey '' -RRB- to thoroughly meditative -LRB- `` Guitar , Flute , and String '' -RRB- , so there 's a little bit of everything for anytime . With Play Moby proves that you can use synth and turntables to express desire , sorrow , and hope.This album is constantly being listed in the top 20 or 25 albums of the 1990s ; there 's a good reason for this , and it came out at the very end of the decade . I see it as a nice musical closure to the 90s , so do n't miss it !
 This cd just gets you . I could listen to this cd so much it is crazy . My test of a good cd is if I could sit in a car , go on a road trip , and listen to it all the way through , without getting sick of it . This passes the test . I cant say a bad song on here . My personal faves are Honey , Porcelain , Bodyrock , and Natural Blues . Just buy this cd and listen to it , cause you get the best price here anyway .
 This is a must-have album . I bought this album for one song , and that song is `` Natural Blues '' . I never really paid attention to the other tracks until I listened to it in a CD player that ca n't fast-forward through tracks , and let me tell you , this is AWESOME . I ended up liking most of the tracks . I 'm a fan of R&B , Pop , and Rock , and this album has all of those , not to include some of the sweet sounds of ambient music -LRB- that i 've just discovered with this album -RRB- . Stand-out tracks
 I think Moby is one of the few people whose remixes I appreciate , but Play brings out a whole new side of this talented individual . Play will appeal to a broad audience , especially people who love trip-hop , dance , and/or electronica . Porcelain and South Side are my favorites .
 I 'm not typically a fan of this kind of music but I love this album and would recommend it to virtually anyone - no matter what your taste ... buy it , you 'll like it .
 This CD is my weakness ... it 's one of the few I listen to a lot without getting sick of it . I bought this CD a few months ago after hearing `` Porcelain '' on the trailer for THE BEACH . I almost bought the soundtrack to the movie , but decided to check out the album to see which one I 'd like better . After hearing part of `` My Weakness '' on Amazon -LRB- and beating myself up trying to think where I 'd heard it before -RRB- I realized it had been featured on THE X-FILES . I 'm 100 % satisfied that I bought this instead of THE BEACH . -LRB- `` The Sky Is Broken '' was also on an episode of X-FILES . -RRB- I can never decide which song is my favorite . Sometimes I go for the great chorus of `` South Side '' and other times I go for the techno sound of `` Machete . '' Other times I like the funkiness of `` Run On . '' While those are three of my favorites on the album , I think the best ones are the two I bought it for , `` Porcelain '' and `` My Weakness . '' I find it funny that `` Porcelain '' is just now receiving popularity on radio , when I discovered it long ago . -LRB- I had actually heard and liked it before THE BEACH but never knew what it was until then . -RRB- I 'd also heard `` Bodyrock '' but I like it a lot better on the CD than I did hearing it elsewhere . A good friend of mine criticized my decision to buy the CD when I told her I wanted it , and now she is completely obsessed with `` Porcelain '' and wants to buy the CD . There is a lot of variety on this CD , but all of it is distinctly Moby . I heard the opening song in GONE IN 60 SECONDS and immediately knew it was him since it sounded similar to `` Run On '' and `` Honey . '' Anybody who likes any of Moby 's singles is bound to find a few songs they love on this CD . Also , those who enjoy variety with a mix of thoughtful , reflective songs and up-tempo ones should buy this .
 There are many reasons why this cd is a great one , First , it has a great beat to it , Second , it has been featured on the x-files a few times and Moby is just a very great group , better than all that Britney Spears and Backstreet boys crud that everyone my age listens to .
 I am not a big Moby fan , but I was completely stunned and overcome with how incredible this album is . Every song is a testament to joy and it has no false notes . I ca n't stress enough that this is probably one of the great albums in the history of rock music , an absolutely essential recording . Please check it out .
 This CD is the only thing getting me through an extremely stressful time in my life . You are absorbed into the music and everything else seems to fade away , if only for a moment . Thank you Moby for helping me to heal .
 I 'd give it all the stars in the sky if I could . When I listened to this CD , I was taken to another world . It 's deeply moving . I felt as if I were floating in the air , an out of body experience . Music is my drug , I need it all the time and when I do n't have it playing , I play it in my mind . Moby has embodied my spirit and for that I 'm enternally greatful .
 i did n't know MOBY and hear a song in a bar `` honey '' it was so fun , i was shop this cd and i listened and the others songs . it 's perfect ! i love MOBY
 Moby is pretty cool and I think teh best song on Play is Bodyrock . I also like Honey and 7 . I rated it 4 out of 5 because there are some bad songs , but I recomend listening to it and buying it .
 I had n't heard of Moby until recently , and I must say , this is excellent work here . I really enjoy the more serious , if not depressing side of this brave artist . The cut titled `` Why does my heart feel so bad '' is a beautiful and forgiving tune . It 's this darker more serious side of Moby , that has caught me . `` My Weakness '' is another that tells us something more is under the surface of this man.You will hear and feel a different world through him . No wonder it 's a Grammy nominee ! I highly recommmend you buy this right away if not sooner . Sit back and listen to Moby 's world as it comes to you .
 This was the first cd album that I ever bought from Moby . I think this was the best album of 1999 . My favorite songs are `` my weakness '' and `` the sky is broken . '' When listening , it 's like you can feel all your emotions at once . It 's incredible . That 's the mark of a good song and of an album .
 I can not get this CD out of my player ! Soulful , danceable , and often rocks as well . A complete listening experience . This is definitely the one album to own from the past year .
 Though Moby has been releasing albums over the years , it wasnt until this record that he got himself the attention that was long overdue . Possibly bcos he was double nominated at the Grammys this year and the inclusion of Porcelain and Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad on The Beach & The Next Best Thing soundtracks . These tracks aside , the album is an excellent collection of pop , trip-hop , rock , dance & electronic tunes . All these fused very nicely on the 18 tracks which no one has done so well and without a loss in direction . In the Cd sleeve , you find essays by Moby on his personal life , beliefs , the decisions he made and the paths he has chosen . As intellectual , mind-boggling and refreshing as his impeccable music . One of the best albums in a while .
 Excellent album . Moby draws from every musical genre and creates a greatly unique and thoughtful sound . His music is deep and filled with emotion . Musically challeging , Moby constructs multi-layered standards that should become classics .
 This is a very good cd you should buy it ! My favourite songs are Why does my heart feel so bad , Porcelain , guitar flute and stings and 7 although almost all songs on the album are good !
 I first heard Moby on an ad for MTV . It was a strange ad . It started off with a cross-country team running in the heat and then a bunch of kids laughing at them . Then `` BodyRock '' came on and they showed scenes of teenager 's lives . The end said , `` The Rhythem of Being Young . '' It showed teenagers lives so well . Then when the music hits its climax the commercial game me chills . I asked a friend who this was and she said Moby . I knew that I had to get this album . . using our good friend Napster , we retrieved it quickly . EVERY SONG GAVE ME CHILLS . `` porcelain '' `` Rushing '' `` BodyRock '' `` My Weakness '' are awesome . I can listen to them and if i am doin anything i have to stop because they make me think about life so much . The way that Moby has added blues , techno , and the gospel lyrics is a great combination . `` My Weakness '' has a background of children and then the instrumental part is so powerful . I have never listened to previous Moby , but I love this and recommend it to any person who likes music that makes them think about life .
 Everyone should own this cd ! I would give it more stars but five is all I 'm allowed ! It has music for every mood
 Must listen to it no matter which stile you follow . His best so far
 I was pleasantly surprised with Moby 's CD . I bought it for the songs Natural blues , Porcelain and Body Rock . I was expecting the songs to be really dance orientated and I was surprised to find that many were n't . There were a lot of soothing instrumental songs . The CD has a lot heart and soul . I especially like Why does my heart feel so bad ? Overall , there is a good mix of techno and soul . Play is definately one of my favorite CDs and I highly recomend it .
 Being familiar with Moby 's earlier work , I was shocked , surprised , and very pleased with this CD . It is n't often that an artist can re-invent their sound so radically . Rather than the techno sound we 're used to , this one has a blues-y , melodic feel . Plus , every song has a different sound rather than the repetitive drivel produced by some musicians . This one pretty much stays in my truck 's CD changer.Love it !
 I did n't think I would like this cd before I bought it . I am not a big techno fan . But the reviews for this cd were so highly in praise of it , I thought I would give it a chance.It is amazing . My favorite songs are Porcelain and Why does my heart feel so bad ? But , I do n't think there are really any bad songs on here . -LRB- I personally do n't like BodyRock , but that does n't make it a bad song . -RRB- After listening to this cd , I definitely want to look for more work by Moby .
 A lot of strong musical background can be found in this CD but if you want something with more lyrics I would n't recommend this to you . I do enjoy listening to this CD though because the lyrics are strong and the music behind them is different for every song . The CD offers a variety of styles and all are perfected by Moby .
 Okay I love this cd ! I even like the first 2 tracks . In fact , `` Find my baby '' is one of my favorites . This album is so eclectic . There are so many different types of music on this one cd that there is something for everyone . This is a must have in my opinion !
 `` Play '' is the techno album that proved a Mac could have a soul . Moby took ancient blues and gospel voices and layered them with dance grooves , creating songs such as `` Porcelain '' and `` Natural Blues , '' which have a strange , haunting beauty that also became background music in countless TV commercials .
 I will admit when I first bought this album , I did not like it . In fact , I hated it and would have attempted to sell it immediately , but I 'd only paid five bucks or so for it in the first place so I kept it , figuring I would n't get much of a return . Two weeks passed with me glaring at what seemed to be wasted money in my cd rack before I finally decided to give Moby 's `` Play '' another listen . Boy , am I glad I did.This cd is something strange and intriguing with tracks that are pure ear candy and I enjoyed every minute of it . It 's easy to fall into the `` skip-a-song '' trap with an album you 've heard many times before , but no matter how often I listen to `` Play '' I never seem to get tired of it . My favorite songs are `` South Side '' and `` Porcelain '' but every track is pretty good . I 'm not really a techno/dance fan but this album truly made me more open to hearing similar artists.Just goes to show that everything deserves a second chance. :] -RSB-
 I 'm giving this album 4 stars not because it has `` killer '' songs-though it does have good ones-but for the fact that it is very easy on the ear . Moby has a very mellow , rhythmic , black sounding album here . I do n't really have the vocabulary to describe his musical influences ... maybe you could list them as blues , soul and perhaps gospel . Some of his songs sound sort of school-girly ... like maybe the kind of stuff you 'd hear black girls skipping along to in America.Moby melds these African American musical influences with elements of hip-hop and dance music . He also seems to sample material from the source-black men and women . I really ca n't say whether Moby is doing the originals justice but I can say that I like what he 's done with the source material . This is another way of saying that if you are familiar with the source material you may find Moby 's treatment annoying . Personally , sometimes I feel the same way about people messing with the originals . One case which changed my mind was Muddy Waters ' own revisiting of his blues songs , but with a harder , rock sound -LSB- I 've reviewed Waters ' `` Hard again '' here . Found it superior to his more `` classic '' approach , as in `` Anthology '' -RSB- . Anyway , some of my favourite tracks on the album are
 I had never heard of this person before until a friend of mine came for a visit from California and popped this in . I had to have my own copy of it . The song , track 3 , `` porcelain '' is completely spell binding . I live on and island and this gets my vote for some of the best beach music yet played on my boardwalk . I honestly do n't even know how to describe this stuff expect to say that you 're gon na love it . Haunting .
 I 'd heard various Moby songs before , but it was n't until I heard his album `` Play '' that I became a well and truly devoted Moby fan . His music is inspiring , intelligent , thought provoking , and revolutionary . It could almost be classified as art . Bodyrock , Porcelain , South Side and Everloving are my favourites , but the other tracks are also excellent . I would definately recommend this cd to anyone .
 I 've been listening to Moby for years now , and enjoy this CD as much as his past CD 's -LRB- minus a couple `` rabit trails '' he took -RRB- . Bringing in all new sounds to a dance beat really makes this CD sound creative and complex yet still catchy and `` pop-like '' . Obviously Moby is maturing into a great writer , and by taking on new instruments and sounds , I am eager to see his future in the music industry . Pop-rock-electronica-club and orchestral/soundtrack .
 I bought this CD for the song `` My Weakness '' which I first heard in an episode of the X-Files . After listening to `` My Weakness '' a few times I listened to the rest of the CD . I loved just about every song . My favorites are `` Porcelain '' , `` South Side '' , `` Natural Blues '' , `` Run On '' and of course `` My Weakness '' . Moby 's music is different from most music I hear but it is definately better . The song `` The Sky Is broken '' is poetry set to music . I liked `` Run On '' for setting old singing to newer music . This one of my favorite CD 's .
 Play is a real treat for Moby fans or anyone who just likes good music . Each song on the album has its own feel to it and is beautiful in its own way . The highlights
 Super-talented Moby writes , engineers , mixes , produces and plays all the instruments on `` Play '' , which is quite worthy of all the recognition and praise it has received . He samples memorable phrases from old vinyl blues records and seamlessly lines them with catchy beats -LRB- `` Honey '' , `` Find My Baby '' , `` Run On '' -RRB- . He expresses his love for soul ballads with use of gospel singers -LRB- `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad ? '' -RRB- and samples -LRB- `` Natural Blues '' -RRB- over piano and cinematic synthesized strings . Several instrumental tracks are present along with a few disco tunes . This is an essential record because Moby takes pop or whatever you want to call it to another level .
 I hate to admit this , but this is the first Moby album I have heard and I have not been able to stop listening to it . There are particular songs that I think are stronger but the album as a whole is incredible . Each song stands on its own yet coalesces with the one before and after it smoothly . The transitions between songs are great . Basically it works . It is difficult to get a hold of an album these days that you can listen to straight through without skipping through songs . You can with Play . Moby 's talent shines and his genius for sound is apparent . I have now become a dedicated Moby fan , but I ca n't seem to stop listening to Play long enough to check out the other albums .
 I have always found Moby to be less than excellent . Occasionally I would hear a track of his that was worthwhile , but overall I was unimpressed until `` Play . '' Ironically , I was indifferent to the first single `` Bodyrock '' which I thought was boring . I still skip it more often than not . `` Machete '' is sorta tired as well . -LRB- Oddly enough , these are the only two tracks a fellow listener liked . Apparently , he and I stand on opposite sides of the spectrum . -RRB- As for the rest of the CD , I think it 's really beautiful . The idea of sampling blues and gospel seems hackneyed originally but I find it to be very moving . `` Find my baby '' is extremely cool . `` Why does my heart ... '' might make you misty . `` Natural blues '' is incredible as well . Each song is pretty damn good . It 'll grow on you .
 Let 's be real
 I have to say that i hadnt really been a big fan of Moby until , an advert couldnt go by without it featuring one of Moby 's songs , so i decided to buy Play . Im glad i did as its one of the best albums this year and i can understand why it is the second best selling album in the UK this year -LRB- beaten only by the Beatles -RRB- . Featuring hits such as Honey , Porcelain , Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad , Body Rock -LRB- my favourite -RRB- , Natural Blues and Run On . Even with all of these songs relesed as singles there are still plenty more on the album and im sure that you have heard one on an advert and probably liked it .
 Believe the hype . This CD is incredible . Moby meshes to extremes in music and the outcome is just so damn cool . He samples old basic work/gospel songs from Alan Lomax 's field recordings and incorporates them into this new whole electronica thing . This album is genius . He takes the most basic form of music and puts it with the most complicated . The idea seems so simple but has never been thought of before .
 When you say the word `` techno '' , people tend to imagine loud , obnoxious electronic dance songs with loads of annoying sound-effects . Rest assured that if that 's your defintion of techno , this ai n't techno.Moby takes 18 tracks and tackles multiple genres
 Moby has outdone himself on `` Play . '' If ever God was channeling himself through a musician , Moby is his main disciple . This CD is so deep , so rich , so clearly coming from some higher place , yet , as always , so danceable , so totally in front of everybody else.As a former New Yorker now living in Alabama , I used to play Moby 's `` Everything is Wrong '' on the Walkman when I went running in the park around the reservoir . Early morning , mist rising off the water , ducks ambling along , there is no better soul experience . Between the heart-soaring orchestral God-music on one side of the CD , and the thrash beat on the other , my endorphins would practically burst out of my body . I did n't think Moby could get any better , but `` Play '' is the best thing he 's ever done.Alabama 's a mixed experience with all its negative racial history , but gospel music here is just unbelievable . In `` Play '' Moby has totally captured the heart and pain and longing of where gospel is coming from . He 's the best .
 `` Play '' is the first electronic album I have listened to that has a visceral , beating bloody heart at it 's center . Moby has engineered an elegant and wrenching disc that will justly be remembered as one of the most important electronic releases ever . Tracks like `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad ? '' and `` Natural Blues '' will probably get some listeners teary-eyed ; while others like the exquisite `` Bodyrock '' and the gospel-tinged rhapsody `` Run On '' will build them up again . Other stellar songs include
 I had followed Moby , once I heard some of his material in the `` Cool World '' soundtrack back in 1992 . I bought some of his albums , and thought `` Everthing Is Wrong '' was somewhat over-rated . However , `` Play '' is the album that not only put Moby on the map ... it also showcases his ability to take samples and work music around them masterfully . The feeling of `` Play '' is one of awe and enjoyment . The electronic music set to samples of soul singers is truely a refreshing sound . I also like that Moby contributes with his own vocals , and that he adds a few instrumentals to the mix . A well rounded album , that should be on the list for the top ten albums of the 90 's . I like `` 18 '' just as much , but be warned that `` Play '' is a bit more upbeat and fun ... where as `` 18 '' is more moody and introspective .
 One moment Moby seems to distill the wisdom of the ages , the next moment the music exists for the sheer joy of being . Elegantly balanced , superbly crafted . Want a soundtrack for your life ? You could do no better than this work .
 This album is so eclectic . The variety of sounds , styles and moods is great . You will never get tired of it . It 's one of those that will stay at the top of your collection . Try Morcheeba and Hooverphonic . They are similar and are in some cases even better than Moby .
 This album made my spirit soar . In `` My Weakness '' , I felt as though Moby transported me to a different world ; it was reminiscent of the tune in Close Encounters . `` Porcelain '' , `` Why does my heart feel so bad ? '' & , `` Natural Blues '' among others moved me the moment I first heard them . With `` Why does my heart . . '' I felt as though it cleansed me , like I was lifted to a higher place . I could just feel the warmth of the sun as I played it . Play seems as though its main purpose is to contribute to people 's lives ; to enrich them and somehow lift them out of whatever repetitive days we go through , time after time . Putting mini-essays in was unique , enjoyable , and informative , and I found myself agreeing with each one of them . Back to the songs ; `` Honey '' put a smile on my face and made my foot tap ; it genuinely made me feel happy . Play contains such diverse , varied , and unique songs , which , in one way or another -LRB- happy & optimistic , or sad and pensive -RRB- help enrich your life . It is true , I kid you not . I found a quote regarding Ludwig van Beethoven , and I find it appropriate for Moby
 Moby is a genius . In 1999 , he did something no one else had ever done
 I 'll be honest . I originally only bought this album for Bodyrock . When I put this disc in my player , I was blown away ! The entire album can only be described as brilliant.Please do n't let the idea of a mix of blues and electronica turn you off . This album is simply amazing .
 I consider myself a person of eclectic tastes , but had for years been unable to get much into electronic music , mostly because it seemed so inorganic and mechanical . I listened hard , tried what my friends reccomended to me as so-called `` pop '' techno , such as Prodigy or the Chemical Brothers , but said pop techno seemed to have nothing to say and no original way to say it . So I gave up on the idea for a good long time . Then , last year , I ran into a couple of old albums by the Orb , and I began to see potential in this music
 play is quite simply the most fascinating record i have heard to date . the fact that moby spins blues and folk records into techno isnt the marvel here , its how good it sounds when he does that should be taken notice of . the variety is another thing that should be noted since despite the fact that the running theme throughout the album is remixed folk and blues there arent any two songs on the album which really sound like one another . i had the pleasure of watching moby do an instore to promote this album , and i was amazed at the energy and talent to play to a crowd onstage . for those of you wondering , moby can reproduce this sound onstage -LRB- he plays every instrument -RRB- without turntables ! after his set , i got to meet him and i told him that he was `` nothing less than a phenomenon '' he smiled shook my hand and humbly told me he was very flattered . take heed to this gentleman , hes got more funk and soul than that obese skinny character we cant get off the radio ...
 Moby 's `` Play '' is an hour of raw , honest emotion.This 1999 album may have been a big pop hit due the fact that Moby liscened all the songs to commericals and films , excessive media coverage , and of course , his duet with Gwen Stefani , `` South Side '' BUT over all that is a very spritual and emotional album that you would n't except from such a frumpy looking guy -LRB- lol -RRB- . Many of the tracks use samples from archival blues and gospel records under hypnotic dance tracks suppiled by Moby himselfand it just plain moves you ! This is the type of album that you can just play and sit down and listen to beginning and end and you 'll feel like you 've went on a journey of some sort.Really . `` Honey '' , the soaring `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad '' -LRB- one of the most beautiful songs I 've heard in recent memory -RRB- , `` Porcelian '' , `` Machete '' , the ubiqtious `` Bodyrock '' ... you name it , every emotion is displaced in the songs.I 've never heard a mainstream -LRB- well , the mainstream came to it -RRB- album with such crystal clear emotion.Wheter you want to grieve over something or clean your house , Moby 's `` Play '' is the album for you.Let me just close by saying that there 's a song on here for every ocassion ... And how can I forget about `` Natrual Blues '' . Oh , man ... That song is so beautiful ! The video with Christina Ricci -LRB- directed by zany photographer David LaChapelle -RRB- is so touching and Moby 's sweeping performance of the song along with Jill Scott and avant garde performance act Blue Man Group was equally moving ... Oh , sorry for adding all that but I just had to include that .
 This is my first Moby purchase , and I was totally blown away by this CD . There is a certain grace and beauty about `` Play '' that I would not have thought possible in the `` techno '' genre until I listened to this . It 's hard to list the highlights because every song is a highlight in itself . `` Find my baby '' , `` Why does my heart feel so bad ? '' , `` Natural blues '' , and especially `` Run on '' are masterful examples of taking sampled `` field recordings '' , with all the passion of the -LRB- fairly unknown -RRB- original artists and weaving them into a beautiful tapestry of modern music . The finale , `` My weakness '' is absolutely stunning . I did n't want it to end!I have been very disgruntled with the general direction of popular music the last couple of years , with the likes of Korn , Limp Biskit , Kid Rock , and Eminem dominating popular taste . But an album like `` Play '' gives me hope for the future of music .
 The Godfather of Modern American Electronic Dance Music , Moby has never shied away for pushing the envelope . When the rave scene became a `` scene '' , he drifted back to his hard rock roots -LRB- with varying success -RRB- . As what many call a return , he releases this dance-y gem with heavy deep delta blues influences . Mixing gospel and blues samples with sheened beats and loops and dropping in the occassional organ and guitar , he has dropped one of the most novel and likable albums of the decade . Some may have disdain for its accessibility and catchiness , but its appeal and creativity are undeniable .
 With Play , Moby combines his creativity with a generous heaping of musical savvy to create his most success offering yet . And what a soulful , joyful album he 's shared with us.From start to finish , Play is an aural delight . The highlights may be `` Honey , '' `` Porcelain , '' `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad , '' `` Natural Blues , '' and `` Run On , '' but nearly all the remaining songs hit the spot , too.The first half of the album consists largely of lovely , hymn-like songs -LRB- with the exception of the dancefloor-ready `` Bodyrock -RRB- , while Moby gets to explore his ambient roots more on the second half . This way he smartly snags the more commercial listeners with his hooky opening material , so that maybe they 'll stay along for the rest of the ride and a for bit of an education.As you 've probably already read , on many of the songs , Moby threads samples from old blues songs -LRB- specifically the Alan Lomax field recordings from `` Sounds of the South '' -RRB- into his own electronic compositions . In the hands of a lesser composer -LRB- and `` composer '' is a title that fits Moby better than many of his contemporaries -RRB- , this device could easily come off as stilted and gimmicky . Instead , Moby makes these musically anachronistic styles flow seamlessly , and the results are both organic and infectious . It 's not that others have n't done this sort of thing before ; they just have n't done it this well.Moby is definitely a musician who follows his own path , and as he finds his way , he 's finally getting the attention and praise he deserves . Play is one of the finest releases of 1999 .
 I have two complaints to do on this album . First , I find it too long -LRB- 18 songs total , that 's a lot -RRB- . Second , on `` Everloving '' song , for 3 seconds in the begining the sound comes only from one ear -LRB- very disturbing for me -RRB- . Moby is brilliant at mixing things together . My favorite songs in order are `` Natural blues '' , `` Everloving '' , `` Why does my heart feel so bad ? '' , `` If things were perfect '' , `` South side '' , `` Body rock '' , `` Honey and `` Machete '' . Sorry but I am tired to hear porcelain . There rest is fine except for `` Rushing '' and `` Down slow '' which I do n't like.Too bad my favorite song `` That is when I reach for my revolver '' is not on this album .
 A friend of a friend got me listening to Moby and I really enjoy `` Porcelain '' , `` Why does my heart feel so bad ? '' and `` Honey '' to name a few . I am just getting into his music but I think Moby is definitely worth some attention , this is my first `` electronic/techno '' whatever-you-may-call-it CD and I am liking it !
 I bought Mody 's CD without not really know what kind of songs are on it . I just saw his music video on tv . Well this is the best CD i bougth since Fiona Apple 's new one . The only thing it ran out of steam trowads the end . But finshed it was a great song . I think you should buy or use some eles ' CD or Tape . So you can listen to Moby .
 I found this product in very good condition and will buy from Amazon again .
 Might be my favorite album of all time ... so much so that I went out to hunt for the original pressing that had Southside w/o Gwen . Finally got it . The album is amazing .
 Play is , and was from the start , a classic . I think the tracks overall are great and arranged professionally , but also each track can be listened to individually and you will still get the same feeling ! 1 . Honey - This is a top song with a catchy beat , and I seem to be able to listen to it over and over again . -LRB- This song gets even better with the 118 Remix on the single -RRB- 2 . Find My Baby - I never used to like this song , but now I think its great . My first impressions were repetetive and boring , but if you can listen carefully and appreciate the song , it will become a favourite ! 3 . Porcelain - My favourite song off the album ! Beautifully arranged , and its a gorgeous song ! If you 've heard music from the album `` Animal Rights '' or `` Everything Is Wrong '' then its not what you 'd expect from Moby , but a great track .4 . Why Does My Heart - Brilliant :-RRB- The simple piano pattern , blues vocals and minor melody make it a song that you can listen to anytime , when your peaceful , upset , and even when your just relaxing .5 . South Side - It 's a good song , but I think Gwen Stefani singing along takes away from the originality .6 . Rushing - Not great but it fits in with the atmosphere of the album .7 . Bodyrock - Now this is a good song . Not Moby at all , but damn its catchy : -RRB- 8 . Natural Blues - This song means alot to people who can appreciate good blues music . Me = -RSB- 9 . Machete - Nice basic techno-ish beat .10 . 7 - Skip it , you would n't notice . Although I used to have this on cassette and it was the first track on Side B , which made a good intro .11 . Run On - I would n't have a clue what that guy is saying , and I 'm too lazy to look up lyrics but its a good song . I do n't know why they released an extended version , i Think its long enough .12 . Down Slow - Skip this one too . Or fast forward it on tape = P13 . If things were perfect - Yeaah its okay ... 14 . Everloving - My second favourite song on this album !!! It 's done so well , and it starts nice and acoustic and builds up to what soudns to be a full symphony orchestra or somethin like that .15 . Inside - Not a big fan but its near the end of the CD , where its winding down .16 - G , F & S - Wow this is surprisingly a good song . I never used to like it but I do now .17 - Sky Is Broken - Sort of haunting in a way , but still .18 - I do n't really like this track , but its the perfect album closer . Also , if youve seen the new live hotel tour dvd , its the opening sequence , which is a good start to a great concert.Well theirs my extra long review.Hope you read it all and didnt skip the boring bits like I do on this CD . : PBye
 I do n't like music that makes me think . Nor do I find it acceptable that a song should show some talent in terms of musicianship . When the singer 's voice is somewhat tuneful or interesting , it really puts me off . I ca n't really deal with anything outside of a 4/4 time , it does something to my bowels . Other techno music is so distracting with all of it 's interesting beats and innovative ideas . Give me simple amateur block chords mixed with a wash of drippy synth-strings . Then , throw in some a really limited use of easy samples . If the resulting music is just dull enough to use as background music in a commercial to sell socks , I 'm in lazy DJ heaven .
 I was n't aware of this creative artist , Moby.Till I heard his new radio song , South Side.I love this CD.I just got it yesterday and It 's amazing , a truimph for Moby.I hope in the future that this artist receives awards for his album.Moby had created the best album I own.This CD is a mix of techno/pop combination too create one of Moby 's greatest album.I hope that after the success of Play that he will right away start on the follow up.Every since I saw his performance on TV I knew I would love his music.It 's not just another album but the album of the year.If you were a fan of BodyRock , or SouthSide that you will be amazed at who creative the album and he is.If you buy it you would n't be sorry
 Listening to Play is rather like piling six or seven not-very-compatible CDs into the player and putting the thing on random . Got some gospel , some blues , some dance mix , some poetry . In fact , the CD player is sort of broken and plays some at the same time . And yet it works , mostly.So Play works , mostly , if play can be said to work . Maybe it just plays . __ So , just play it . __
 Brilliant beyond compare - every track is different and somehow every one manages to soar . Work out 2 it , drive 2 it , write 2 it , party 2 it - whatever . It 's a beautiful , wide-ranging work from a wonderfully talented individual - if you do n't have it , for god 's sake go get it .
 This CD is the best money i have ever spent , i love it . You sould buy !
 Play is a brilliant CD , opening with the song honey it has a very old south kind of feel . He really blends so many different styles together in this album that at its first listen you ca n't quite be sure what direction he is taking you.Some songs such as Porcelain , Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad , and The Sky is Broken have a somber and melodic , yet haunting feel to them . Then before you can get too worn down he heads into upbeat danceable tracks like Body Rock and Machete . There are so many styles and textures layered into this album it creates the pattern of the sheer musical genius that is Moby.Simply put this CD is brilliant , and when you listen to it , you will realise why it 's gone mulitple platinum since it 's release . Moby has taken himself to the next level in Play , do n't miss out on this one .
 Finally , after two years of critical hype and media-inflated importance , I succumbed in the music store and bought a copy of `` Play '' . Generally I do n't agree with most critical favourites ; most music critics also write for the cooking section in whatever publication they derive their income from . And while I ca n't agree that it 's the masterpiece so many people seem to think it is , I will admit that I had a hard time hating this album.For one thing , it 's unabashedly mellow in it 's lighter moments ; remeniscent of a more imaginative Enigma . I 've got a soft spot in my heart for any album that can chill me out on a rough day , and many of the tracks herein can do that for you.Ironically , I exiled myself from TV way before this was released , so it 's play on numerous commercials has had no ` sickening ' effect on me . It 's in no way innovative , but rather -LRB- as Joni Mitchell once said about Prince -RRB- , it 's extremely well-crafted . From techno to break-beats , to muzak , to movie score-esque melodies , to bastard blues breaks -LRB- sampled , of course -RRB- , it 's got something for everybody , really . Worth picking up .
 A must own . It 's got a little bit of everything . I put it in the same company as Achtung Baby or The Bends .
 I have n't stopped listening to this CD since I bought it . It is the kind of CD you can listen to no matter what mood you are in or what you are doing . Absolutely the best CD I have heard in a long time .
 `` Play '' is an excellent piece of work and a turning point for Moby as it introduces us to his ambient side . Certainly one of the best electronica albums in recent memory . The CD begins with a bang but the 2nd half flows to a mellow chillout state of mind ... . Lately , there has been a great crop of electronic ambient releases , among them
 Moby can be more downbeat an introspective than most other techo artists -LRB- Fatboy Slim , say -RRB- and that is a compliment . There are no bad songs on this album and many have now seeped into popular consciousness ; like Porceline and Southside . One word of warning
 I have to admit , I did not want to like Moby at first . Some girl begged me to pop it into my cd player one day when this album was still kinda fresh . I heard Moby was dorky , but I actually liked some songs from here like Porcelain , Machete , GuitarFluteString , and the last one . I thought a couple songs from Everything is Wrong were decent too . Now I heard a live rave album that I downloaded by Moby from Audio Galaxy from a few years back ... NOW THAT WAS GOOD . Moby should stick to that type of stuff because otherwise his stuff all sounds the same .
 This Is The Symptom Of The Universe By Black Sabbath Says I Do n't Know That Black Sabbath Played From Kansas All The Time Like This .
 I am very happy with the product I purchased through Amazon . Everything was as reported and shipping dates were accurate .
 In the mood for some original beats ? Try the much talked about `` Bodyrock '' . Yearning for a simple uplifting verse ? Then `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad '' will deliver . A must have . Worth it and the endless minutes of joy this cd provides .
 I like the CD . I found a real interesting way to be a part of Moby 's music by mixing your own version of body rock at beatnik.com .
 So far , my pick of ' 99 . Moby manages to sample and pay tribute to everything from wailing blues -LRB- `` find my baby '' , `` natural blues '' -RRB- to soul -LRB- `` why does my heart ... '' -RRB- to techno -LRB- `` bodyrock '' -RRB- , and get it right every time . `` Everloving '' is one of my standout tracks of the decade . This album is more versatile and varied than his earlier `` Everything is Wrong '' , and should appeal to anyone who 's interested in exploring new directions in dance music .
 A friend travelling to the USA got this CD for me -LRB- Moby is not big in JA -RRB- and he would n't give it to me for nearly a month . At last I have my hands on it , and I can see why I had to pry it loose . Particularly taken with the hauntingly beautiful `` Everloving '' , a subtle and seductive guitar piece . Am generally addicted to the entire CD and have been unable to listen to anything else for a week . It does suck you in , this one .
 If you are one of the few who has yet to be exposed to this , do yourself a favor and give it a try . There are some amazing moments of beauty here , Moby has proven to be very proficient at creating very high `` highs '' , while other tracks will just make you want to move . The sound is unique and eclectic , so at least two listens are warranted . There are very few , if any , dull moments throughout the 18 tracks , making it a very solid album . My personal favorites are `` My Weakness '' and `` Everloving '' ... this is an inspired work in which Moby has perfected his sound . ...
 I 'VE BEEN A FAN OF MOBY SINCE A CHILD . AND I MEAN A DIEHARD FAN . MOBY IS ONE OF THE MANY REASON 'S I BECAME A VEGETARIAN . HIS ESSAY 'S AND MESSAGES ARE SO POWERFUL AND CONVICING IT 'S HARD TO TURN A COLD SHOULDER . I HAVE BEEN OBSSESED WITH HIS ALMOST AMBIENT GROOVES AND MELANCHOLY STYLE SINCE I HEARD EVERYTHING IS WRONG . THAT WAS A MORE TECHNO BASED ALBUM , IN CONTRAST TO ANIMAL IGHT 'S WHICH WAS A MORE ROUGH SOUNDING , AND INSTRUMENAL BASED ALBUM IF YOU ASK ME . OF COURSE ONCE AGAIN MOBY HAS WRITEN , PLAYED AND PRODUCED MOSTLY EVERYTHING HERE . IN THIS ALBUM , INSTEAD OF HAVING A HEALTHY VARIETY OF MELLOW TUNES AND HYPER-PACED , HIGH ENERGY , BEAT ORIENTED SONGS HE HAS MANY MORE MELLOW-TONE BUILDING -LRB- SLOWY CLIMAXING TO A STILL MELLOW PINNACLE -RRB- SONGS WHICH DRIVE INTO YOU AND STICK . SDO N'T GET ME WRONG , IT 'S STILL GREAT , SORRY WILL BE THE DAY THAT I EVER BAD-MOUTH MOBY , I MEAN HE WOULD 'VE HAD TO HAVE DONE SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONG TO GET THAT FROM ME . I PLAYT LISTEN AND WRITE POLITICAL PUNK MUSIC BUT MOBY IS A VERY GREAT MELLOW AND POLITICAL MUIC WHICH I WHOLY AGREE WITH ON MANY OF HIS MESSAGES . THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM TO JUST HANG OUT AND RELAXE TO . I GUESS I JUST MISSED THE ENERGETIC SONGS WHICH USSUALLY ACOMPANY HIS MUCH MELLOWER MUSIC . BUT STILL A GOOD ALBUM . IT DOES HAVE THE SONG BODYROCK WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT JUST WANT 'S TO MAKE ME GET UP AND SKATEBOARD , WHICH IS SOMETHING I OFTEN DO TO THAT SONG , BUT IT IS ONLY ONE HIGH ENERGY SONG . GOOD ALBUM , NOT HIS BEST IN MY OPINION , THAT RIGHT IS RESERVED TO ANIMAL RIGHTS , BUT MOST CERTAINLY WORTHY TO GET . DO NOT MISS THIS .
 moby has done excellent with this album ... i can not get enough . it moves me inside , my heart is in my throat , it brings joy and sadness at the same time . this album is very spiritual , on a musical level .
 `` Play '' is a gem-laden , ethereal mine of feeling and sound . `` Porcelain '' has to be one of the most gorgeous , genuine , heartfelt pieces of music I 've heard by any artist , in any genre , from any period . `` BodyRock '' , quite simply , rocks . The rest of the tunes range from haunting to driving , bluesy to poetic and everything in between . There are only a few half-formed throwaway tracks here . This is my first Moby album , and I think the guy is very talented . Recommend this disc to any music-lovers who claim electronica lacks the soul , realness , and beauty of other genres -- and be willing to lend a hand in removing their feet from their mouths the next day .
 A really good CD ... I would n't classify it techno , but great pop ... It has it all dance rock , slow , medium ... my favorite cut is `` Bodyrock '' ... gets my butt of the couch and rock ... I was surprised to see it as the theme song now to `` Veronica 's Closet '' on NBC ... you should catch the intro on the show , it is pretty rockin ! ... Any way back to the album , other great songs are the ambient `` My Weakness '' and the soul full `` Run On '' . Catch this CD soon , it will fit all tastes .
 This CD by Moby has to be one of the best cds that i 've ever had the pleasure of owning . Everytime through it is pure listening pleasure . It has everything needed in one cd ; fast-tempo , dance , as well as relaxation . One could just about go to sleep during this cd , but you do n't want to because it is so good
 I do not like much electronica or techno , but this CD surpasses genre and comes up with some really great music . First half is much more solid than second , which drifts into ambient territory . I would recommend this album to all people looking for good music among the dreck .
 moby takes us by the hand through his incredible journies of exploration in every single aspect of music known . he is a very nice person and he cares about you feeling the music with him . i found this album to do more for me than i expected . `` GO '' for it ! ; -RRB-
 Let yourself go ... fall in love with Moby ... damn he is good . Every song ... yes ... every song is good if not great . Enjoy .
 This album is just incredible ! Though , after buying 3 with manufacturing defects , I finally got the fourth one today which played ! Sorry Amazon , I had to cancel the 5th . Moby is a genius , perhaps Mozart come back again . Buy this album without hesitation !
 I 've got everything he 's done and this album is the most unique , different , and thoughful album of his . He has changed so much since `` Moby '' , which is hard techno , this is a lot softer with grooving beats and the occasional techno-ish tune . Thankfully , no hard core fast crap like on `` Everything is wrong . '' A great album , but if you 're looking for `` classic '' Moby , buy `` MOBY '' or `` Move . '' They rock !
 i 've only recently gotten into the electronic/digital/techno scene , and i had once bought everything is wrong on a whim . while i liked it it did n't knock me off my feet . this did . there is such a smooth blend of harmony , rythym , and heart in this album to leave you begging for more . highly reccomended .
 I wo n't bore you with the same ecstatic praise as all the other fans of this album . One recommendation , though . Listen to track 14 with headphones . Loud , of course .
 I have never been a big fan of Moby . His tracks were typically very annoying and repetative , although he had some great tunes here and there.He tries something completely unique with his latest release . He combines classic African-American blues and folk with modern dance beats and melodies.This has never been attempted , but Moby pulls it off with flying colours ! The tunes are very catchy and highly enjoyable . Recommended ...
 WOW !!!! What else can I say ? Within a few tracks of this remarkable offering I knew that this would be one of those CD 's that will become a near-permanent member of my 3-CD carousel . I love techno & trip hop but little did I realize how delightful those styles would be when combined with gospel and blues as Moby seamlessly did here . The only CD I can think of that will compete with `` Play '' for my attention is the equally impressive -LRB- yet different -RRB- `` Moon Safari '' by Air .
 I 'm a lover of FATBOY SLIM , but after a while I feel like I 'm just a series of twenty dollar bills being withdrawn from an ATM . Moby finds a heart and blood and pours it into his electronic box . Out comes music with a narrative that transcends the `` cut and paste '' process by which it is made . Between the bits , we find love , like walking through a cemetary and missing the strangers beneath the stones . He has brought men and women back to life to dance in a funky groove . A miracle .
 Moby truly is a musical genius . I ca n't deny that he 's terribly influencial to the rest of the techno/dance/electronica world . After listening to Honey and Run On , I would n't be surprised if we hear more music like this from other artists . Play is another fine album with music similar to that of his album Everything is Wrong , one of his absolute finest . And his social comments found in the insert are always a treat to read since I could n't agree with them more . Props to you , Moby .
 after moby 's last effort -LRB- animal rights -RRB- , i was n't too anxious for `` play '' . MISTAKE . i listened to some of the clips and went out and got it . i love it . his GENIUS -LRB- not genious -RRB- is clearly evident at the variety of his music . i 'm not sure it 's my favorite moby album , but it 's close . do n't compare him to fatboy , moby 's in a league of his own .
 Another unbelievably brilliant album from techno 's self-professed Little Idiot . Much is being made about Moby 's sampling of old-time R&B and folk recordings on this record ; sure , they 're fantastic pieces of work -LRB- and for me personally the most fulfilling -- `` Run On '' is just SO damn catchy -RRB- , but if you 're some kind of bizarre techno-purist then you 've got plenty to go on with PLAY , from the fast-paced cascade of `` Machete '' to the sprawling electro-rock brothers-gonna-work-it-out fable `` South Side '' . I sound like some kind of propaganda machine , but heck , maybe I am ; God knows this album deserves promoting . Listen and buy .
 I am a huge fan of Moby and I love this CD . It 's a little different from his earlier stuff but it 's amazing anyway . I do n't think long time Moby fans will be disappointed at all .
 I had never heard of Moby until I bought this album . I kept hearing his name and bought `` Play '' on a whim . And I 'm glad I did because I would 've never ventured into the field of techno -LRB- i.e. Daft Punk -RRB- . Although I 'm not a vegan , I respect Moby 's faith , because I 'm a religious person also . I 'm a fan of all genres of music , but I assumed techno was strictly ambient/electronic/dancy music . Moby sets himself apart from the techno bunch with this negro spiritual-inspired , 18-track opus . It 's amazing how you can take a plain ol' sample , add some tranquil , melodic background music and create a compelling work out of it . Add that to the fact that Moby is practically a one-man band and did all of the musical work himself . From classical to rock to techno , there 's a song for everyone . All in all , this album is a classic . And you do n't even have to be a fan of the genre . I would 've given this 4 1/2 stars , but that 's not an option , is it ? Nope . My top 5 are `` Porcelain '' -LRB- my favorite one -RRB- , `` Southside '' , `` Rushing '' , `` Bodyrock '' , and `` Inside '' -LRB- my second favorite one -RRB- . An honorable mention to `` Run On '' as well , because the lyrics coupled with the beat makes for a quite catchy song . If you do n't own anything by Moby because you do n't like techno , you should at least give it one complete listen . I did n't think I would be too thrilled about it either . Granted , there could 've been less repetitiveness with the samples , but it 's something that you can listen to straight thru . You can scoff at Moby if you want to , but do you think today 's generation would even consider listening to late 1800 's / early 1900 's plantation music ? I 'd probably squirm in my seat ...
 Moby 's become a little more funky and diverse since Everything Is Wrong , which was his ecletic masterpiece . `` Honey '' and `` Run On '' are prime examples of that , a soul/scat verse set against piano . There 's more bluesy soul in `` Natural Blues . '' You know , `` Oh lordy , troubles so hard . '' And `` Find My Baby '' plays at the blues set to a synth-beat with some guitar coming in later in the song.I find myself leaning towards Moby 's ballads or melancholy songs `` Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad ? '' is my pick here , and the soulful words match the wistful symphonic music . Then comes `` My Weakness , '' which has an African choir or something mixed in with synth-strings brimming of the sadness of infinity . `` Rushing '' and the self-explanatory `` Guitar Flute & String '' are other in the softer category . `` Bodyrock '' a rap sample played against his usual keyboards , but it 's novel in some way . `` Machete '' is kind of a throwback to his earlier daysNote
 This is one of the best CD 's that I have purchased in a long time . I love it ! Definitely recommend this CD !
 I just got the new Moby CD , and it 's more inovative than I thought it was going to be . The patterns and beats change from song to song keeping it from seeming too repetative . However , there are some weak points in the CD . At some points some of the songs seem a little thin , as it is hard to put out 18 good solid songs . I would have rather seen him put out 12 or so songs that were more concentrated and solid than a few great songs , mostly descent songs , and a couple that just plain lack . I would have also liked to see some more instruments used within a song . I mean if you 're gon na over dub and mix like he does , I think you should have a wide arrangment of instruments/noises in a song instead of one or two sounds in a song . Let me put it this way , a full orchestra sounds better than a violin , a snare drummer , and a flute . Not too say this is a bad CD at all , it 's great . The flows are smooth and the rythms kickin ' . I would suggest buying this CD .
 i think moby is a talented person . This is techno , but I do n't listen to this type of music often because i find it 's boring , but he makes it interesting for me . i think a lot of different people can appreciate this recording .
 After hearing this album OVER AND OVER I eventually began to like it and finally purchased it . Although some of the songs are really just mixes of other songs , the art is n't lost . There 's alot of creativity to be found here . Enjoy it .
 I 'll admit it
 When I first got this CD I did n't know what to expect , because I had only heard one Moby song . But when I first started listening to it I could n't take off my headphones because every song on this CD is so great.My favorites on this CD are `` Body Rock '' , `` Porcelain '' , `` South Side '' , `` Natrual Blues '' , and `` Run On '' . But do n't get me wrong , every song is good.Buy this CD , it 's a must have .
 I would point out its highlights , but I 'd have to copy over almost the entire track list . You can just put it in and listen through . The album is amazing .
 After owning this cd for about a month and a half , i am FINALLY ready to review it . You see , this is a very unusual album , that demands repeated listenings to be fully understood . Here i go . My absolute FAVORITE songs are
 I actually enjoy Moby for more of his ambient stuff , which is pretty much the 2nd half of this CD . But the first half of the disc is still very well written ! From songs like `` Honey '' , to `` Inside '' and the very chilling `` My Weakness '' you cant miss on this one . Moby definetly struck a winner with this album .
 This CD is my Fav . There are songs to mellow down to -LRB- Porcelain -RRB- , songs to party with -LRB- Bodyrock -RRB- , and songs that are just fun -LRB- Southside -RRB- . Anybody would like this cd . I 've played this cd for some of my friends and they all loved it .
 Well , I just love when someone has the nerve to set up an electronic beat to most to our beloved melodies ! The beat , so easy , so calm , so practical ! Moby has made my life so much easier ; now I can explain to my 1st grade students why any tune can be so easily followed by clapping hands . It was difficult for them to keep up with the metronome ... But hey ! , this is not Julliard !!!
 Great CD . I ordered this because my pilates instructor runs this during pilates & it is great to exercise to . Now I am completly hooked & play it all the time in the car . Very eclectic music . Was as advertised .
 Just bought this CD a couple of weeks ago . I enjoyed listening to it because there 's something different about these music compared to contemporary ones . Although obviously they are very modern , you can say Moby 's technique of utilizing notes harks back to medieval times . The prolongation of some notes -LRB- which are hypnotizing -RRB- resembles those of the chants used in religious services . The transitions can be compared to majority of the classical/baroque music . And who could miss the vocals that resemble arias ?
 This is the album that got me hooked on Moby . I 've been a fan ever since.It goes without saying , I recommend it very highly .
 Moby defies categorization , in my view . He cuts across all kinds of music types , and has opened my eyes to other sounds . He is very talented . I think this is his best album .
 This album is Moby at his peak . By far his best and most energetic album . He had not produced anything better before that album and has not produced anything as good since . Actually his albums seem to be deteriorating since he produced this .
 this album is a classic in the chillout / atmospheric genre . fusing blues riffs and electronic meanderings . Moby is definitelly a great talented musician .
 Almost all the tracks on this one are winners . Lots of music for the money . Wo n't get old too quick - you can keep coming back to this one .
 I have not heard some of the songs off here.This was used in millions of comercials and plus it has some good songs from what I heard.I will say this is one of the biggest albums in Techno history and it was a huge surprise hit sold more after a while see Norah Jones and even more O Brother where are thou.He deserved his praise on here . `` He may be a soyberger but his music is a Double Bacon cheesburger `` Chris Thur 6/22/04 12:50 Lyrics 10/10 Production 10/10 Music 10/10 Style 10/10 Voice 10Overall = 50/50 This is a great album I need to buy
 This entire album rocks . The only problem i heard was the placement and order of some of the songs . There would be a nice ambient song and you would be thinking how nice it was and suddenly fast pace blaring techno is flung at you . I also want to compliment track 15 , `` Inside '' . Many people overlook this song but in reality , it is very good .
 Moby is here with his latest achievement , `` Play '' . This has to be one of the most interesting albums I 've ever purchased . Here 's a breakdown of my favorite tracks :3 . Porcelain - one of the best songs on the album . Nice dance tune , relaxing . I love the parts with the piano playing ! 7 . Bodyrock - Ranks up there with Fatboy Slim 's `` Rockefeller Skank '' . Awesome beat .8 . Natural Blues - The reason I bought this album . This one track sounded so good -LRB- and the music video was well done , too -RRB- .11 . Run On - Very enjoyable song . My dad likes this one .15 . Inside - High-tech . Really cool . Listen to it ! 16 . Guitar Flute & String - A little short , but sounds really nice and relaxing.Well , that 's about it . If you enjoy relaxing songs or like to dance or just like electronica , get this wonderful album !
 I bought this cd the week it came out , not even knowing what kind of music it was , the girl at the store recommended to me so i bought it . Since then I have purchased four other Moby CD 's -LRB- Animal Rights , Everything is wrong , Songs and I Like To Score -RRB- and I 've actually given copies of this CD to friends . I even bought the Limited Edition 2 CD Boxed set with Play
 This is one of my favorite electronic albums . I rate it up there with Basement Jaxx `` Remedy '' , Daft Punk , Prodigy 's first 2 albums , Orb 's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld , DJ Shadow , ect . Its a good album with alot of variety . Songs like `` Porcelien '' , `` My Weakness '' , are the best , but every song is great ! I love this album , and I 'm looking forward to furture Moby releases .
 `` Play '' was my first introduction to Moby . I remember when I lived in Milwaukee in 1999 , I had lived with three other people . One of my roommates had bought the original version of `` Play '' -LRB- which the version of the hit `` South Side '' did not have Gwen Stefani on vocals -RRB- . My roommate would have `` Play '' on his stereo non-stop . It did not take me very long to fall in love with the album . I eventually acquired my own copy of `` Play '' . Personally I think this is Moby 's best album I have heard . After picking up few more of his cds , I noticed that `` Play '' picked up where `` Everything is Wrong '' left off with the gospel-infused techno sound . The majority of `` Play '' is good but there were a couple of misses . I hate saying this but Gwen Stefani has an annoying voice . I find her voice quite shrill . She totally ruins `` South Side '' . I much prefer the original version which did not include her on the track . I was not really too keen on `` Find My Baby '' or `` Bodyrock '' . Personally I absolutely loved the gospel infused `` Why Does My Heart Feel so Bad ? '' . It is a gorgeous ballad . Techno music rarely sounds emotional but in this particular case , the heartache in the gospel sample shines through . As overplayed as `` Porcelain '' was on various soundtracks and chill out compilations , I still love the beautiful melodies . The techno tracks are easily the best tracks on the cd while the more guitar orientated tracks were not as good . Nevertheless , I still consider `` Play '' a classic album in the electronic genre .
 What an album ! - Amicable and brilliant . This album reminds me of a four-wheel drive SUV bought at a rock-bottom price . This album can please anyone , of any music taste . When `` PLAY '' was released , MOBY was kind of an underground artist / producer . His earlier albums like `` ANIMAL RIGHTS '' enjoyed very little popularity and success . Even `` PLAY '' was a sluggish starter . It had its own unique sound
 With his 1999 album , Play , Moby proves himself an expert musical chemist . A cornucopia of styles are processed into the New York City DJ 's samplers and synthesizers and some of the most unlikely pairings surface . Techno beats mix with rich , folky earthiness -LRB- `` Everflowing '' -RRB- . Gospel vocals mix with Brian Eno-ish effects -LRB- `` Natural Blues '' -RRB- . Punk rock ferocity mixes with progrock keyboard-gloss -LRB- `` Machete '' -RRB- . Trip-hop smoothness mixes with singer-songwriter reflections -LRB- `` Porcelain '' -RRB- . And hard rock surrealism mixes with dance music bleeps and buzzes -LRB- `` Southside '' -RRB- . Unlike contemporaries , such as Fatboy Slim and Basement Jaxx , Moby 's mergers never come across as smirky or slapstick . He merely isolates what precisely makes each genre sound mournful , serene , intense or what makes about each genus makes a listenor get-up and dance and combines them with the appropriate aspects from another genre , resulting with tracks that resonate in said atmosphere . If one could earn a PHD in pop music amalgamation , Play would act as a fine thesis .
 Okay , I am not that into blues , but this is a great CD and I suggest you buy it . It is awesome and James is an awesome guitar teacher and player .
 Just good music with something for everyone ... be prepared to sing along though
 James Quill Smith is a master guitarist , sliding from honkey-tonk blues , to country , to burning rock with an ease that underscores his extensive professional resume . This is a fun , well crafted , and really rockin ' CD from the first track to the last.Favorite tracks
 This is my first exposure to Chrome , but I 'd say its a great way to get to know them . A double Cd for pretty cheap ... The studio stuff is wonderful . . the vocals , the guitar , the drums ... all sound great -LRB- or terrible depending on your tastes -RRB- . Twisted , acid drenched punk . Sounds a lot like you feel when you 're coming down off of a trip ... THe live set is from 1998 , but it still rocks . The vocals on the 1st song are very Resident-esque . If you 've heard The Delta 72 , Flipper , The Stooges , The Residents , and perhaps King Crimson -LRB- ? -RRB- , or are generally into musical perversions . . buy this man !
 Just a few comments . Rick Wright 's rather startling revelation that Syd broke down over the course of one weekend is n't supported by the facts . Rick says that Syd did n't show up for a BBC radio spot - this was on the final Friday of July ' 67 . Rick then states that Syd did n't turn up again until `` Sunday or Monday '' and the Floyd 's management told him that `` something had happened to Syd . `` Problem is , every other source for the `` BBC breakdown '' say that Syd DID turn up for the spot but `` freaked out '' during it , and the piece was never aired . Furthermore , the Floyd played 2 shows that very evening at the UFO and 2 more on Saturday , including an all-nite rave `` Love-In . '' so for Rick to state that Syd disappeared for the weekend does n't seem possible . How could they play 4 shows during Syd 's disappearance ? The radio show that Rick refers to has got to be the BBC Saturday Club taping to which I 'm referring , as there were no other Friday radio tapings during this entire period when Syd was breaking down.I 'd also like to comment on Jerry Shirley 's point that Syd seemed to be faking his illness . I 've always wondered about that too . By December '67 we all know Syd looked fried , EMI was refusing to release his singles because they were supposedly no good , Syd could n't play anymore and could n't function in a band , etc. etc. etc.Thing is , the footage here of the Floyd on Tomorrow 's World shows the band playing an excellent space-blues tune and Syd 's playing is excellent . Add in the second BBC session , also from December , and it 's pretty clear that Syd COULD still play , and quite well . That Tomorrow 's World footage is some of the best playing I 've heard from him . And the songs that EMI was rejecting - Vegetable Man and Scream thy last Scream , are two of his best songs ! Given all of this evidence , literally weeks after the disasterous US Tour , the American Bandstand meltdown etc. makes me wonder if Jerry Shirley might be right . Food for thought anyway.As for the DVD , the Astronomy Domine footage is the best quality I 've ever seen , and the aforementioned Tomorrow 's World footage is priceless ... but why in God 's name do they insist on showing only a few seconds-cut to some vapid interview - cut back to the footage - etc. ? And where 's the American Bandstand footage and the Jugband Blues promo ? The Syd Barrett Under Review DVD has those , but they also insisted on showing us only isolated clips from the footage . This historic and rare footage should at LEAST have been included uncut as bonus material instead of pointless cover versions of Syd 's songs.The interviews with the band members and friends are great , and the Vegetable Man promo was fantastic to finally see , even if once again they did n't let us see ALL of it . This DVD is great , but could have been better with uncut footage from Look of the Week , Tomorrow 's World , the promo vids , etc. .
 Firstly , I am a big time Pink Floyd and Syd fan , and had seen this docu on TV and decided to get it for myself , mostly for the DVD extras . I found the full interviews interesting , but I felt that the interviewer did n't do the best job in asking questions . Such as when he interviewed Roger Waters and asks him about the last time he saw Syd , he says that he once saw him in Harrod 's but Syd did n't see him , etc. . I so wanted to hear the question `` and what year was that ? '' but got ... nothing . I felt that the guys being interviewed were a bit frustrated as well by not getting more questions . Overall , I very much like this and recommend it especially if you want to know more about Syd and what happened . I do wish it had more footage of them playing in the Syd days , I know more is out there .
 Not too long and not too short . Detailed and sentimental . Great footage , photos and acoustic performances to steal licks from . I am an avid Syd Barrett listener and was well pleased right down to the interviews with Floyd members .
 Fantastic . Yeah , it could have been longer , and they could have included more , but just to get so many , such heartfelt interviews with Roger , David , Nick and Rick is worth it alone.Plus , they found a really wide assortment of people who knew Syd , and I found their stories really fascinating and touching - seems Syd touched everybody around him .
 There is no doubt a Hollywood feature film will soon follow on this subject . You can see Syd 's downfall truly had a deep and lasting impact on all the Floyd members . What makes this cautionary tale interesting , is that the well liked founder of the group , head song writer , lead guitarist , lead singer & pop icon that brought them to stardom ; was slowley going insane ... Seeing a distressed Fyold member discribe a fat bald completely shaved Syd jumping up and down brushing his teeth during the recording sesion of Shine On is worth the price of this DVD alone .
 THIS WAS EVEN BETTER THAN I REMEMBERED IT WHEN I SAW IT ON VH1 . I THINK THAT ANYONE WHO IS A FAN OF PINK FLOYD WILL DEFINITELY WANT TO ADD THIS DVD TO THEIR COLLECTION . TELLS THE STORY OF HOW THE BAND GOT STARTED , HOW SYD LOST HIS WAY -LRB- SO TO SPEAK -RRB- AND HOW SOME OF THE WORLD 'S BEST SONGS WERE CREATED/WRITTEN . DEFINITELY ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING DVD 'S I HAVE EVER SEEN .
 This is a story many Floyd fans know , I wanted to own it . This is the main focus of Pink Floyd . True Friendship .
 I was a huge Pink Floyd fan in college . As a musician , this band really shaped the style of music I play and listen to . If you are a fan of Pink Floyd , especially the mystery that surrounds the early years , then this DVD is a must-own . There 's plenty of rare footage of all the guys . It details the tragic story of Syd quite well . There are a lot of great interviews too , as well as plenty of psychedelic music .
 This DVD is a trip back in time.Very enjoyable , but short of it.Anyway it is a great collectable for your dvd library , buy it and see for yourself .
 SIMPLY PUT , AMUST HAVE FOR ALL FLOYD FANS , WHO WANT TO GET THE EARLY FLOYD HISTORY FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE GROUP THEMSELVES .
 This DVD answered almost all of my questions regarding Pink Floyd.Very recommended !
 A good -LRB- if not interstellar -RRB- overview of Roger `` Syd '' Barrett and the early days of Pink Floyd . The DVD tells the story of Barrett 's brilliant rise with the band , and his subsequent acid-fueled fall into schizophrenia.The main drawback is a maddening lack of supporting video and pictures . -LRB- Several years ago , VH1 ran a similar documentary that included a treasure trove of video , including the legendary `` American Bandstand '' appearance in 1967 . -RRB- In fact , much of the vintage footage appears to come from the `` Syd 's First Trip '' video , the `` Arnold Layne '' promotional film , and a performance of `` Astronomy Domine . '' Besides a glimpse of the unreleased `` Vegetable Man '' film -LRB- with the soundtrack clearly using audio from the bootleg version -RRB- there is little of unique historical value.The interviews are the high point of the DVD , particularly the observations by Roger Waters . His comments are by turns poignant , funny , and sad , and are obviously heartfelt . The other members of the band also share their memories -LRB- although Nick Mason seems less than fond of Syd -RRB- . The extras are a bit thin , incorporating expanded interviews with Waters and David Gilmour , and three acoustic performances of Barrett songs by Robyn Hitchcock and Graham Coxon . A digital collection of posters and other memorabilia is a nice touch , but -LRB- at least on my player -RRB- can not be paused . Sadly , the extras do not include any of the promotional films or performances.Any serious Barrett or Pink Floyd fan will want to own this DVD , if only for the interviews , and the great cover art . It 's also a nice introduction for anyone curious about the subject . But I will continue to hope for a more detailed and comprehensive overview of Syd Barrett and the early Floyd .
 For those of us in America , this was the original documentary chopped up into the version shown on VH1 . This documentary is infinitely superior to the US for a few key reasons . Mostly because it is more detailed about the later history of Syd 's life and music and because it allows for the possibility that Syd was n't just an acid casualty , but something more interesting . Perhaps he deliberately used his `` breakdown '' as an excuse . If so , his continued silence has probably gotten him more than if he 'd broken it . As a Syd Barrett fan , it is important that something about the man should appear , beyond the rip-offs like `` Syd 's First Trip '' . The story is told in chronological order with interesting interviews with every member of the band , apart from Syd , of course . Roger `` Syd '' Barrett has basically turned his back on the world of music for 30 years , despite the underground cult he seems to feed by doing so . It is ironic that his absence should be the cause of his continued fascination . No doubt if he turned up on an interview , now a much older man -LRB- as are the rest of Pink Floyd -RRB- it would be a pin in the balloon.This documentary is really both for fans and non-fans alike . It glosses over periods , while expounds on others . The music is inter-cut throughout , with some nice emphasis on the later solo work . The major inaccuracy that seems to occur because of editing , is the one that comes up all the time . It 's a question of timeline . Syd was ousted from the band in 1968 , though they did record a few of his songs -LRB- some are still unreleased , one appeared on the 1968 Saucerful of Secrets album . -RRB- Syd 's solo recordings began in 1968 and were carried into 1969 . Much of the first solo LP was recorded in that period , but was n't released until 1970 . The second solo album was recorded quickly in 1970 and released at the end of that same year . It was then , and only then , that Syd really stopped.The documentary is good . I recommend it . For the fan , its essential . For the casual watcher , its really interesting stuff . It certainly gives perspective on everything Pink Floyd did afterward .
 This is a decent history of Syd and the Pink Floyd -LRB- the narration could have been better written and delivered -RRB- , but there should be more footage , more interviews , more analysis , better graphics , etc. . This DVD is about an hour long . Which is maddening . It 's like getting a single bite from a fantastic piece of cake on a buffet table filled with gastronomic riches , and then being shuffled out of the eatery . I do n't understand why there is n't a 9 or 10 DVD set on the history of Pink Floyd with at least 6 hours on just Syd ? Where are all the TV show performances ? They are one of the biggest bands of all time , and this is the only DVD history of the band in its early days ? We 've got a lousy biography -LRB- Saucerful of Secrets -RRB- written by the wrong author -LRB- thank god Nick Mason has a book coming out -RRB- -- and a couple of compilations of old clippings . With the Beatles there are literally hundreds of books to read . We 've got the `` ANTHOLOGY '' DVD set . But with the Floyd we get these measly little crumbs . What are they thinking ? David Gilmour , Roger Waters , Richard Wright and Nick Mason should put together a big DVD history of their band , before everyone worth interviewing dies out . The people from their generation are beginning to drop like flies . There 's little time left to put something together . And what 's up with the cover picture on this DVD ? It 's low-budget horrible !
 Being a huge Syd Barrett/early Floyd fan I was VERY eager to see this and I must say I was not disappointed . It is amazing in many ways , the most obvious ways being it is the FIRST official Syd/early Floyd documentary -LRB- I 've never seen the VH-1 Floyd Behind the Music episode -RRB- and it has recent in depth interviews with Roger Waters , Nick Mason , Rick Wright , and David Gilmour as well as close friends of Syd 's like Bob Klose . You really get a feel of how each member feels toward Syd and his breakdown , the most touching one from Roger ! There is some great early performance footage of Floyd with Syd and even a brief clip of an interview with Syd himself -LRB- when will they release ALL of it ??? -RRB- . The DVD never gets boring and even spices things up a bit with interviews with modern day artists like Robyn Hitchcock -LRB- a self-professed Syd-head ! -RRB- . Another great thing about this DVD is the fact that they do n't really delve into what Floyd did after Syd left and instead it focuses on Syd 's all too brief solo career . It 's definitely a fitting tribute to Syd and the only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars was the fact that they did n't include more bonus features of the full length early footage and interviews with Syd . So please , whomever has the rights to that footage , PLEEEASE , PLEEEEASE lift a hand and RELEASE IT !!! ; -RRB-
 I was never too into Pink Floyd outside of Piper at the Gates of Dawn -LRB- I very much enjoy Pink Floyd 's other albums , though -RRB- , and I was also a longtime fan of Syd Barrett -LRB- being one of my personal favorites - next to the Beach Boys , Love , and the Zombies -RRB- ... I saw this title at my local Circuit City for $ 14.99 and purchased it instantly.I watched it , having not really known the whole Syd Barrett story before , only knowing that he screwed himself up with LSD and then disappeared into obscurity ... this tells it all , from the Pink Floyd members and friends/fans/acquaintances of his from that era -LRB- Robyn Hitchcock , Humble Pie , the guitarist of Blur , old room mates , etc -RRB- . They tell it very well . There is some good footage on here and they explain alot of the writing process of earlier songs and Syd 's solo stuff , even his shortlived stint with the band `` The Stars '' . The best thing about this documentary is that it really respects Syd and you can see how much Roger , David , & co. really loved him and how they were changed by what happened to Syd . It 's a sad film , in a way . They shy away from taking any low blows and making Syd 's mental instability a spectacle ... which I thought was in very good taste.I have a greater appreciation for Syd Barrett & Pink Floyd having seen this , having seen who they are and -LRB- somewhat -RRB- understanding the story now.Vegetable man where you . . ?
 -LRB- ... -RRB- having seen the flower-power-cover on the edition here on the amazon.com I think I preffer mine - not that it matters much , it 's a minor detail considering what 's `` inside '' . I will start by saying that this documentary answered many of my questions about the mysterious Syd , and the origin of one of my favorite bands , and even `` The Wall '' that now has got a whole new meaning to me . I did not know -LRB- though I had expected it -RRB- that much of the Pink-character was inspired by the life -LRB- and fate -RRB- of Syd Barrett . I had never heard that coming from Roger Waters ' mouth until now , and of course ; It makes sence having always thought that it was mainly inspired from the life of Roger himself -LRB- which it also partly is -RRB- , but as mentioned the Pink-character has always reminded more to me of Syd . So now the `` bricks seem more fit '' -LRB- though to many Floyd-fans this might be old news , I do n't know . . ? -RRB- What the about 45 minutes documentary is missing is actually more of Syd . Ironically it does being mainly a tribute to him , and his genious . We see tiny bits of an interview he and Roger once did , I wanted to hear more . We see tiny bits of some rare consert-footage with Syd in the lead , but I wanted to see more . We see plenty of old photographs of Syd , which is great -LRB- many of those photos are great , and say so much about his condition by looking at the captured expressions on his face becoming more and more unrecognizable -RRB- , but all in all I was still `` hungry '' after watching it the first time . And I still am . Much of what lies out on the internet are rumours and lies when it comes to facts about Syd - so I ca n't help feeling a bit let down by an otherwise so great documentary about one of the most peculiar personalities in the history of rock 'n roll.So if you are interested in Floyd , this one 's a `` must '' !
 It was good to see so much information from people who were around first-hand during the early days with Syd . This DVD is an excellent source of information about Pink Floyd 's original inspiration , and does n't get mired down in a lot of gossip or diagnosis ... just personal accounts by the ones who knew Syd best and who can therefore provide the rest of us with a detail that 's often overlooked when appreciating Pink Floyd 's genuis as a band .
 The DVD starts out with footage from a vintage Pink Floyd concert fronted by -LRB- of course -RRB- Syd Barrett . That only lasts a few seconds , like most of the concert footage.This DVD is a documentary of the Syd Barrett years and a very entertaining one at that . It 's well worth adding to your collection if you 're a Floyd fan.The bonus features are interesting , but could have been much better . Concert footage -LRB- featuring entire songs , not snippets -RRB- from the early days of Floyd would have been perfect to add , and would make this DVD a 5-star masterpiece . I know there 's footage of Syd & Floyd in concert performing Astronomy Domine - why not add that instead of cover versions of Barrett & Floyd songs?Oh well , it gets four stars anyhow . Very well done , despite the flaws .
 Syd Barrett will be greatly missed . His whimsical songwriting style was unique and greatly influenced many famous musicians like David Bowie . This dvd is an essential purchase for those wishing to know about a genuis .
 If you did n't catch their first self-titled cd , you may want to -- the sonic power of this release will inspire many repeated listenings . This is not classic rock , nor mindless improvisation , despite the rather traditional setup of guitar , bass , drumset and percussion . But the intensity of the sound , and the keen sense of each other 's musical intonations will have you wondering where in the world have these guys been ? Karl Precoda , previously heard awhile back in Dream Sydicate , powers this band with his edgy , feedback-laden and sometimes psychedelic guitar -- the sound is awash with lots of reverb , tremolo , and wah , but always tasteful . The bass playing is solid and musical , and the drums extremely well balanced and energetic . Some of the sounds seem to come out of nowhere , and it is difficult to pinpoint who is playing what at times , which is of course what the band are attempting to achieve . Improvisational/experimental rock -LRB- ? -RRB- that actually sounds better at every listening ? Check it out .
 Not only is this one of Buddy Guy 's best album you could easily make a case this is on the blues ' finest recordings . The album is short with less then 40 minutes of playing time , but the songs are great and the backing band is awesome -LRB- Spann , Wells -RRB- . Buddy guitar playing and vocal styles are full of emotion and flair and the songs are a lot of fun . If you like the blues and in particular Chicago Blues this is a great album to buy.This version -LRB- Japenese import -RRB- includes two bonus tracks that are not found on the domestic version .
 The Gold Star Band will just not let up . This , their third CD , is so tight , so open , so incredibly well played . Jazz ? I guess . Free jazz ? Some of it . Ensemble playing ? A lot , but also great solos . Charlie Waters ' reeds continue to amaze , but who does n't on this CD . The addition of Kim Lemonde 's cello on three cuts is welcome . More of that of CD # 4 I hope . Trumpet 's not my instrument of choice normally , but Roger Ruzow could change my mind . He and Waters keep up `` intensity with taste '' - a rare combo . And Baker and Roberts ' rhythm section pushes and supports and pushes and supports and ... hey , just focus on bass and drums and you 'll like the CD . The only weak link is the band 's name -LRB- Gold Sparkle ? -RRB- If Kenny G. is your idea of jazz , pass on this . If , say , Ken Vandermark or Ellery Eskelin provide the challenges you have to have in music , then order Nu Soul and listen to it , then listen to it again . And again . And marvel at how it continues to reveal itself more each time . Then take a break only long enough to buy Downsizing and Earthmover -LRB- in that order -RRB- .
 Damn this album is good ! Definately worth of 5 stars . More given today 's music scene . This album and Tommy Castro as an artist give me new hope that music , rock in perticular , is not dead , but a healthy breathing animal . ` Right As Rain ' has got to be one of the best blues or blues/rock albums I 've heard since Indigenous , Mark Selby or B.B. King . I found him right away on the internet and ran right out to buy the album . Ca n't wait to get ahold of his other stuff .
 The thing that drew me to this CD was the name of the record label ... Blind Pig Records . Finding this funny and cute -LRB- which is n't the right word but I ca n't think of a better one right now -RRB- , I bought Right as Rain . I opened it in the car and inserted it into the CD player.Tommy sure likes them horns , which is a nice touch to the music . -LRB- The backup singers are also very cool . -RRB- Castro has a nice voice , it is n't all over the place and out of pitch like some other blues guitar/singers . Another thing I like about this album is the straight beats . This guy sure is n't afraid to wail on a straight blues beat , and they make you tap your foot , there 's no stopping it.Of course , the real talent on this record is Castro 's guitar playing . He reminds me of SRV in more ways then one , but nonetheless he still has a great style of playing.This CD is well derserving of my rare 5 star rating . Well done , Tommy !
 Wow ! Only recently was I turned on to Tommy Castro , and my life is better for it ! Grittier and more soulful than Cray , but very rocking , Tommy has perfected the Memphis blues sound . Great vocals , plenty of horns and a dash of Sam and Dave . If you 're unsure of the blues , this CD is extremely accessible , yet represents the finest of the genre . I may never take this disc out of my car !
 I came across this CD by chance . Wow , what a find ! This guy has a GREAT blues/roadhouse rock voice . Nice guitar work , too . I 'm a big Delbert McClinton fan and this CD has a similar but more bluesy sound . Their voices are remarkedly alike . So much so that when they sing together on `` Do n't Turn Your Heater Down '' I have a hard time keeping them straight . Best song is `` Just a Man '' . `` Kickin ' In '' is excellent , too .
 Tommy Castro 's best work to date . You ca n't go wrong with Delbert McKlinton and Dr.John as your parners in crime.Keith Crossman shows some killer chops on saxaphone , and Tommy C peals the paint with some stellar guitar licks . If you like rockin ' blues hot and loud , this is the CD .
 I really like this cd.The first three songs on this disc are just killer cuts.My kind of woman is also an excellant song.Where tommy gets in trouble is when he trys to get away from the blues , something that he does quite well.This is a good buy if you like the blues.Also check out exception to the rule .
 I recently purchased this CD and let me tell you one thing , Tommy Castro is one great guitar player . Lucky in Love is bound to have you going 80 in a matter of no time . This is one of my first true blues CD 's that I have ever owned . Tommy Castro gives all his energy into this CD . He also has one hell of a voice , and when the sax gets played with it , you can feel the soul and power that he has . Every song on here , is worth giving a listen to . I 'll tell you one thing , this is definitely worth your money !!
 Do n't pay any attention to the philistine who gave this CD one star ... let the other reviews speak for themselves ... Tommy Castro puts more energy , heart , and soul into his music than anyone I 've ever seen , and this CD proves it ! It 's what Modern Blues is all about ... Feel Good ! Tommy 's feelin ' good , and it shows !
 Hey all , do n't listen to that first * one star * case of mistaken identity . Tommy Castro is the REAL DEAL , one of the hottest performers anywhere in today 's BluesWorld . Sure , he may not be the songwriter of your dreams , he might not be the guitar slinger that keeps young boys awake at night ... but he is the total package that hooks you solid , sinks his passionate blues blend hook smack dab into your soul while makin ' your body wiggle and toes a-tappin ' all night long . See him live and you 'll know what us TCer 's already know - he 's one of the funkiest , tightest and hip blues/soul/funksters around . That 's it , buy everything he has out -LRB- they 're all great -RRB- and hit the highway with the volume control maxed out .
 THIS RIGHT AS RAIN ALBUM IS ALL GOOD . CASTRO 'S GUITAR PLAYING IS TOP SHELF . LIKE HIS OTHER ALBUM THIS MUSIC WILL OPEN ALOT OF YOUNG MUSIC LISTENERS EYES AND EARS TO THE BLUES . THIS ALBUM SHOWS WHERE BLUES WILL BE GOING IN 2K .
 Tommy Castro 's `` Right as Rain '' is just what the blues world needs . Just the right mix of vocals , horns , and guitar solos . Unlike other blues guitarists , Tommy does n't feel the need to spend 50 % of the music on guitar solos . When he does solo , he 's as good as anyone out there . Basically , the solos complement the music without detracting from it . Put this CD on for your next party . You ca n't go wrong !!
 Tommy Castro and his band , demonstrates what it is all about to being top rated musicians once again with Right as Rain , They work together to bring us classic soul and blues with masterful musicianship . Tommy Castro 's guitar playing just gets better and better and his James Brown type vocals add to the enjoyment of listening to his latest CD . Mr. Castro is now the new Chairman of the Board , whether he likes it or not . M. Manley -LRB- Syracuse , N.Y. -RRB-
 Hot , Hot , Hot
 This guy is great . I disagree that he lacks subtlety . I would not change a thing about him . This CD cooks .
 Tommy Castro takes a pinch of R&B , adds a jigger of motown , stirs in some soul and cools things off with some icy guitar riffs . He gets the foot tapping and lifts the spirits with his ever-improving ability to get into the right groove .
 I 've been in love with Castro 's driving blues since I saw him at a festival in Wisconsin last August . This is another testimony to his fantastic ability to get blues fans up and shakin ' !
 If you like the blues and like to rock , then you 're going to enjoy each of the cuts on Tommy Castro 's new CD.This is my first CD from him that I bought , and since purchasing it , I have bought his other 3 CDs .
 On the Top of the Heap !! Pick any Tommy and Dig it !
 Once again , The Tommy Castro Band has assembled a soulful collection of blues destined to become classics . His originality and trademark sound weave colorfully through the powerful and inventive rhythms provided by band newcomer , drummer Billy Lee Lewis . Our ears are appeased by the smooth-as-silk vocals , but the rest of our bodies ca n't sit still to the driving beat that is inevitably dancible . Like wine and cheese this man , this sound , this music only gets better .
 I recently purchased this CD and let me tell you one thing , Tommy Castro is one great guitar player . Lucky in Love is bound to have you going 80 in a matter of no time .

I 'll tell you one thing , this is definitely worth your money !!
 I first listened to this CD while driving across Nevada . Perfect cruising music . I dare you to listen and not tap your foot . I must have listened to it three or four times and never got sick of it -- a really good sign for any CD . This remains one of my overall favorites and my favorite Tommy Castro.Tommy is a very talented guitaris and singer , but what really makes his music for me is the sax . It is unbeatable . He has his own very stripped-down take on the blues that is different from everybody else and very listen-able .
 This cd should bring The Tommy Castro Band all the recognition they deserve . This band is the future of Blues . My personal favorites are `` Like an angel '' , `` Chairman of the board '' and `` Just a Man '' . Tommys crisp guitar and vocals on `` right as rain '' are outstanding
 This video is a superb example of true Russian/Soviet trained dancers combined with Soviet style of `` cultural propaganda '' . The film -LRB- created in 1964 -RRB- was made to be shown in the movie theaters to bring more art to the masses -LRB- let 's not forget that the arts were on very high level in former Soviet Union and still are in the present-day Russia -RRB- . This movie-version style should explain somewhat choppy cinematography . On the other hand , it 's is a classic that should be owned by all avid ballet lovers as well as by those who are just remotely interested in ballet . It is a great family movie!The dancers in the main roles were the stars of the Kirov Ballet in the 60 's and 70 's . How can one go wrong in owning a tape with such stars in their prime as Alla Sizova , Yuri Soloviev , Natalia Dudinskaya , Natalia Makarova , Valeri Panov among many others ? To any ballet student this should be a historic recording of what true classical training can produce . It 's a pure academy of dance ! For someone to say that the dancers are out of shape , because they might seem a little more meatier than our present-day concept of bones , is absurd ! After all , it 's the muscle that gets you up into the air -- not bones.Alla Sizova was a lyrical dancer with pure classical style training and faultless technique . She received gold medal at Varna competition in 1964 , and it 's safe to assume that this ballet was filmed shortly after that . She was very popular in England when Kirov Ballet toured there . Unfortunately , she had a back injury and was n't able to dance for 2 years , but she came back to dance and tour with Kirov in England and Europe without any loss of her brilliant technique . Presently , I believe , she is teaching in Washington D.C.Yuri Soloviev was one of the most talented dancers that Russian and world ballet ever had . His technique was impeccable , his jumps absolutely breathtaking and ... his life was extinquished much too soon for us to enjoy his talent . If for nothing else , one should have this tape to remember Soloviev 's extraordinary talent.Moreover , this film captured very young Natalia Makarova in the role of Princess Florina.I hope this insight is somewhat helpful .
 If you know `` Sleeping Beauty '' , the reason to have this `` Beauty '' is the superlative dancing by Sizova and Soloviev . Nobody dances like them any more , and it 's our loss . Sizova dances with a spontaneity and musical emphasis unlike any other Kirov dancer I 've ever seen . Her Aurora was a vital part of the Kirov 's first sensational tours of the West in the 1960s ; curiously , I saw her dance Princess Florine at the Kirov in Act III in 1984 , and even then she was dancing with amazing freshness - alas , by that point , a freshness unlike anyone in the company . Even though Soloviev is n't really a prince -LRB- he was a very famous Bluebird -RRB- , he becomes a hero like no other - utterly innocent and caught up in the story as if for the first time . Latterday Kirov or Western dancers would dance this ballet with more attention to minor technical perfection and with less feeling for dance and music and character . To watch how Sizova 's torso is always alive through each dance is glorious , and the way that Soloviev effortlessly phrases his series of double tours en l'air like a continuous outpouring of one single ardent thought -LRB- whereas most dancers present them like one technical cliche after another -RRB- is thrilling even if you 've seen this ballet more than two hundred times in the theatre . When I first saw this film in the early 1980s , the Kirov was seldom seen in Britain or America , and it was one kind of revelation . It does n't , however , represent how the Kirov 's production worked in the theatre , it has a partly bad text -LRB- Carabosse danced on pointe and acted heavily by Natalia Dudinskaya -RRB- , and it 's heavily cut . Now that I 've seen the Kirov and its various `` Beauty '' productions many times , this film is a different kind of revelation
 Sizova and Soloviev , as well as Valery Panov as the Bluebird are wonderful . It 's definitely worth buying , but many of the most famous dances have been shortened considerably in this video .
 Made in 1964 , and looking every bit of it , this rare and unique rendition is in color but it is a silent film . We hear only the music of Tchaikovsky 's ballet and the performers strutting their stuff against a collage of lush scenery - the Palace , the Forest , a lake , Carobosse 's realm , etc. . The music is terribly rendered . Moving to swiftly and having none of the finesse and bravura that is Tchaikovsky , the emphasis of this video is on the dancers . They are excellent , of course , providing drama in everything from their leaps to the look in their faces . I.E. . The King and Queen shine with parental bliss upon the Christening of their daughter Aurora , are horrified upon the emergence of the menacing Carobosee -LRB- looking like a woman who has taken a hallucigenic drug -RRB- and grief-stricken upon Aurora 's death when she pricks her finger . The finale is nothing more than cute customes and light dancing and the finale as the Prince and Aurora travel on a boat across the skies , is very disappointing . But still if you enjoy ballet this tape can be for you , though there are better versions out there -LRB- look for the Viviana Durante as Aurora -RRB- .
 This Sleeping Beauty filmed in 1964 is a treasure for any ballet lover . As they used to say in the ballet worlds of New York , London and Paris back in the 1970 's , `` The wrong dancers defected from the Kirov . '' Meaning , that instead of Misha Barishnakov and Natalia Makarova , it should have been Yuri Soloviev and Alla Sizova who defected to the West , since they were far greater and supreme dancers . Soloviev had the biggest leaps of any dancer then or now , as well as a stunning charisma . His death at the age of 37 , probably committing suicide , in 1977 , was a great and tragic loss . He left a daughter who became a Kirov dancer . And Alla Sisova had a back injury that she never recovered from that unfortunately cut her career short , but I 'm not certain what year she stopped dancing . Their beauty and brillance captured in this filmed version of Beauty shows us that they were not legends for nothing . Also Natalie Dudinskaya dancing Carrabosse , she was probably in her 50 's when this was filmed , leaves on film for posterity her greatness as a dancer . What must she have been like in her dancing when she was younger ? Nureyev always revered her . And he always spoke fondly of both Soloviev and Sizova .
 Before the initial worldwide tour of the Leningrad Kirov Ballet in 1961 , its rival Bolshoi Ballet troupe was the generally accepted company of choice for the performance of archetypal Russian dance . However , the Kirov brought something fresh with them that charmed balletomanes - - an emphasis upon clarity of line for traditional works , showcasing roles that were filled by an extraordinary assemblage of soloists which , in general , lacked the vigour displayed by Bolshoi dancers . This film was constructed in 1965 following the previous year 's second tour by the Kirov , and will receive high marks from many aficionados of dance . It is shot at the Kirov 's home , Saint Petersburg 's Maryinsky Theatre , being an enactment applying the original 1890 choreography created by Marius Petipa , although there are over an hour of cuts made from Tschaikowsky 's score , with several numbers being shortened , while others are excised or repositioned . Lamentably , among these cuts are a portion of the Blue Bird solos -LRB- Valeri Panov -RRB- as well as the adagio from the Grand Pas de Deux , danced here by Alla Sizova and Yuri Solovyov . Nonetheless , most viewers will accept these deletions as the work is intriguingly untypical in many ways when compared with most filmed ballets , with a result that one 's interest is heightened from outstanding set and costume design , along with cinematic special effects that can not be found with stagebound productions . It is widely printed that Rudolf Nureyev , who had discarded his Soviet citizenship by defecting to the West -LRB- leaving the Kirov in 1961 -RRB- , would consider returning to the U.S.S.R. only if he could once again partner Sizova , and it is not difficult to understand the temper of his statement as the prima ballerina , performing here as Princess Aurora , displays ravishing extensions along with her emblematic velvety soft jumps . She is matched by the gifted Solovyov whose singular mastery of elevation is evident dancing as Desire -LRB- Prince Charming -RRB- . Additionally , ballerina Natalia Makarova is pure elegance as Princess Florina while veteran ballerina and coach Natalia Dudinskaya is dramatically convincing as the evil fairy Carabosse , albeit she dances the role en pointe . The well-trained corps de ballet is tantamount to perfection . The striking Vaganova method of arm positioning has long been with the company -LRB- wherein it was derived -RRB- and it is something wondrous upon which to focus while viewing this film . One of the finest exponents of that school during the 1960s is the incomparable Kaleria Fedicheva , cast here as one of the five good fairies . Fedicheva , who became successful as a highly valued teacher in the United States following her defection , demonstrates here that she is a true balletic blade , cutting through the air as she generates a theatric interpretation of her character . Based upon a late 17th century fairy tale by Charles Perrault , The Sleeping Princess is provided with a fantasy plotline of great intensity in addition to inherent visual appeal , and the unique stagecraft utilized for this production offers not merely proficient employment of machinery , but also an opportunity for vividly interpretive acting and dancing , with skilled film editing being a decisively significant segment of the mix . The film is an artistic achievement for which all engaged in its making may well be pleased . This would include the Leningrad Opera and Ballet Theatre Orchestra , as well as the entire cast of dancers and many others of the production team , as the work 's emotional impact reflects the efforts of a combination of diverse talents . Cinematographer Anatoli Nazarov employs numerous closeups and a broad range of camera angles , including overhead , that exhibits -LRB- in conjunction with artistic montage effects -RRB- especially telling effects fashioned by the design teams . This film has been released upon a less than completely satisfactory DVD , and most viewers will incline toward a 1990 Kultur VHS version that , while rather difficult to locate , and suffering from some colour washout , is yet presented in letterbox format that maintains the original aspect ratio of its Cinemascopic theatrical release prints .
 No one in our family is an expert . This is a pure entertainment value rating from a family that loves many types of music and dance.This tape , pluses and minuses , deserves 5 stars in our family , because it is simply so beautiful to watch , so engaging . It feels like a ballet AND a gripping story both , moreso than some of the other ballets we own , which can feel a bit like a plodding story as we wait for the next dance part worth watching . -LRB- La Bayadere comes to mind . -RRB- The minuses
 I got a copy of this tape as a gift , and never thought what a jewel for the ballet this tape IS . After watching it , I became a fan of Alla Sizova and Yuri Soloviov , because they danced more deep than just a perfect technique , they had style , grace , musicality and fluidity.Even though Makarova was more known in America because of the international projection and is considered one of the top ballerinas in the 60s , 70s and 80s , Sizova is even better because she could actually jump and turn , unlike Makarova -LRB- watch her in Royal Ballet 's Swan Lake 1982 -RRB- , and her style was always so pure and clean.Soloviov is amazing too , he does n't actually look like a real prince , but after watching his dance , there was no doubt about who the prince was . Lilac fairy did a great job , though sometimes she looks a little out of proportion , she could balance her size with her delicacy.I fully recommend this tape , though it looks old , is a classic for every balletomane and even kids who like to see a lovely story , russian style .
 I have owned Warrior of the Heart for many years and hoped the artist had more CD 's . I told myself not to expect to much but when I recieved and listened to this I was so pleased ! Like Warrior of the Heart , each track is superb . I 'm so happy to have taken a chance on this , fantastic !
 I still love this album after years.I do n't agree with the first reviewer about the production values , cut shocks , and that sort of thing
 The music on this CD is really quite innovative and a load of fun to listen to . Track number 2 is especially nice , and has a storytelling feel to it . Overall the music is an excellent blend of acousitc folky sounds augmented with synthesizers that fill out the pieces and complement the vocals . The production values , however , really bother me . Some of the cuts are really `` in your face '' and could have been recorded at a lower dB setting . Others on the same CD are very quiet . If you set the sound for the quiet tunes you are in for a rude shock every now and again ...
 This album highlights Teri 's singing and songwriting , enhanced by collaborations with Willie Nelson and Bonnie Bramlett . Two of the songs were written by Randy Travis and Joel Friedman , who also collaborated with Teri on `` Find Your Way Back To Me . '' The songs are a wide-ranging collection of genres , Christian contemporary , country , blues , and rock , that shows off Teri 's remarkable songwriting talents . The title track won the 2005 Nashville Embassy Music Songwriters Contest.It opens with a blues tinged `` Sign of the Times , '' with an apocalyptic theme . `` Best Thing In Texas '' is a slower blues-country flavor song featuring the harmonica played by Guy Forsyth . `` Will I Find You '' is a slow ballad about the longing for a partner in love . `` Home To You Hawaii '' reflects the longing to return to the islands where she has lived for many years , with a slack key guitar . `` Rock In The Hoof '' is a slow country flavor song ostensibly about a horse . The first Randy Travis song written for this album `` Love No Longer Lives In My Neck Of The Woods '' is sung with sparse instrumentation , guitar and fiddle , a tender lost love themed song , sung with Willie Nelson . This is followed by an up-tempo `` Something Good '' with a religious flavor , anticipating all sorts of possibilities . The heart of this album comes next with the wonderful `` Follow Me '' , with a story line of a dream about being called by Christ to follow Him to Calvary , along the Via Dolorosa . Immediately followed by another Christian-themed song , `` Coming Home , '' with a phrase slightly reminiscent of `` Going Home . '' These moving songs are followed by `` Find Your Way Back To Me , '' reminiscing about a former lover and wishing he would come back . Next , a somewhat faster tempo blues song , `` Wise Up , Woman '' , teamed up with country icon Bonnie Bramlett . The final song is `` The Eyes , '' originally written back in 1989 , about seeing Jesus in everyone she meets . Altogether , this album is thoughtful and heartfelt , and Teri 's inimitable style and vocal talent shines in every song . At the time this album was released , Teri had written well over 200 songs . It 's more like 400 now ! But there are n't many copies of this album out there .
 Last weekend I heard Ms. Garrsion at a Wayne Dyer lecture . Of all places ! She has the voice of an angel . This is the first recording artist I have ever heard that sounds as good in person as on tape .
 I have not yet bought this CD , but I did see her play live in Maui last week ... . She has an amazing voice , you will not be disappointed !
 Teri Garrison has been compared to Janis Joplin as one of the hottest blues singers around . This album pairs her with legends Bonnie Bramlett -LRB- Wise Up Woman -RRB- and Willie Nelson -LRB- Love No Longer Lives in My Neck of the Woods -RRB- . TERI GARRISON is a unique and expressive singer who has performed with everyone from WILLIE DIXON to WILLIE NELSON . Years as a background singer have given way to a vibrant performing and recording career both solo and in front of her own band . Musicians in her live and studio bands have included DAVID LINDLEY , JEFF BAXTER , MICKEY RAPHAEL , ROCK DEDRICK , GUY FORSYTH , JOHNNY GIMBEL , ROBBEN FORD , RUSS KUNKEL , KENNY LYON and ROBBEN FORD.Having recently returned from a Midwest road tour opening for WILLIE NELSON , TERI is just releasing her new CD
 It is hard to imagine a more deft live recording than `` Trail , '' which hauls its listener along with a globetrotting and vital working band . Jimmy LaFave and his gang of musical cohorts ooze integrity from every pore in this collection , and they take American music right into the faces of audiences all over the world . The pacing here is superb and LaFave 's tributes to Dylan et al. make it easy to understand how the author of a tune might not be its best interpreter . And LaFave has the ability to bring out the sometimes hidden best in a song , as though a new angle occurs to him right on stage . Every step of the way , he keeps faith with his audience . There are n't many musicians of his caliber who have n't been tempted to stray from what they do best . But LaFave apparently has stayed on the straight and narrow . His dedication shows here , and it has been worth his long years of experience on the road to hear the maturity in these recordings . There is soul here , plenty , plenty soul . And this collection rewards relistening . It gets better and better which each play . Get it ! Devour it !
 So , you like to go out to those smoky live music clubs where everything 's authentic . Well , here 's your chance . Jimmy Lafave is famous for his intensity . If you want to hear a guy tear his heat out , Jimmy delivers . Want to hear him at his best , try him when he 's in some night dive -- Austin to Amsterdam , Stillwater to Switzerland . We 're talking bootleg style here , tapes taken when he 's pouring his heart out to fans across the globe . That includes the -LRB- now -RRB- famous tribute to Bob Dylan sessions in Austin and parts across the map . But , if you really want to tap the Jimmy LaFave experience , try him at blues , hear him sing `` Have You Ever Loved A Woman . '' But , do n't doubt that the Favester can cover range in the 31 cuts of these two CDs . He can rock too ! This may be the very best of all the LaFave offerings so far . When you 've listened to these two CDs a few times , you 'll feel like you 've travelled with Jimmy and his musical Marines across the globe . Get to the end , and if at `` Hold On '' you are n't tapping your foot with an entertained smile , then book yourself into a home for the criminally music insane . 'Cause this is the real deal . LaFave 's for REAL !
 A few years ago , I was introduced to Jimmy 's music by a friend in Austin , Texas -- Jimmy 's stomping grounds . With the first song I heard , I knew that I was listening to something very special . I have since purchased all of Jimmy 's CDs , and listen to him more than any other artist in my collection.Life is n't fair , you know . I always listen to Jimmy , and wonder why he is n't a household word . He is truly as good as ANYONE of the pantheon of great rockers , and often covers the superstars ' songs better than they did in their originals . That is not , in any way , to take away from his original work , either , which is a wonderful amalgam of American blues , folk , rock , and country.If you do n't own a Jimmy cd , buy one now . I promise you that you will buy the rest of them too .
 Once you buy one CD by Jimmy LaFave , you buy all the rest . I 've been listening to him all summer and have yet to tire of a single song . The joy his music has brought to me can not be equaled . This two-CD set of mostly but not all Dylan is one of those desert-island choices . The Favestir -- I love that ! -- also seems like the nicest guy on the planet . I echo all the praise of the other reviewers . Bless Jimmy LaFave .
 I cant say that Jimmy Lafave really meant all that much to me . Apart , that is , from Going Home , a better song than Bruce Springsteen , for example , ever wrote -LRB- although Dead Man Walking comes close -RRB- . But Trail is a gem in its entirety . Lafave manages to sing songs by the likes of Dylan and Springsteen better than Dylan and Springsteen , as if they were his own . Going Home , by the way , is on it too . It is the heartbraching ache in Lafaves voice that will never stop to amaze me . And touch me , like very few voices do . Absolutely brilliant !
 As a newbie to the Texas capitol city -LRB- I 've lived here barely 2 years -RRB- , I 've tried to see my fair share of local artists . And by far , Jimmy LaFave is THE BEST ! He is what I love about Austin ! Whenever he makes an appearance at the Cactus Cafe , I try to be there ... And his Trails album is by far my favourite ! Everyone I 've ever lent this CD to has absolutely loved it ... Simply , its a must have .
 Wow ! I picked up this CD randomly and what a blessing it turned out to be ! The lyrics are filled with praise to the Lord and the melodies are soulful . Both up tempo beats and slow smooth sounds are on the album .
 The music on this CD is definitely annointed by the Lord . I was blessed by the upbeat songs as well as the slower ones . The music is very uplifting and encouraging . Each song was very thought provoking . The music was so soothing that it put my grandson to sleep while riding in the car . A wonderful work totally giving praise to God all the way through .
 Ordered one product billed for and received three products , will not order from amazon again
 I met Jeff when we were both in college together . He is one of the most talented musicians to ever come out of the state of Maine . Do yourself a favor and pick up his CD , put it in your car audio roll down the windows and crank up `` Benny '' . It 'll put a smile on your face !
 Jeff Hook can make you laugh or cry with his music , but what he does best is make you think . He is the best musician that you never heard of and his music is an undiscovered gem . Those who have had the privilege to enjoy him and his music are truly blessed .
 It Aint A Straight Road is a wonderful piece of work . This cd takes you to so many places that you dont know where you have been ... but ... you want to go back.A wonderful mixture of ballards , Pickin , New Age , Rock and on and on you go ... Great Job Jeff !!!! We are waiting for your second act !!!!!!
 Taccani -LRB- 1885-1959 -RRB- had an outstanding spinto with real shine
 The Very Best Of Nancy Sinatra has 21 sublime tracks all featuring Nancy 's incredible talent as a recording star ! She sings very well and she delves deep into everything she sings to bring out all the subtle emotions of the lyrics ; this makes her performance so much more sensitive than the way that just any old `` celebrity '' would do it . The quality of the sound on this album is excellent and the artwork is nicely done.The album begins with one of Nancy 's biggest hits ever , `` These Boots Are Made for Walkin ' . '' Although the tune has a distinct ` 60s flavor to it , it still sounds good today and it has Nancy performing at her very best . `` Good Time Girl '' is easy on the ear ; this playful song features Nancy squarely front and center -- which is right where she belongs ! The backup singers harmonize very well and this makes `` Good Time Girl '' a good number . `` Lightning 's Girl '' has a strong sound to it but the sensual treatment from Nancy makes it alluring and special . `` This Town '' showcases Nancy 's sophisticated phrasing ; and I really like `` So Long Babe '' a lot . The music that plays on `` So Long Babe '' fits in perfectly with Nancy 's vocals ; and that 's excellent . `` Sugar Town '' gets the royal treatment from Nancy who sings this to perfection -- and how 's about that musical interlude ? `` How Does That Grab You , Darlin ' ? '' is quite the feminist song that came out of the ` 60s ; Nancy does this one up right and it 's a highlight of this CD . `` Somethin' Stupid '' is outstanding , this duet with Nancy and her father Frank Sinatra is remarkably sweet and I could never of hearing this charming ballad . `` Somethin' Stupid '' was one of Nancy 's great hits . `` Sorry ` Bout That '' uses the percussion very well and this is another terrific song that has Nancy turning the tables on the guy in her life . `` Summer Wine '' features Lee Hazlewood performing with Nancy Sinatra ; they do this brilliantly and it 's quite memorable . `` Sundown , Sundown '' is another Sinatra/Hazlewood tune that you 're bound to remember ; Nancy sings her part very well , to say the least . In addition , `` 100 Years '' lets Nancy really belt out a tune and make it shine brighter than silver and gold combined -- I love it ! `` I 've Been Down for So Long -LRB- It Looks Like Up to Me -RRB- '' has Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra doing their usual very best ; the melody makes good use of the brass , guitars and percussion , too . `` Bang , Bang -LRB- My Baby Shot Me Down -RRB- '' gets a most passionate treatment from Nancy who never lets go of a single superfluous note ; and the album ends with solo versions of `` Hungry Years '' and `` Barricades & Brickwalls . `` Nancy Sinatra deserves far more recognition that she gets in our times . This is an excellent album for her fans ; and newcomers to Nancy 's artistry would do well to add this CD to their music collections .
 This is a good introduction to Nancy Sinatra 's music . This features a number of her biggest hits , including `` These Boots Are Made For Walkin ' '' , `` Somethin' Stupid '' -LRB- the duet with her father , Frank Sinatra -RRB- and her popular duets with Lee Hazelwood . This compilation also features her stunning version of `` Bang Bang -LRB- My Baby Shot Me Down -RRB- '' which was used so effectively in Quentin Tarantino 's `` Kill Bill Vol . 1 '' . I think her version is superior to Cher 's . My favorite track is Nancy 's `` Good Time Girl '' which is unabashedly cheerful pop . The import price may be high , but if you want a good Nancy Sinatra retrospective , this is worth the money .

 I have not heard anything by this band that I have not liked . UFO and Special Place are particularly good tracks . I would not hesitate to recomend this album or any other by them .
 Only one man truly revolutionized blues harmonica and that was Little Walter.He played `` of the moment '' and in such a unique , haunting , powerful way that his legacy lives on in every blues musician and especially every harmonica player desperately trying to figure out , emulate , analyze , copy his devastating harp licks!This CD offers some beautiful songs , amazing instrumentals , with his vocal quality so understated yet honest .
 From the deep reverb of `` high temperature '' to the rockin ' , driving rhythm of `` my babe '' , this selection of cuts reveals Little Walters ' breadth and command of the diatonic harp as well as the chromatic sticks . Little Walter was an innovator with the electronics-mic-amp-hallway combinations , great studio effects and as the lickin ' - stick `` maestro '' produced the most full-bodied and extraordinary harp sounds and blues music of anyone -- then or now . Contemporary harp players are still playing catch-up to this man . This CD is a must-have for fans of the `` southside Chicago '' 50 's sound .
 I think Little Walter stands right beside Sonny Boy Williamson in Talent.I was a long time resident of the French Quarter of New Orleans . you know back in the days when the music was live , anything canned in those days was vegetables not music lol.Those were the days when you walked to a new club and heard the like of Little Walter and then Sonny Boy and more variety of the best Blues and Jazz than can be imagined.Little Walter is purely among the best ever ... If you like the Blues Harp . . Get him ...
 This is a wonderful disc that gives the listener a sampling of the talents of Little Walter . Although he was a good singer , he is best remembered for his incredible harmonica playing . In fact , he revolutionized the way in which the harmonica is played . His playing has such force and command and he is so versatile with his instrument that he reminds one of a great saxophone player , like Coleman Hawkins , and not a rudimentary Blues harmonica man . This disc is missing `` Juke '' , Walter 's biggest hit , and `` Key To The Highway '' , as well as `` Mean Old World '' , but it 's still a fantastic album with nice packaging .
 Who 's the king of all postwar blues harpists , Chicago division or otherwise ? Why , the virtuosic Little Walter , without a solitary doubt . The fiery harmonica wizard took the humble mouth organ in dazzling amplified directions that were unimaginable prior to his ascendancy . His daring instrumental innovations were so fresh , startling , and ahead of their time that they sometimes sported a jazz sensibility , soaring and swooping in front of snarling guitars and swinging rhythms perfectly suited to Walter 's pioneering flights of fancy.Marion Walter Jacobs was by most accounts an unruly but vastly talented youth who abandoned his rural Louisiana home for the bright lights of New Orleans at age 12 . Walter gradually journeyed north from there , pausing in Helena -LRB- where he hung out with the wizened Sonny Boy Williamson -RRB- , Memphis , and St. Louis before arriving in Chicago in 1946 . The thriving Maxwell Street strip offered a spot for the still-teenaged phenom to hawk his wares . He fell in with local royalty -- Tampa Red and Big Bill Broonzy -- and debuted on wax that same year for the tiny Ora-Nelle logo -LRB- `` I Just Keep Loving Her '' -RRB- in the company of Jimmy Rogers and guitarist Othum Brown . Walter joined forces with Muddy Waters in 1948 ; the resulting stylistic tremors of that coupling are still being felt today . Along with Rogers and Baby Face Leroy Foster , this super-confident young aggregation became informally known as the Headhunters . They would saunter into South side clubs , mount the stage , and proceed to calmly `` cut the heads '' of whomever was booked there that evening.By 1950 , Walter was firmly entrenched as Waters 's studio harpist at Chess as well -LRB- long after Walter had split the Muddy Waters band , Leonard Chess insisted on his participation on waxings -- why split up an unbeatable combination ? -RRB- . That 's how Walter came to record his breakthrough 1952 R&B ; chart-topper `` Juke '' -- the romping instrumental was laid down at the tail end of a Waters session . Suddenly Walter was a star on his own , combining his stunning talents with those of the Aces -LRB- guitarists Louis and David Myers and drummer Fred Below -RRB- and advancing the conception of blues harmonica another few light years with every session he made for Checker Records.From 1952 to 1958 , Walter notched 14 Top Ten R&B ; hits , including `` Sad Hours , '' `` Mean Old World , '' `` Tell Me Mama , '' `` Off the Wall , '' `` Blues with a Feeling , '' `` You 're So Fine , '' a threatening `` You Better Watch Yourself , '' the mournful `` Last Night , '' and a rocking `` My Babe '' that was Willie Dixon 's secularized treatment of the traditional gospel lament `` This Train . '' Throughout his Checker tenure , Walter alternated spine-chilling instrumentals with gritty vocals -LRB- he 's always been underrated in that department ; he was n't Muddy Waters or the Wolf , but who was ? -RRB- . Walter utilized the chromatic harp in ways never before envisioned -LRB- check out his 1956 free-form instrumental `` Teenage Beat , '' with Robert Jr. . Lockwood and Luther Tucker manning the guitars , for proof positive -RRB- . 1959 's determined `` Everything Gon na Be Alright '' was Walter 's last trip to the hit lists ; Chicago blues had faded to a commercial non-entity by then unless your name was Jimmy Reed.Tragically , the '60s saw the harp genius slide steadily into an alcohol-hastened state of unreliability , his once-handsome face becoming a roadmap of scars . In 1964 , he toured Great Britain with the Rolling Stones , who clearly had their priorities in order , but his once-prodigious skills were faltering badly . That sad fact was never more obvious than on 1967 's disastrous summit meeting of Waters , Bo Diddley , and Walter for Chess as the Super Blues Band ; there was nothing super whatsoever about Walter 's lame remakes of `` My Babe '' and `` You Do n't Love Me . `` Walter 's eternally vicious temper led to his violent undoing in 1968 . He was involved in a street fight -LRB- apparently on the losing end , judging from the outcome -RRB- and died from the incident 's after-effects at age 37 . His influence remains inescapable to this day -- it 's unlikely that a blues harpist exists on the face of this earth who does n't worship Little Walter .1 . It Ai n't Right2 . Rocker3 .

 Little Walter died on the third Tuesday in the month of February , 1968 . It was a leap year . I heard it on the radio in my eleven year old Ford station wagon . A little shy of two months later Martin Luther King would be gunned down . Two months following that , another lone gunman would kill Bobby . Though RFK and MLK 's deaths would affect me greatly and along with the war in Vietnam would overshadow everything else that happened in 1968 , the passing of Little Walter , apparently from wounds suffered in a barroom brawl , pierced me to the soul . I did n't know why then and I still do n't . Maybe because his music was so damned fine . Maybe because of the injustice of it all . Maybe because I was young and dumb and was just beginning to understand and worry about this thing called death . I do n't know , but I missed him and it hurt to know he would n't be making any more music.But back in 1963 I reveled in Little Walter and this record . It opens with `` It Ai n't All Right '' , a freight train of a song that rolls right over you . Then it seques right into `` Rocker '' with that blazing , bluesy harmonica cutting you to the quick . It 's an instrumental like no other . I 've played this song soft and I 've played it loud and I 've even played it medium and it 's a train waiting to wreck that never does no matter what volume you play it at.Every song on this record is superb . `` Boom Boom Out Goes the Light '' showcases LW 's harmonica and a bit of bluesy humor . `` Crazy Legs '' is fast and furious and will make you want to jump up and move , really move . `` Confessin ' the Blues '' is what the blues are all about and `` Crazy Mixed-Up World '' seemed to be a song about me . I could n't get it out of my head , still ca n't . This record is like a freight train of souls all packed in tight , all seeking release though the magic voice and harmonica that is Little Walter .
 Essential for anyone trying to play blues on any instrument or anyone interested in wonderful idiosyncratic music with strength .
 Little Walter is a bad man . He is an essential buy for anyone that cares about good music , let alone harp playing or the blues . This music transcends more than the blues though . It 's some rocking stuff , man . I truly ca n't imagine anyone hearing these authentic Little Walter records and not digging them . Unless you care more about Korn and Limp Bizkit . If that 's the case , let ol' Walter bring you back to the real deal .
 Little Walter is one of the originators of modern blues harp style . The most influential harpist ever , and the most creative man . This man bends the note like a hell just like the guitar . This man promoted harmonica to the leading instrument in blues . Essential recording .
 If you 're a Bear Hunks fan , just get it . If you like music from the 1920 's -1930 's , you 'll enjoy it , too . If you 're unfamiliar with this period of music , but are open to new sounds , you will be pleasantly surprised .
 They do such an outstanding job on this , it is great . Saxaphone and swing music heaven on a cd . The sound quality is superb as the Beau Hunks put forth another gem of early musical history .
 Another super group side project , this recording was very well done . Fast guitars , blast beats and insane screaming are all hallmarks of this Black Metal album . This is a combination of the modern take on Black Metal and the 1990 's way of doing things . I recommend this album to anyone who has completed their collection of old Black Metal or who is listening to newer Black Metal . Be sure to check out Satanic Propaganda , Liberation and a cover of Mayhem 's Buried by time and dust on the cd .
 This CD is just awe inspiringly dark , fast and evil black metal . The vocals are perfect , the guitars are lightning fast and Frost is probably the best drummer in black metal , from Satyricon to this band . They could have sped this up but i could have faith that theyre really that good . The production is not like darkthrone like everyone is saying , its exactly like Ulver 's Nattens Madrigal , making those buzz sawing riffs and high snares all throughout the CD , and the arrangements and riffs are like Marduk , so i think those are the two similarities to other bands from 1349 . It is a perfectly brutal , war-like black metal CD , if you like panzer division and Nattens Madrigal , get this as fast as you can .
 This 10 track cd will quite simply blow you away . From the outset the album is pure black carnage with brutal speed . Riders Of The Apocalypse is a fantastic tune , heavy , harsh and yet brought together well by the lyrics . My favourite track off the album is Legion , simple misanphropic style lyrics with charging music to back it up with a very ` march like ' feel to it . Some of the tracks on this album are a little dissapointing but overall the songs that are good are worth the album cost alone .
 Among all the reviewers , has no one considered that this CD 's inhuman speed and strange timbral appearance may stem from cheating ? 1349 sound exactly like when I used to play my late 80s Sodom cassettes with `` high speed dubbing '' for the fun of it . Beyond the shadow of a doubting Thomas these guys allowed themselves a little hoax in that what we 're hearing runs slightly faster than what was initially performed.That does n't make `` Liberation '' bad in any way ... parody or not , this over-the-top version of Darkthrone is definetely a full-fledged black metal album having me ravished with grimness !
 Do you tink that BLACK METAL is stupid?Because you ca n't understand the lyrics and the music is really way too fast in order to understand anything about it ?
 Wow !!! I thought it could n't get much better than Robynn 's `` Modern American Female Gut '' but was I wrong !! The six songs which form `` Paragraph 13 '' capture the intricate melodies and lyrics which are found in all of Ms. Ragland 's compositions . Each one of these songs invite you to join her in a world where love , determination , and heartache combine ; creating a powerful , passionate tapestry of sound and emotion . It is impossible to single out one or two of the songs as above and beyond the others . They all are all simply perfect together , the sequencing building one upon the other , combining to offer the listener a complete vision of the artist 's landscape . `` Paragraph 13 , '' though far too small an offering for such a big talent , makes the perfect complement to Robynn Ragland 's first CD .
 I love this Cd . It incorporated a little old school and a lot of new school with a realaxing mood .
 Obviously , the review below wound up here by mistake.This is not a Julius Patzak cd , but a compact disk dedicated to Wilhelm HESCH -LRB- 1860-1908 -RRB- one of the most scintillating stars of the Mahler era -LSB- from 1895 -RSB- at the Kaiserliche-K &ouml;nigliche Hofoper Wien -LRB- The Vienna Imperial and Royal Court Opera . -RRB- Hesch had a large , majestic , `` black '' bass voice of imposing timbre and breadth , and excelled in a huge repertoire encompassing Mozart , Meyerbeerian Grand Op&eacute;ra , Wagner , Verdi , German Komische works of the Martha and Barbier von Baghdad stripe and a variety of `` modern '' works by the likes of Smetana , Dvorak , Goldmark et al.He died of a rare blood disease when only 48 , but not before creating an impressive legacy of Grammophone & Typewriter disks made between 1903 and 1907 . The large number of these testifies to his great popularity , the breadth of his repertory and the dizzying company he kept
 This CD of operetta items and Viennese songs contains some of the most charming and delightful singing ever recorded.Just sample the Goldsmith of Toledo aria -LRB- not Viennese - by Offenbach ! -RRB- . If that has no appeal for you , it is unlikely that the remainder of the music would be of interest either.Julius Patzak , although lacking that warmth of tone so much the property of Richard Tauber , nevertheless runs his great colleague a near race for the position of most genial , winning tenor in presenting lovely , romantic , lilting melodies.Only some slight harshness in the sound of these transfers precludes what otherwise would be a very well-deserved , 5 star rating .
 Paula Abdul 's first -LRB- and only -RRB- major concert tour was amazing and completely blew me away as a viewer . Seeing all of the dancing and special effects was wonderful for me as a true Paula fan . Even though I felt the show was too short and more songs from her 2 albums -LRB- up to that point -RRB- should have been included besides the obvious hits . Songs like `` Will You Marry Me ? '' , `` Alright Tonight '' and `` State of Attraction '' immediately spring to mind . I recall Paula saying in an interview that she 'd seen both Madonna and Janet Jackson 's tours in 1990 and that she wanted to incorporate some of the energy and spectacle from them but also wanted her show to be more exciting and more striking . Well all I can say is that she most definently succeeded , combining intense dancing , video special effects , surprisingly decent vocals and of all things , flying ballet dancers , Paula 's show was definently one of a kind . Each number performed showed Paula 's versatility as a dancer and choreographer and most of all , an entertainer . This Grammy and Emmy winning performer did n't get half the acclaim and credit she so richly deserved . But this is 1 fan who 's certainly under Paula 's spell . And by the way she looked great contrary to the above opinion , she was nowhere near `` fat '' .
 I was so excitted to find this on DVD , I grew up # 1 FANS OF Janet Jackson and Paula Abdul . They were very popular at the same time but Paula was never able to capture the audience of the mid 90 's with her follow up to Spellbound , `` Head Over Heals '' , instead Janet took over . I think it 's a shame we lost her as a recording artist and performer . I remember seeing Paula for the first time in December of 1991 , in Phoenix , AZ , when I was 13 and in the 7th grade . It was `` The Under My Spell Tour '' and I was so excited to finaly see her Live . I saw her in `` 92 '' as she performed her encore perfomance , and I became so dazzled by her performance . She was truely talented . I wish she would make a come back ! At least I can re live my Paula fanatic days with this performance .
 Paula Abdul launched a headlining worldwide tour in late 1991 that sold out at first but slowly faded away from view . Well , this tape proves the concert had what it takes to be a huge hit ! This is footage from the Japan `` Under My Spell '' tour , and Paula is at her best . The dancing is flawless ; it tunes you in and sticks in your head . Her singing sounds just as good as the CD 's , too . Her image for the concert , the lighting , design and structure are all amazing . Paula really shines in her `` Straight Up '' performance . A classic for Paula fans !
 paula pours her heart and soul into this fun , high energy extravaganza.it 's more than just your run of the mill concert , all the elements are there.great songs , a tight band , energetic dancers and of course amazing choreography.if you 're not a paula abdul fan , you will be one after you watch this .
 If you wan na see why Paula is one America 's most sought after choreographers , and why she ranks with fellow Pop Divas such as Janet Jackson and Madonna -- then you have to get this!Paula 's best work is displayed through her music videos and performances for crying-out-loud !! You CA N'T just have her albums and not see her perform !! This is what she does best . ; - -RRB- This should definitely be in your `` Music Memorabilia '' collection ...
 The real winner here is the `` Straight Up '' performance , with all the flashy special effects , amazing dancing and strong vocals . Many seem so quick to judge Paula 's voice but do n't realize her true , defining talent ; dancing and performing . She 's great ! I also liked her hits from her follow-up `` Spellbound , '' an amazingly successful # 1 album in 1991 . A great collection for this pop diva .
 This is a very rare concert . I 'm very happy to have it . Paula sings LIVE in this concert . No lipsyncing and while she 's not the best singer in the world she sounds great during the show . Im a fan of hers and I love that she didnt lipsync . It 's all about showing the fans you really can sing live . I really dont like when singers dont sing live and she did it here so I was very pleased . She also had a leg injury before this show but put the pain behind her and went out and danced amazingly . She is the true definition of a great performer !
 The spellbound tour was paula abdul 's only actual tour and its a shame because she really puts on an awesome show ! . . i had the chance to catch her show when she came to my city . . and this video captures the magic perfectly!this video was filmed when paula was on tour in the far east and she does not dissapoint . . she gives an incredible performance doing it with CLASS -LRB- gaga pay attention and see how its done right ! -RRB- ... it shows that she pours her heart into every number with passion and sensuality . . that only paula abdul can deliver . . for example when the `` rush rush '' number is on . . you can see the emotion that flows . . just look in her eyes and youll see what im talking about ... she has some funky dance numbers also . . such as the `` straight up '' segment as well as the `` opposites attract '' number where a funny number with mc skat cat is done . plus . . its cute when says a few japanese lines to the crowd :-RRB- its adorable.the camera work done here is terrific . . lots of great pans and close ups . . plus , Paula looks truly BEAUTIFUL . . and is by NO means `` fat '' as stated by some dummy in another review . . to call her fat is just plain stupid ... even now , if im having a bad day or feeling a bit down , ill pop in this concert and it always cheers me up ... bottom line this shows why paula is forever our girl : -RRB-

 ... then you 've got to get this tape ! This sensational concert was filmed in Japan while on the Under My Spell Tour . It 's exactly what you would expect from Paula ! The dancing is awesome ; the whole show is great . You 'll want to watch this tape over and over again !
 i am a big fan of paula abdul.its very hard to find her video tape in asia , i am so glad to get it from amazon Her dance is excellent , but she did n't dance very well during ` straight up ` its a bit bored b4 she sang the ` vibelogy ' she looked a bit fat in her concert but it is still a great video collection for pple who love paula abdul ^ o ^
 extremely happy with CD got the 1st CD and it is my kind of music . just a awesome CD to have
 If you loved Jellyfish you 'll love Shecky . In fact this cd , while not quite in the league of the Jellyfish masterpiece `` Spilt Milk '' , follows a similar direction as each song flows into the next connected by snipets of sound effects and voices . Shecky also has a new cd out -LRB- late 2004 -RRB- entitled `` Itchy '' , which is just as strong ... quirky writing , memorable hooks and harmonies , a very distinctive sound that deserves to be heard . This is the kind of music that gets better and better with each successive play .
 This is has become my new favorite album ... a really cool sound . The harmonies are tight , the instrumentation is awesome , and the lyrics are funny , wacky , and a bit demented all in one . With sound effects interwoven throughout the album , it 's more like a continuous story than a plain old album with songs . Enjoy it if you dare !! Peace .
 I 'm happy to report that this two-CD Ferde Grofe set is a winner from front to cover . Grofe 's 1932 `` Tabloid Suite , '' composed fifteen years after Erik Satie 's music for the ballet `` Parade , '' employs similar sound effects -LRB- including a typewriter and siren -RRB- , similar machine-like rhythms and riffs , and similar contrasts of dynamics and tempi . Even the whole-tone sections -LRB- a Grofe staple -RRB- sound Satie-esque here . No waste of ink , this wonderful piece delights and entertains in both a gaudy yellow-journalistic style and a more thoughtful op-ed fashion . A dizzying , rondo-like `` Run of the News '' is followed by `` Sob Sister , '' a lush and Paul-Whiteman-esque tear-jerker with shades -LRB- so to speak -RRB- of `` Sunset . '' This is the closest we may ever come to hearing the vintage Whiteman outfit in stereo . The suite presses on with the charming and thematically-diverse `` Comic Strip '' -- the best kind of cartoon music , very sardonic and Les Six -- and concludes with the sound-effects festival , `` Going to Press . '' Reprints -- er , reprises -- of earlier themes occur in this , the most `` Parade '' - like movement in the group . If all of this were n't enough , the Metropole Orchestra also delivers a suitably grand version of Grofe 's `` Grand Canyon Suite '' as scored for Paul Whiteman in 1932 . A miracle of orchestration , this more intimate version of the suite might be better , in some ways , than the one we 're used to hearing -- no details of chord or melody are eroded by overactive engineering , and no portion of the brass is lost in the gorge . Here , we have the movement as Grofe intended it to burst . The second CD features Grofe 's fascinating 1928 orchestration of Gershwin 's `` Concerto in F , '' lovingly presented , and with the same refreshing attention to detail . Gershwin 's concerto , while an American classic , is in some ways an odd follow-up to the two masterfully-organized Grofe suites , as Gershwin had none of Grofe 's sense of form . Compared to Ferde 's compositional precision , George 's art was virtually one of filling musical space with sounds . Then again , few people ever filled that space as memorably as he did . Order is n't everything , I suppose . -LRB- But , by all means , order this fabulous CD ! -RRB-
 Basta Records , a Netherlands-based record label , continues to impress with their Ferde Grofe recordings . The latest offering includes ` Tabloid Suite ' , a little known work , along with the familiar ` Grand Canyon Suite ' . The bonus disc is Gershwin 's ` Concerto in F ' . All are presented in their original Jazz Band orchestrations , which were commissioned by Paul Whiteman . Moreover , that are presented without any cuts to the music -LSB- ie . previous 78rpm recordings of ` Grand Canyon ' and ` Concerto in F ' featured shortened versions , which were taylored to fit the length of the discs -RSB- . Good sound and excellent , informative annotation . Highly recommended .

 Preiser 's release of this classic recording of Daniel Francois Auber 's delightful FRA DIAVOLO is certainly welcome . Recorded during the last year of World War II under difficult circumstances , this issue brings together some of the finest German talent of the time . Kurt Bohme , a young Gottlob Frick , and Lorenz Fehenberger head the fine cast ; everyone is in good voice and seems to have a rollicking good time.This particular recording was once available on LP on the old Urania label . Preiser has released it in good sound -LRB- it was most likely a radio broadcast recorded on magnetophonic tape -RRB- . Preiser also gives us some interesting add-ons of famous artists singing excerpts and scenes from FRA DIAVOLO.Finally , while the Preiser Records issue is quite welcome , let me recommend that listeners also acquire the classic old Laurel & Hardy movie based on the same opera . Its on VHS and the print is nice ; and Laurel and Hardy add their own element of humor to the affair . One has to think that Auber would have approved .
 Daniel-Franois-Esprit Auber was a prolific & leading composer of French opera in his time , even though his operas are scarcely ever performed today -LRB- with the exception of this work

 As an engineer who 's been around Silicon Valley when the chips were down , I really appreciate Rick 's take on life as it is here . His `` Dot.Com '' song tells it like it is . And I loved `` Oscar Hammerstein ! '' But more than just gimmicky words , they 're well strung together , and sung in a voice that 's real easy to listen to - and backed up by that good `` virtual band '' music . This is one I 'll keep listening to till it 's wore out !
 I heard a couple of tracks from this band on 88.5 in Atlanta in 1998 and after searching high and low , gave up on ever finding their CD . Suddenly in Philadelphia this last summer , I was bumming in a CD shop , and found 2 albums . I really fretted about buying the new album because I had n't heard any tracks , but it stayed in my car 's 6 cd changer until just last week.It 's the perfect summer and sunny day album - ca n't help but love the upbeat music . There are a couple of slower songs that I regularly skip over , but they 're far and few between , and really are n't bad - I 've just listened to the album so much.Such a sweet voice !
 this is the album people . a great cd to listen to wheather you 're happy or sad ... this album has everything u want and done beautifully by kara lefty . buy it !
 In 1966 , I was 30 years old . That makes me OLD when comes to evaluating Rock and Roll which in my opinion died in about 1968 . This is right down the alley for music for people my age and I think the selection is great . Now , thanks to CD I can play this kind of music to calm me as I have to share the road with these infernal BOOM - BOOM ultra low frequency music being played so loudly by the younger generation . I would recommend this to those who remember when music was music and you could understand the words .
 extremely happy with CD got the 2ndCD to go with this one and it is my kind of music . just a awesome CD to have
 I bought this CD with my eyes wide open . That is to say I knew what I was getting except for the last 11 tracks on the playlist . The main reason for this purchase was that one of my all time favorite songs , `` Kiss Me Goodbye '' by Petula Clark was included along with some standard `` oldies '' fare . I am not entirely familiar with what criteria goes into selecting each track included in a compilation but I assure you that there were not `` 20 Great Love Songs of the 50 's and 60 's '' as the album label states . I have collected quite a few compilations and understand that they ca n't all be hit tunes and you have to expect some side B stuff . But in this case they did n't go into the archives for 11 of the tracks - they must have gone into the catacombs . I have never heard any of the last 11 songs -LRB- except for Bobby 's Girl -RRB- until I listened to this CD . The songs are definitely late 50 's and early 60 's but seem to be a blend of lyrics that reminds one of Frank Zappa 's `` Ruben & the Jets '' album or something out of a Jersey Boys cum Forever Plaid mixed in with the musical `` Bye-bye Birdy '' . I guess that 's OK if you have an affinity for Doo Wop and the borderline hokie . All-in-all I 'm satisfied with this CD even though I only know the words to nine of the songs .
 I bought this cd at a very good price , but I would have paid more for this cd . Look at the songs on it , listen to them in your mind , and you will feel romance . Petula Clark recorded more than Downtown , Dion , he 's a lover , Don & Juan want to know your name , and Cathy Young 's voice is still innocent .
 You can never go wrong with three 6 , and this cd is awesome . The chopped and screwed are my favorites , ive got plenty of these and this is my favorite . I 'd recommend buying
 It 's a shame these guys decided to hang it up , as I 'm an old new waver who loves this stuff . These guys were from Germany and should n't be confused with the American hard rock outfit.There 's NOT a bad song on this disc , but the standout tracks are the 2 they did as maxi-CD singles -LRB- well worth searching for , really -RRB-
 ... This music is great ! I do n't really like most new synthpop bands but these guys do a great job . Great production , solid song writing , great vocalist . I saw them live and bought their CD on the spot . I highly recommend this CD if you want some up beat but no cheesy synthpop ...
 How many `` all-girl '' rock bands can really rock as hard as their male counterparts , especially when those counterparts include bands like Motorhead , Diamond Head , and Saxon ? Only one - Girlschool . Forget about lace , this band is all leather and steel . They 're one of the more important , yet somehow still overlooked bands from the New Wave of British Heavy Metal -LRB- NWOBHM -RRB- scene , and have been delivering hard-hitting , kick in the teeth , rock & roll since the early 80 's . Castle 's 1995 compilation titled simply `` The Collection '' is about as comprehensive an overview of Girlschool 's career as you are likely to find . It features a whopping 47 tracks collected on 2 discs , and covers the band 's entire output . In addition to songs from various Girlschool studio albums , the Collection includes b-sides , live tracks , covers -LRB- of ZZ Top , the Sweet , and T-Rex among others -RRB- , and collaborations such as the St. Valentine 's Day Massacre material the band recorded with Motorhead . The material has been digitally remastered , so it sounds better than ever . You also get a nice booklet with all sorts of band info and photos . Castle is the best in the business when it comes to high quality NWOBHM collections , and they definitely got this one right.If you 're new to Girlschool , the Collection is the perfect way to get acquainted with this classic hard rock band .
 Since alot of Girlschool 's early albums are so hard to find this collection is a real godsend.The song selection is good -LRB- i have a few quibbles about songs that should have been included but that 's life -RRB- and there 's some really good live tracks as well.The liner notes are somewhat dissapointing , they do n't tell you who is playing on the songs or which album they are taken from but there are alot of photos of the band 's various incarnations.If you 're into aggresive guitar driven punk/metal then this is a must have .
 If you like 80 's British Metal you are sure to like Girlschool . This cd has alot of material , it is well produced and the packaging is very cool . It 's a good price for a 2cd set . I nabbed one , and I love it . Most of their early stuff is out of print . They are harder than the Runaways - good catchy riffs , heavily influenced ny Motorhead . Good Metal !!
 rockin ' out again in ND ! cd in great shape-bought used . this brought back so many great memories of college . would recommend for anyone who loves british metal music .
 This compilation set is well worth the asking price because it shows just what a buncha old British broads can do . Great music .
 Too often when talking about girl bands - its ' A good rock band , for a bunch girls ' . This is one of the few female bands that can stand comparison to any band .
 M2M 2ND SINGLE FROM THE NEW ALBUM `` SHADES OF PURPLE '' IS WAY BETTER THEN THE FIRST SINGLE `` DO N'T SAY YOU LOVE ME '' . `` DO N'T SAY . . '' WAS KINDA OF WEIRD.BUT THIS ONE SHOWS THAT THEY DO HAVE GREAT VOICES .
 After listening to `` Do n't Say You Love Me , '' M2M 's first single , I found myself amazed at the talent that these two girls posses . The song has a lot of meaning to it than anything that Backstreet Boys or Nobody 's Angel has ever sung . Their second single , `` Mirror Mirror , '' was n't written buy the duo , but it shows the emotion they can put into a song that they did n't even write . These two girls have found their way into my heart and my CD player . I almost ca n't wait until I buy their CD , `` Shades of Purple . '' Included in this single is also an acoustic version of `` Do n't Say You Love Me '' which comes to show that these girls do n't need synethsizers to make music .
 In my opinion , M2M is the best of all the teen pop acts . Mirror , Mirror shows this off well . Their voices soar over the music and the lyrics have ache and meaning . I really wish they would get more attention here . The acoustic version of Do n't Say You Love Me is the real reason to get this single , proving they do n't need manufactured gimmicks to produce great music and harmonies . Get this single for the acoustic Do n't Say You Love Me , then get Shades of Purple . It 's chock full of great songs from the duo , including the singles -LRB- of course -RRB- .
 I love this single i got it for my birthday and i can listen to it all day long and that is saying something cause usually after awhile a CD with only 2 songs on it would get annoying but since i got it for my birthday i have practically played it 24/7 and it has n't gotten annoying yet !
 this cd shows that you do n't have to have tracks in the back of your music and you don ' have to have to studio make you sound good.i really like mirror mirror.and `` do n't say you love me '' shows that there better singers than you can imagine.i honestly think they sing cause they like it not for the money like most singers and groups .
 dear listeners . This is a different sound for pop & you have to admit the new sound is nice . Infact they have the same baby voice as my band `` Wings '' . Respect them for thier music . I think mirrior mirrior is an awesome song & should have more credit given to it than it gets . I rate this a 5 !
 I think this CD is the best CD I 've ever listened to ! Especially Mirror Mirror . I love the piano playing ! I 'm a piano player , so I should know .
 I have `` Shades of Purple '' and `` The Big Room '' - but bought the single the other day , because it was a really good deal . Mirror Mirror is the first song , and it 's great . THe words are beautiful , and I love the guitar in it!THe next song is `` Do n't Say You Love Me '' and I must say , the acoustic version is much better than the normal one . I like the words more -LRB- a few lines were changed -RRB- and they sound much better vocally . I love the guitar in this one too!Even if you already own The Big Room and/or Shades of Purple , I highly reccommend buying this ! It 's very good!Overall Grade - A +
 I love this CD !! Those who say thier voices are kiddiesh , probably sound kiddeish themselves . M2M shows that no matter how old you are you can still be good at something . The accoustics on `` Do n't say you love me '' are really cool . It makes me want to play the guitar ... people , do n't say it sounds kiddiesh because you did at one time also .
 Their first single was SUPER and this single is SUPER also !!! This is a really good love song !! If you like love songs then this is the cd for you !!!
 M2M 2ND SINGLE `` MIRROR MIRROR '' IS BETTER THEN THE LAST.THIS CD SINGLE HAS ALBUM VERISON OF `` MIRROR MIRROR '' AND AN GUITAR VERISON OF THE LAST SINGLE `` DO N'T SAY YOU LOVE ME . '' M2M IS THE NEXT BIG THING .
 I heard they wrote their own lyrics if they wrote this there pure guiness !
 Everyone , You should get your cd . It rox the world . It 's lively . And you wo n't regret it . I have n't heard Mirror , Mirror -LRB- song -RRB- and I loved it . It is a awesome cd . Buy it now .
 Mirror Mirror has become one of my favorite songs ! It is very well written and performed ! M2M have turned out another suprise hit which is incredibly good ! Buy this !
 Mirror Mirror is a cool follow-up ` er to `` Do n't say you love me '' !
 i think these to songs are graet
 This cd single is GREAT ! I love to listen to both of the songs over and over again . This is one CD you must take advantage of . It has a different beat than most are used to on `` Do n't Say You Love Me '' and also a bit stranger than when heard on the radio . M2M is a new pop band from Norway that are a bit bubble-gum ish , but you will never get tired of them !
 this cd shows that you do n't have to have tracks in the back of your music and you do n't have to have to studio make you sound good.i really like mirror mirror.and `` do n't say you love me '' shows that there better singers than you can imagine.i honestly think they sing cause they like it not for the money like most singers and groups .
 Definately worth a try ! Calling all Bangles fans ! Another group showing girls can do whatever boys do . M2M is definately the bomb !
 Great album , and tastefull mixture of Jazz and Electronica -LRB- House , Ambient , etc. -RRB- Bugge incorporates a traditional Jazz trio -LRB- piano , upright bass & drums -RRB- with Synths , Hammond Organ , Samplers & Loops . No mistake about it , this is Nu-Jazz at his best.Jazz chords and beautifull melodies over Danceable Grooves and tasty Synth work . He 's one of the premier jazzman from Norway , he 's played with Terje Rypdal and Jan Garbarek . If you like Jazz with Grooves and nice Textures , you wo n't be disapointed . Smooth yet Groovy !
 On a recent trip to Norway , I bought Bugge Wesseltoft 's `` New Conception of Jazz '' album after reading about the new exciting things going on in Norwegian jazz in the New York Times.I really got into that album and purchased `` Sharing '' from Amazon shortly after.I 'm not sure which album I like better , but I think it 's fair to describe `` Sharing '' as a more subtle , more layered album . That may mean it is less engaging or catchy , or it may mean it is deeper - depending on your tastes.Whether Wesseltoft 's music is really an entirely new conception of jazz or not is debatable , but I like what he does with it , and I think you will too if you are just feeling your way around jazz as a beginner . You do n't need to be a huge jazz fan to like this stuff , as long as you are into somewhat experimental stuff . The use of electric instruments and programming along with more traditional jazz sounds really defines the music and gives it its character . But Wesseltoft is not all style - there is good songwriting going on here . `` Existence '' has a hauntingly played piano melody which repeats itself throughout the track in a consistent yet never tiring manner . Sidsel Endresen delivers a sensitive vocal performance on `` You Might Say , '' one of the more `` conventional '' songs on the album , which becomes more interesting with repeated listenings.If you are new to Bugge Wesseltoft , start with `` New Conception of Jazz '' - if you have it , dive in deeper with `` Sharing . ''
 The Japanese trio Buffalo Daughter takes music and turns it inside out in `` Pshychic , '' their latest remix EP . Their unique blend of electronica , art-rock and electronic kaboom proves that while this band is not straying too far from their musical origins , they 're still expanding.It kicks off with `` Cyclic , '' with its woven guitars and organs , following with the chaotically brilliant `` Chihuahua Punk , '' the vibrant `` Pshychic a Go-Go '' and the relatively ordinary `` S.O.I.D. '' But Buffalo Daughter 's true test is the grand finale
 This is a great EP from the experimental electro-rockers Buffalo Daughter . The music is unpredictable , hypnotic and just a whole lot of all around goodness . Most of the tracks are long , meandering and downtempo . If you like `` I '' , you will not be dissapointed with this release .
 i spent 40 bucks on this cd just because it is buffalo daughter , and it was worth every last penny.its alot like the album `` I '' , and more enlightening.the lyrics are very elevating and will take you places you never knew existed . i highly recommend buying this cd , even if you have to sell some old ones , you will not be disappointed
 This is a great CD , if you like &#34; I &#34; then you will like this one also . I look forward to getting some more Buffalo Daughter .
 I do n't know what the other reviewers were listening to . But , this is far and above Buffalo Daughter 's masterpiece ! It is not a remix EP but a full fledged album . There is one song which is a remake of a track from their first CD , Captain Vapour Athletes , 303live . But this version is 20 minutes long ! I went on a crash course of BD after seeing that they were on the bill at the recent Big in Japan show at the Hollywood Bowl with Yellow Magic Orchestra , Cibo Matto , and Towa Tei . As I was fans of those artists but was unable to attend , I figured I must give these guys a listen . They are a trio of two girls and one guy and play electronic rock . This title was the last disc of 5 to arrive . I found out that I could n't get past the first two tracks . I played them over and over and over again . This is the best Prog album I 've heard in decades . The first track , Cyclic , has elements of Yes meets Led Zeppelin meets YMO . The 2nd track , Pshychic A Go Go -LRB- my favorite -RRB- , totally knocked my socks off ! I heard Heldon -LRB- the french electronic band with Richard Pinhas -RRB- and CAN . It really builds and rocks ! After multiple plays , I realized I still get to discover the rest of the CD . I love Chihuahua Punk for it 's whimsey and S.O.I.D. reminds me of the Krautrock bands Harmonia or Neu . The last track takes you to places you never expect it to go . It begins with a bunch of bleeps and boops and eventually turns into Kraftwerk meets Tangerine Dream meets Heldon meets everything I love about Prog Rock . This CD will blow you away if you are any fan of the aforementioned artists as well as loving Nippon Rock . Only the title track of New Rock comes close to this . BUY IT NOW !!! Socks , Drugs , and Rock and Roll indeed .
 Not a bad buy for the price . I 'm a great 007 fan , and enjoyed this disc a great deal . Most of the songs are original , but some are n't . If you 're a Bond fan , I strongly reccomend this CD .
 I have stopped trying to make sense out of BMG 's marketing strategy for Elvis ' impressive catalog of music , otherwise I would be driving myself crazy wondering why they released this 2 CD set of Elvis movie songs less than a year after releasing a single CD of Elvis movie songs with many of the same songs !?! Not being a record company executive , I guess I will never understand the logic behind that.Regardless , this is an excellent collection of Elvis movie songs and is probably the best one currently available . It contains many songs that were hits ; in fact it includes far more hits than most other artists ' greatest hits collections ! It includes three songs that went all the way to number 1 on the Billboard singles chart -LRB- Love Me Tender , Jailhouse Rock , and Hard Headed Woman -RRB- , two other songs that just missed hitting the top spot peaking at number 2 -LRB- Ca n't Help Falling in Love and Return to Sender -RRB- and the top 10 single Bossa Nova Baby . 16 other songs made the Top 40 and 6 more made the Top 100 chart . It only includes a few songs that probably made Elvis wince when he recorded them -LRB- while the songs Elvis was given for his movie soundtracks were not always the best , his performances were -RRB- . The first CD is the strongest , but the second CD has some highlights . It includes Elvis ' underappreciated country-rock classic Clean Up Your Own Back Yard plus the original versions of Little Less Conversation and Rubberneckin ' , which were remixed and became hits a few years ago . All-in-all this is a very strong collection and highly recommended if you do not already own most of these songs on one of the numerous other collections of Elvis movie songs .

 Thirty years since Elvis has retired and it amazes me how I continue to discover songs that are great ! Although he was a great actor , a lot of his movies were bad . Having said that , his movie music was great . The first disc is a lot of what you still hear on the radio . The second disc is more so music you would not of herd unless you watched all his movies . What a treat ! The best part is the music has been remastered and sounds fantastic . You have to remember that some of these songs are 40 plus years old . Once you recieve this CD in the mail , you will not `` Return to Sender '' .
 After a coworker bought this and rated it highly , I decided to take the plunge and get this . What a treat !! I 've been a huge fan of Elvis for years but I ca n't say I wanted to buy an album of this . I downloaded his No. 1 's Collection , but I really did n't think I needed anything else . But one glance at this collection , and you realize this is something special.Here are a few unique things about this collection :1 . A Huge Number of Songs
 THERE IS NOTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT THIS EXCELLENT COLLECTION OF SONGS , NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES THEY HAVE BEEN RELEASED BEFORE.THE SONGS HAVE STOOD THE TEST OF TIME AND ARE CLASSIC PERFORMANCES BY THE MOST CLASSIC ENTERTAINER OF ANY GENRE OF ALL TIME.IF YOU DO NOT ALREADY HAVE A COLLECTION OF THESE SONGS I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU PURCHASE THIS SET AND ENJOY THE FEEL GOOD MUSIC.THERE IS ONLY ONE ELVIS .
 Well , I ca n't say that this collection holds any hidden secrets because it does not . In fact , if you are a die-hard Elvis fan , you probably carry much of the content of this set with you in the car . -LRB- Especially on disc one . -RRB- I think most of the `` fun '' tracks are on disc two.My favorites are `` Little Egypt , '' `` Clambake '' , `` Shake That Tambourine , '' and most notibly , `` Long Legged Girl With The Short Dress On . '' Do n't get me wrong , I like many of the songs . What is nice about this collection is that you get a neat variety packaged in one easy to carry set.I will have to agree with the person who was complaining about the so-called REMASTERING . Case in point ; `` Long Legged Girl '' is one of my favorite Elvis songs of all time . So much so that I recorded my own version in my home studio . I based my recording on an original copy of the 45 record . That version is SMOKIN ' HOT ! In the beginning of the song , the electric guitar jumps out of the speakers and smacks you right in the face ! In this collection `` Long Legged Girl '' sounds very `` tepid '' to say the least . The guitars are held back , you can barely hear the horn section , and the dynamic levels are the same through the entire song.I was very inclined to rate this as a three star collection rather than a four . I changed my mind at the last second basically because of the variety of tracks included in the set .
 This is THE cd I have been looking for for a long time ! I thought the cd was gone for good until Ihappened upon it at Amazon . The cassette I had years ago does n't have near the songs that the cd does . Thank you , Amazon for making my search , finally , a dream come true . Lisa Lyons , a very satisfied customer .
 South Sea Island Magic will transport you to the Islands . Moe 's romantic voice will make you as high as `` Scotch and Soda , '' one of the offerings of this album . We boarded our ship in Honolulu and joined our o'hana for drinks . Moe Keale walked into the lounge and sat with his wife and friends . I leaned across to my husband and said , `` That 's Moe Keale , you should hear him play ukelele . '' About that time , Moe leaned over and picked up his uke and started playing with a group of ladies sitting at a nearby table . I was thrilled , another young lady got up and began to hula . Moe moved back to his table and then got up and walked over to our table . He asked if he could sit down . My husband said , `` Please do . '' Moe sat , he talked with us a little while and then asked , `` Do you mind if I ask about your face ? '' -LRB- Because of a brain clot I have some facial paralysis -RRB- He then said , '' You must have been a very beautiful woman , because you are still a very beautiful woman . '' I 've been dancing to his album ever since especially to `` Hale'iwa Hula , '' one of my favorites on this album . South Sea Island Magic , you 'll hear it in his voice . Listen with someone you love , or be careful , you might fall in love . This album really has South Sea Island Magic !
 great music , great manthe album as pictured above is turned on its side

 Live Honey 's Move Yourself cd is a fresh new spin on the music scene . Once you listen to it a few times , you get addicted ! This is not a three chord band . There is definite talent here . But you have to turn it up loud ! `` Cinnamon Smile '' is the song that drew me to it . `` Once in a While '' also has me hooked . Just give it a shot . Shelly 's voice will keep you coming back for more .
 The amazing lead vocals , of a friend and fellow performer , Shelly Bushan push this album over the top . Visit the site , and buy the CD . She - and the band - have the spunk of No Doubt , with just enough jazzy soul to kick their own groove . They rock
 I saw this band live in CT and I feel in love with their original style and Shelly 's vocals . Awesome CD that I would recommend to anyone . Definately feel good music .
 This band rocks !!!!!!!! Great lyrics and rythms that keep you on the edge of your seat . The lead singer can sing her tail off!Turn up the volume and enjoy this wonderful CD .
 It 's one of those essential CD 's you take when you go on a long drive by yourself . I really like listening to Let Me Grow and Once in a While . Their music is distinctive and original .
 I 'm always looking for great bands with a new sound . These guys ROCK . The leader singer is incredible . When I heard she went to school at The University of Texas I fell in love with her voice .
 Supreme vocals and lyrics . Lookout for these guys - they are the real deal . `` Cinnamon Smile '' is definitely radio breaking material .

 This guy is killer . If there is a better blues harmonica active I 'd love to hear about them . Do n't know how old he is , but his voice is in great shape and he 's a ball of fire . The blues is great party music and this is a perfect Saturday night album . Snooky rocks . Enjoy !
 It 's this simple ; If you have any soul , you 'll like this CD
 this is another great outing by snooky ! this was studio-recorded in the 90s in chicago , and everyone involved seems to be having a great time ! it opens with just snooky and his harmonica on the title tune , and moves to full blues band 12 bar glory . snooky blows some great fat harp on mostly standards -LRB- `` work with me annie , '' `` pistol packin ' mama , '' `` tomorrow night '' and `` someday baby '' among others -RRB- but he put his own stamp on each one as only he could do . billy flynn on guitar lays down some very tasty licks throughout , and bassist rober stroger and drummer jimmy tilman put down a consistent beat and bottom . but ultimately , the show belongs to snooky.i think my favorite songs on this album are the slow blues , `` telephone blues '' and `` headed south . '' both songs give snooky some room to stretch out and blow his horn.snooky used to come out to yoshi 's in oakland , california a couple times a year in the 90s and early 00s with jimmy rogers , pinetop perkins , junior wells and other chicago blues legends . they 're all mostly gone now , but i 'll always have this indelible image in my head of snooky pryor blowing away on his harmonica at the mike , looking at me with his big bloodshot eyes .
 Title song is a great tune
 This is a great soundtrck it 's fun and enjoyable to listen to . the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
 This is essentially New Age Music , but with a difference
 Doc Childre composed this music as part of his work in helping people to access their heart intelligence in times of stress or emotional disturbance . It is also designed to help counteract fatigue and access intuitive intelligence . Much of New Age music is relaxing , but this music is relaxing and energizing at the same time . I find it delivers on the above promises , especially when combined with simple exercises devised by Doc Childre . This album is beautiful listening music with a variety of tempos and styles .

 I ca n't believe that I had to import this CD from Canada , but I 'm so glad that I did !! I heard about Spek through Kinnie Starr 's website -LRB- She helps out on `` Look Me Up '' -RRB- . This CD is awesome - no other words can discribe it . His music 's both energetic and soothing . Great voice and whoever his back-up singer is ... well , she rocks . Lookin forward to seeing him live !! I 'll go all the way to Canada if I have to !!!!
 This Cd is a brilliant collection of R/B , and Hip hop tunes , they really spoke out to me , since im not even into that genre of Music , The lead single ` Smell the Coffee ' , urged me to buy the CD , and the follow-up single ` Im a Hippie ' , made me go out and actually get it immediately , and this was not a mistake , every song is equally as good or better , some of my Other favorites would be ` Moving To NYC ' , and ` Freaks me Out ` The Cd Dose n't do him justice either , just wait till you see his Live shows , thats where the real talent is at , Basically though , i urge you to buy this CD , it 'll be a great new CD for your collection , you wo n't regret it , i know i have n't
 As far as the music goes on HAI ! well , I LIKE it ... no , I love it . But I love Siouxsie , so anything that she offers is good enough for me . That being said , if you have all of the Creatures CD 's then you 'll also want this . The drums are wild , the vocals are amazing . But the lyrics are somewhat silly and inconsequential.The second `` CD '' in this Limited Edition IMPORT is not a CD at all -LRB- at least I ca n't play it as a CD -RRB- . Instead it is a DVD with 4 `` tracks '' of Budgie & Leonard Eto drumming and a VERY brief appearance by Siouxsie sitting in a chair -LRB- saying nothing -RRB- . The DVD also includes a video for The Creatures ' 2ND FLOOR -LRB- from Anima Animus -RRB- . Really bad marketing copy on this CD/DVD set , Amazon ... I got it as a gift or I might not have purchased it at all . Overall , I 'm a hardcore Siouxsie fan , and this 2 set is for hardcore fans . If you 're a `` newbie '' you 'll be satisfied with the regular edition . Either way , get some form of HAI ! You wo n't be disappointed .
 I love this CD - its different than any other Creatures or Siouxsie and the Banshees CD . The Japanese drums are awesome ! I actually went to the concert this year -LRB- An Evening with Siouxsie -RRB- where they performed some of the songs from this CD . Oh yeah - I brought a friend who has NEVER seen Siouxsie before and now she 's a fan too -LRB- never too late to become a Siouxsie fan -RRB- . I highly recommend this CD .
 I recently got this version of the album -LRB- disc one -- full album , disc two -- instrumental version minus ` Godzilla ! ' -RRB- . Of course the album is brilliant , but the second disc is a revelation -- with a minimum of Siouxsie 's vocals , it 's perfect mood music for an evening home alone .
 Eurasia 's most inspired duo.Flashbacks envelope a bullet to the future.Not for the faint of heart .
 The Sex Pistols started punk , and this cd is their best , all their great songs remastered to sound better , one of the best albums , of ... well ever .
 Forget `` respect for the guys who launched it '' -LRB- and trust me , they did ; more in a second on that -RRB- -- go buy this because it is a fantastic record with the essential studio tracks and some good live recordings . Play `` Anarchy '' once , and there 's no going back.Turn up `` Prety Vacant '' to ten and feel everything punk was , and should still be.Although Iggy Pop helped lay a framework , and even Alice Cooper -LSB- the band -RSB- used outrage as part of its appeal , The Ramones first album is , IMHO , the first punk record . And almost NO ONE would ever have heard it if not for their progeny . The Sex Pistols were so explosive in England , and so good , that British TV and newspapers were fascinated by them . And American TV took note , as did popular music magazines . And punk * was * the Sex Pistols -- the music and Johnny Rotten were angry , and were expressing in raw terms what they felt . And the songs on this record are a fantastic way to enter the world of the Pistols ' music .
 If you like punk and dont own this album , theres something wrong . The Sex Pistols started the whole thing so show some respect and get a copy !
 For anyone who has preconceptions about the limitations or range of the ukulele -LRB- and who has n't -RRB- , prepare to be enlightened ! In his first -LRB- to my knowledge -RRB- CD release , Dan -LRB- Soybean -RRB- Sawyer takes the once-thought-humble four-stringed instrument through such a wide range of musical styles , from a kind of Celtic ukulele-Bluegrass -LRB- `` Fleas in the Grass '' -RRB- , to a VERY funky -LRB- and I mean that in a good way -RRB- rendition of `` Comin ' Home Baby '' , in which he really takes his uke through the paces , and completely confounds any presuppositions about the instrument 's scope or boundaries . What is truly remarkable about this CD , -LRB- in addition to Dan 's undeniable chops as a player -RRB- , is his breadth as an arranger . From the light-footed Dixieland-style `` Sheik of Araby '' , through waltz , blues , rag , noir , to a ghostly rendition of `` Wreck of the Sloop John B. '' , It 's clear that Dan is n't easily confined by genre , nor does he take himself too seriously to stop him from seasoning the mix with hints of a musical sense of humor sprinkled tastefully throughout . It 's to the ukulele 's credit that Mr. Sawyer , an accomplished guitar player , has chosen this diminutive , but surprisingly dynamic and versatile instrument for his inaugural CD release . Uke of Ages immediately became not just my favorite ukulele CD , but one of my most-played CD 's , period . Here 's hoping there 's plenty more where this came from !
 Over the years I have listened to many ukulele recordings , many of which have been very good , some of which have been - to say the least - dire , but none of which have been of a truly top quality professional standard , until now.From the first track it becomes quickly apparent that Dan Sawyer is a truly talented professional musician , and as the CD progresses he cleverly uses his skills to provide the listener with not only a tremendously varied selection of tracks of the highest quality , but also musicianship of the highest order . He takes ukulele playing to another level with apparent ease , both to himself by his beautifully smooth but technically advanced playing , and to the listener - who is left thirsting for more!A fabulous CD , and one which will raise the profile of this talented musician within the world of professional music as well as within the world of fans the ukulele .
 Dan Sawyer 's Uke Of Ages is a beautifully conceived , arranged and performed collection of eclectic songs for this unique instrument . The selections , of various styles , have kept me entertained over and over . The swinging Sheik , the grooving Sloop John B , Coming Home , the lyrical When You Wish Upon A Star , and his fine vocal style make this a winner for me ! It 's a one-of-a-kind . Five stars !
 Mr. Sawyer is an extremely talented jazz guitarist and composer who has performed on everything from albums by Barbara Streisand , to conducting the `` Name That Tune '' orchestra , and composing for various TV programs and cartoons . Now he directs his immense talents to playing an instrument that many will laugh at when you mention it , the ukulele . But this CD is no laughing matter . You will be amazed at the sounds that `` Soybean '' gets out of 4 strings . You may feel like the audience in his tune `` It?s Uke Time '' who laugh until they hear the music this wonderful little instrument can make in the hands of a gifted musician like Mr. Sawyer . Many styles of music are demonstrated , from a reggaesque `` Wreck of the Sloop John B '' to blues and even Bluegrass on the original `` Fleas in the Grass '' . His cover tunes are outstanding , but he really shows his musical ability on his originals such as `` Whoopsi Daisy '' and `` Duet for One '' . His voice , on the 2 tunes he sings on , has a James Taylor quality to it . Whatever preconceived notion you may have about the ukulele will be obliterated when you hear this CD . The ukulele -LRB- and Mr. Sawyer -RRB- is not to be laughed at , but enjoyed completely and marveled at . Do yourself a favor and buy it !
 If the word on the street that the ukulele is `` back '' is true , then this CD certainly proves it . Dan Sawyer 's been on the live uke circuit for a while and I 'm glad that he 's finally packaged this group of mostly instrumentals for easier consumption . And an eclectic group , indeed ! His chops are supported by his love for the uke as he showcases his `` tiny wonder '' in varying types of music . The banjo flair on `` Fleas in the Grass '' , the groovy blues of `` Ca n't Refuse '' and the melancholy `` Uke Noir '' all confirm the versatility of the instrument . DS keeps the songs simple and the playing fun , inviting you to jam right along . But the highlight for me is `` It 's Uke Time ! '' where he lends his friendly voice to a swinging romp of a tune and completes the overall feel of the album in this celebration of the ukulele .
 Having read the other reviews , the only thing I can add is that this musician is way above any pigeon holing . He is comfortable in any genre . I normally do n't care for country or bluegrass , but Sawyer 's stuff is just so much fun . It 's obvious that he is really enjoying making the music . The uke can do anything it 's bigger cousin , the guitar , can do with the right hands guiding it . Please , if you love life enhancing and joyous music , buy this CD . Mr Sawyer , when will the next uke CD be out ? I want it .
 This album is Ralph Stanley II 's second title album . He really brings a fresh and distinct sound to several Stanley classics with this album . All of the instrumental and background vocals provided sometimes by Ralph Stanley and all of the Clinch Mountain Boys is exceptional . The title track `` Pretty Girls , City Lights '' is awesome with the legend his dad doing the tenor vocals on the song . The whole album just screams and pays tribute to the wonderful and unique Stanley sound.Some of my favorites are `` Home In The Mountains '' which really highlights the Stanley II rich baritone vocals , so does `` I 'll Remember You In My Dreams . '' Also `` Think of What You 've Done '' is a great Stanley Brothers classic . `` Pathway of Danger '' is a beautifully written song , which have some excellent background vocals . I am so glad that `` Sea of Regret '' and `` All I Ever Loved Was You '' are included on this album , songs you find a lot on Ralph Stanley albums with Ricky Skaggs and Keith Whitley.I will conclude by simply saying this a pure , traditional , and exceptional well recorded bluegrass album that really allows for the voice of Ralph Stanley II to shine . This is awesome and authentic music , you will love it .
 As a fan of Ralph , this is next best to him It is a great cd and I am enjoying the music very much I like both father and son music Pretty Girls City Lights is wonderful if you do n't have it I suggest you purchase one
 Ralph Stanley II really has a lot to look forward to . This new album is nothing but great . Every song is wonderful , and I guarantee this one will not come out of your cd player for a long time , it 's that good . Pathway of Danger is my personal favorite .
 It 's does n't make sense that this is from 1999 . This little known project was looking very far ahead , and seems like it must have been sent back in time from ten years in it 's own future .

 This Cd is different from the other releases that Sawyer Brown has put out in the past . This album is full of alot of great vocals from Mark as well as the rest of the band . I feel that this album might not win alot of awards but this album shows Sawyer Brown fans as well as country music fans that their is alot more to Sawyer Brown -LRB- their vocal abilities -RRB- than just their typical Country Dance music that they have released in the past . I am very glad to say that I very much enjoy this CD . Sincerely Tammy From Florida . .
 this is a great album !! the band is sooo hot the best song is drive me wild
 This CD is awesome . I have really enjoyed listening to it . It may be the best CD they have recorded . There are excellent vocals and a great mixture of songs , upbeat ones as well as slower songs with lots of meaning . I ca n't stop listening to it , you got ta have it !!!!!!!!!!
 I love Sawyer Brown . It 's the best cd they have out
 Once again Sawyer Brown kicks . With all of the controversy about whether or not something is or is not country , they just keep on cranking out the cream of the crop . We do n't care if radio does n't like it , we love it and will continue to buy it . Do not ever stop , because it drives us crazy !
 With every new release these guys proove that they 've got what it takes . I definitely recommend this CD to anyone who likes a variety of music from heartfelt ballads to pulse pounding feet stomping good time music !! Way to go Guys !!
 I absolutely love sawyer brown . Just the fact that they have a certain twang that no one else has or can do . NO ONE can dance like Mark Miller either .
 I really like the way mark moves on stage.He really got the moves for all of his songs .
 Whoever Allana Nash is , I guess that she goes more for the `` artistes '' that tend to break up over artistic differences and are never heard from again , and not the talented bands that prove that they have staying power ! Sawyer Brown , who have won numerous fan voted and industry awards , have a WINNER with `` Drive Me Wild '' . My personal favorites in this collection are the title cut , `` I 'm In Love With Her '' -LRB- beautiful ! -RRB- , and `` All Wound Up '' . I have followed and been friends with these guys for 15 years , and if Mark Miller sings in a `` smarmy , big boy '' way , he can sing that way for this ol' girl ANY TIME ! `` Mediocre '' ? Puh-leeze !
 When I bought this CD I did ` nt know too much about Sawyer . I saw him on the Grand Ole Opry and I said I had to buy this CD . It 's probably one of the best choices for a CD that I ever made . The hard driven lyrics are great and it does ` nt even sound that much country at all . My favorite song is Moon over Miami . If you buy this CD now , I promise you , that you will never regret it . Keep up the good work Sawyer Brown !
 I recommend this CD to anyone , country music fan or not . You wo n't be disappointed . Drive Me Wild is one of my favorite songs of all time . I also like It All Comes Down to Love , which Sawyer Brown dedicated to the Columbine students at the TNN Country Awards show this past June .
 I have never been a huge fan of Sawyer Brown but liked some of their songs . I bought this CD because I really like `` Drive Me Wild '' and after listening to the whole CD a few times I was amazed my how good all of the songs are . My favorites are `` Moon Over Miami '' , `` 800 Pound Jesus '' , `` It All Comes Down To Love '' and `` We 're Everything To Me '' . It is obvious that this group spent considerable time creating this album with the excellent writing , producing and singing . I have about 5 Sawyer Brown CDs and this is my favorite . Highly recommended for any country music fan .
 I bought this about 2-3 years ago assuming it had a few songs worth listening to . EVERY SINGLE TRACK is worth listening to . I love 800 lb . Jesus , Drive Me Wild , and Soul Searching best . I can relate to all of these songs .
 this album is a great one , for any music fan weather you like rock , country , easy listening , i am a fan of Dr.Dre and Eminem and i like this album.the songs are all great.THE BEST CUTS ARE .1 . Every little thing2.Drive Me Wild3.Moon over miami4.Break My Heart again5 .800 pound jesus5 + + +
 THIS IS A GREAT CD you dont even have to like country music to like this , i am 17 and a backstreet boy fan and i like it.the best songs on the cd areDRIVE ME WILD , BREAK MY HEART AGAIN ,800 POUND JESUS , MOON OVER MIAMI , PLAYIN A LOVE SONGBUY THIS CD
 I 've heard Sawyer Brown sing for years but I 've never really listened to him , until the video 800 pound Jesus . He has an incredible voice . This CD has been in someone 's player ever since I bought it . The whole family has really enjoyed it . This was my first Sawyer Brown CD , but not my last .
 I have n't been a big Sawyer Brown fan , until now . This is a great album . Thanks to Crystal for getting me to listen to this album .
 I do n't know how they do it , but Sawyer Brown seems to just get better as they go along . . this album is fantastic , the sound is amazing and the vocals are dynamo ! I recommend ` Drive ME Wild ' to everyone , even if you 're not a big country music enthusiast , this album is wonderful ! It gets into your head , only not annoyingly so ... :-RRB- Congrats to Mark & the boys , it rocks & rolls ... : -RRB-
 this Cd was recomended to me by my best friend and I will recomend it to anyone else ! I can understand why the receivers were voted number one in a bay area servey !
 I have been to a lot of their concerts and i am really addicted to them . Their cd is my fav and alll of my friends love it to . I can understand why they were voted number one in a bay area servey . The Recievers rock !
 The sound on these tranfers is full and clear , rather better than what one might expect on other labels such as Naxos , which tends to be over-bright and thin in the bass . My memories of the 78 rpm set of the Fourth Symphony tell me that this is a pretty faithful-sounding transfer , certainly much better than the synthetic-sounding EMI References set , no longer available . I can imagine , however , that an Opus Kura transfer might be even better , but in the meantime , this set will do.With one exception , these are great renditions . That exception is the First Movement of the First Symphony . it is simply too fast to register any impact ; passages seem to just fly by . Weingartner 's earlier set with the Royal Philharmonic is far more spacious and impactful . I must qualify this reservation by saying that the rest of the Symphony is superb . The other symphonies are wonderfully done ; my personal favorite is the Fourth , which is done in a reserved , autumnal style that emphasizes the gravity of the work , rather than its volatility -LRB- Furtwaengler 's is the great example of this latter point of view -RRB- . Highly recommended !
 I have grown leary of buying historic recordings on labels I 'm not familiar with . I 've gotten burned a couple of times , but fortunately it was for minimal cost . And I have found a couple of nice sounding gems . This set would fall somewhere in between , though I would have preferred a little less filtering . I personally will not buy any of Pearl 's transfers from 78 's because of the surface noise , though that does n't bother some people . These are n't like that , but they are n't as good as Dutton or Naxos either -LRB- currently this set is n't available on any of the above mentioned labels -RRB- . But by no means are they like some of those obscure European labels awful transfers that sound like you are under water . I have n't mentioned the material at all , mainly because most people interested in Weingartner know his work and the only question would be sound quality . However , for those who are n't familiar with him , Weingartner does n't monkey around with the score . He finds the perfect tempo and sticks to it , resulting in possibly the closest thing to the composer actually conducting the performance as you will get .
 Ok . I had the cassette version of this compilation and pretty much wore it out . It 's one of those great `` truck stop '' finds that is actually a decent mix of songs from a particular time period . I 'm very happy that this comp was a part of my listening rotation at such an early age because it truly was a musical doorway into a lot of the music I obsess over to this day . That 's all .
 For many of us that came of age in the late 50 's and early 60 's just before the British invasion of the Beatles and Rolling Stones , these were the songs that impacted us on a daily basis.So here its is many years later , and these songs still have meaning to many of us that lived , loved and played in that era . In many ways reflecting on these songs now is hearing a time when the world was right for the most part . Although few of us would have envisoned what the 60 's would eventually bring us.This is the genesis of rock and roll as the baby boomers knew it .
 This is one of the best bbkings concert I ever heard . Takes you into a world of sounds an imagination very high
 August 1972 myself and best friend at the age of 17 whent to Cow Town Ball Room . 2nd row ! this was and still is the best of very many B.B. King concerts I have ever attended and I have attended many good ones . Met Mr. King that night in person shook his hand . therefore this c.d. which no doubt will be what I remember the actual concert to be is a must for my collection . That was 30 years ago and I am now the age B.B. was at that time ! I heard it in person you must listen to it too ! didnt know it even existed
 I could not disagree more with the reviewer who said that `` The Purple Dancer '' is the worst song Danny Kirwan wrote . In point of fact , I think it is the stand-out track of the entire boxed set . The lyrics are dream-like and sort of trippy with striking imagery , and Danny 's guitar work throughout is stellar and breathtaking . Both versions are fantastic , but the longer one with the jam is truly amazing . I 'd give anything to have been at that concert ! In addition , there is `` Open the Door , '' another of Danny 's very poignant songs , beautifully rendered , and `` Down at the Crown , '' a great rocker of Danny 's that can only be found here . On top of all that , there are really great extended , live versions of his `` Station Man '' and `` Tell Me All the Things You Do , '' which must have been fantastic to watch in concert.I definitely could do without Jeremy Spencer 's derivative '50s stuff , and Christine McVie is in irritatingly bad voice on some of the tracks , which is why I was astounded to see that the liner notes portray this set as a sort of `` Christine McVie show . '' These CDs are really at heart all about Danny Kirwan and his remarkable talent , and just as important , his tremendous influence on the direction the Mac took at a critical period in their musical evolution , extending many years into the future of the band .
 I completely disagree with the previous review on this album , especially the part of Purple Dancer being the worst song Kirwan ever wrote . Purple Dancer is one of the most sought after songs of the early FM era , and even though it is not the original release , it 's available only on this set . And maybe it 's not perfect , but this release is solid and raw and it captures fleetwood Mac during the Kiln house tour which was short lived , due to Jeremy Spencer 's dissapearance from the band to join the children of god . Also I would like to add that it is rare to find any fleetwood mac live recordings between the eras of the band that was after the Peter Green days , and Before the Buckingham , Nicks era . So in my opinion if you are a FM fan of all the eras , you will be glad this is available . Let 's just hope it stays available , and maybe there will so some recordings released during the `` Future Games '' or `` Bare Trees '' era .
 Part of this CD was once released on LP as `` Live In Boston , '' however , the whole CD is great . I do not know what this other reviewer is talking about with his terrible sound quality comment , but this CD has great sound quality considering it was recorded around 1967 . Just listen to Green 's playing on `` Green Manalishi , '' `` Only You , '' `` Like It That Way '' and `` Oh Well . '' You can easily pick out his guitar over Spencer and Kirwan . Lots of blues and lots of talent on this CD ! UPDATE
 I have no idea what most of these reviewers are talking about but Fleetwood Mac `` Madison Blues Live '' is a single CD with six songs
 Brent gunter is talented spanish guitarist which will transform and create a magical journey of andalucia to a vivid picture . This album is filled with some rock , and middle easter percussion and some latin ryhthms which accompany the spanish guitar . Brent plays beautiful melodies and maginificant touch on spanish guitar . The songs bella noche and touch are just creative and full of beat and heart of spanish guitar . This album has taken spanish guitar into new groove , rock generation . Brent 's song has mystical touch and essence of spanish guitar which will take u in and never let u go away . Journey of Andalucia is beautiful and magical.I recommend this album to spanish guitar lovers . This album has taken spanish guitar into new generation of popular pop and midle eastern rythms . Buy this album and take the journey of Mystical Andalucia.See my other reviews for other great spanish guitar albums which u will love.Viva Brent .
 If there 's one part of the Tenchi Music that stands out the most , it 's the original scores . A lot of instrumentals are on this one , with one incredible vocal `` Manatsu No Eve '' which was used in the ending credits.It seems that PIONEER has given up on dubbing the music from TENCHI into english , though .
 I got this one by accident but hey I did n't send it back and I listen to it all the time and I had n't even seen the movie ! Now that I have seen the movie and own it I would say this is a must have .
 This soundrack combines chorus , keyboard , instrumentals , and other kinds of music to make a hauntingly beautiful and sometimes dark collection ; all topped off with the romantic theme , Manastu No Eve . This is one of my favorite sountacks , and I recommend it 100 % !
 This Italian production has a lot of overlap with the `` My Russian Homeland '' CD -LRB- tracks 1 , 2 , 6 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 15 , 16 , 17 & 18 -RRB- . It also contains 3 of the better tracks from the `` Crowning of a Great Career '' CD -LRB- tracks 3 , 4 & 5 -RRB- . It also has four tracks that until now were only available on the `` Memories of Russia '' LP -LRB- tracks 8 , 14 , 19 & 20 -RRB- . The last track is `` Natascha '' , which I believe was on the US version of the `` Ivan Rebroff Sings Folk Songs from Old Russia '' LP.These are all good -LRB- or great ! -RRB- tracks , though `` Natascha '' does n't do much for me . The `` My Russian Homeland '' and `` Memories of Russia '' tracks are all among my favorites . All of these tracks are in the original Russian.The CD I have had some technical problems
 I was first introduced to Mr. Rebroff 's singing back in 1989 as a sofomore in high school . My aural training teacher brought her only record of Rebroff singing beautiful Russian folk songs to class and played it for us . I was extremely impressed with the man 's vocal talent and had since wondered where I could locate a Rebroff recording regardless of whether it was in German or Russian . To my dismay , I could not find anything for a long time primarily because his music was all on LP . Now , I am very greatful to have discovered that this CD is available ! To me , the pieces on this recording are a true representative sampling of Mr. Rebroff 's ability . He can sing high , low , and expressively . His voice is very warm and very pleasant to hear . The songs are all performed in Russian . They are popular pieces with some being very pretty ballads . Some of the pieces are fast while others are slow . Mr. Rebroff 's phrasing and diction are fantastic . I often wish I could speak Russian so I could understand the music . However , one not need to speak Russian in order to enjoy this CD . I highly recommend this recording .
 Hamnataing is exuberent with old-timer quality fiddling , soundly rooted in the Shetland tradition of the band members , but infused with the energy and creativity of a young generation . Although Fiddlers ' Bid uses guitar , bass , and piano accompaniments , allowing many styles of musical influnce to tinge their arrangements , the focus is really on the fiddling , which is gorgeous , relentlessly energetic , and joyfull . Well worth listening to for its own sake , this high-energy album is also an inspiring soundtrack for getting things done , from cleaning your apartment to writing your dissertation .
 I am a life long Uriah Heep fan & have been waiting for a live concert dvd to come out . This is it , U are a Heep fan or U would n't be reading this . I thought the song selection was good , the band was tight , I just do n't have any complaints about this dvd . I 'm glad it included Lee Kerslake before he left the band . I would like to see a newer concert though as Lee 's replacement is a great drummer too . I do n't write long reviews so if U are a `` Heepster '' then buy it .
 This concert shows thas the magic of music does not rely on who is playing . If the music is performed by great musicians , it does n't matter if they are 20 or 60 years old . You are sure to be captured and carried away . And this is what happens here . Enjoy my friend , again and again .
 ... . looking for great rock . And , oh boy , did I find it at London 's Astoria!Thijs van Leer 's legendary Focus was a magnificent support act -LRB- Eruption and Hocus Pocus being genuinely stunning -RRB- , keeping the capacity crowd more than happy for 90 minutes . Then the Heepsters took to the stage to thunderous applause . If the tight and powerful renditions of Easy Livin ' and Shadows of Grief warmed up the already ecstatic fans , the absolutely blistering Pilgrim -LRB- a very underrated Heep classic that does n't get enough outings -RRB- totally blew us away ! Mick 's screaming guitar , Bernie 's wild vocals and Lee 's military-marching rhythms coming together perfectly in an absolutely unmissable performance that sent shivers down your spine . The gutsy , hard-edged Bad Bad Man and Devil 's Daughter kept the adrenaline going in fine style . The acoustic set that dominates the middle of the show then gave us a chance to get our breath back , the highlight being a sensitive but powerful version of The Wizard . Spirited renditions of Stealin ' , Been Away too Long and Cry Freedom build up to the seminal July Morning which , believe me , has never sounded better ! The guys still hammer out this classic with such enthusiasm and obvious enjoyment that it still sounds as fresh as the first time I heard it on Look at Yourself . Trevor Bolder in particular excelled himself with some almost miraculous bass work . Mick was clearly enjoying himself no end and entertained us with all the great axeman tricks he has made his own - playing above his head and holding that long-loooong note before blowing it out . Lady in Black - a great singalong as ever , closed this remarkable concert , which is one of the best I have ever been to in all the long years I 've been into rock.A few comments on the DVD presentation . Strangely , the default audio setting appears to be a Dolby surround sound option that only produces silence on my system . I had to go to the audio link -LRB- a tiny option tucked away on the bottom right of the menu -RRB- and select basic stereo to get any sound . Stereo separation was good though , with Mick 's screaming guitar assaulting you from the left , Bernie and Lee centre stage and Phil & Trevor over on the right . I found the sound did need a little bass boost though . Picture quality is absolutely pin-sharp throughout . The camera angles do flit around rather a lot , but not enough to ruin my enjoyment . My main disappointment is that the Magician 's Birthday , including Mick 's show-stopping guitar solo , is bizarrely absent from the DVD . I do n't know if this has anything to do with the rather nasty strobe effect the lighting guys chose to employ througout Mick 's virtuoso performance , but the absence of this track is a big disappointment . Furthermore , it is a shame that most of Bernie 's and Mick 's banter with the fans between songs has also been cut out . No extras of any kind on the DVD is a bit of a shame too , but let 's not get too picky eh ? What music fan could grumble at 90 minutes of such sublime rock?So 6 stars for the Heep 's great music and maybe 4 for this DVD presentation , equates to a rating of 5 overall in my book . Whatever , I just HAD to buy this!When the camera pans around to the left during Stealin ' you can see me -LRB- tall guy in the denim -RRB- and my son , who enjoyed it every bit as much as I did.This is a great souvenir of a great night and , I 'll certainly be there for the 2004 party at Shepherd 's Bush Empire !

 Erin McKeown is a fantastic artist and one I wish more people knew about . She deserves at the very least a sizeable cult following!I 've bought this album at least twice as a gift in addition to my own copy . Erin 's take on standards is great fun , and I defy you not to dance along to the Rhode Island song . I love Erin 's own stuff too , Grand is a near-perfect album - and I 've seen her live twice , she 's great that way too.Basically , buy this album . It is worth every penny .
 I just started listening to Erin with the purchase of Grand . This album makes her releases on my watch list . She just makes enjoyable music . A little folk , a little jazz , a really nice voice , a way of phrasing that is very enjoyable . -LRB- Listen to some very early Diana Krall , and she does n't phrase songs well at all , however later she learned to do it better then most . -RRB- I hear that her live performances are excellent . This album , while not her own songs except for one , I believe , is very accessible to a wide range of listeners . Give it a shot .
 Erin 's voice soars , the band is tight , and the lyrics are classics for a reason . A must buy !
 Erin McKeown does it again , this time wow ` ing us with a collection of old old old covers , from Paper Moon to Get Happy , to Rhode Island Is Famous For You , and every single one has this fantastic bounce and shuffle , you just can not help but smile and bounce and shuffle along with it !! Erin 's trademark voice just shines on these old tunes . BUY THIS ALBUM . you wo n't regret it . the arrangements are great , too , with some smoking brass solos and chilly wurlitzer and organ sounds drifting throughout.Erin McKeown just seems to get better and better each time .
 Easy to enjoy because Mckeown has such a wonderful voice , but when the album is finished it 's less than fulfiling .
 I love Ms. Mckeown 's music . I do have to say that I like the songs she writes better than the songs she covers . Although this album is fabulous , -LRB- if you like a more retro selection of songs -RRB- I prefer her original songs . In my opinion her best album is `` we will become like birds '' followed closely by `` Grand '' . As my tastes generally lean toward the more upbeat songs , I have to recommend `` Paper Moon '' and `` Melody '' on this album , though the acoustic work in `` If You a Viper '' makes me smile contentedly and forget what I was doing .
 i already posted this review for the imported version , but it bears repeating here : Erin McKeown does it again , this time wow ` ing us with a collection of old old old covers , from Paper Moon to Get Happy , to Rhode Island Is Famous For You , and every single one has this fantastic bounce and shuffle , you just can not help but smile and bounce and shuffle along with it !! Erin 's trademark voice just shines on these old tunes . BUY THIS ALBUM . you wo n't regret it . the arrangements are great , too , with some smoking brass solos and chilly wurlitzer and organ sounds drifting throughout.Erin McKeown just seems to get better and better each time .
 A modern gal , rock-folk naif Erin McKeown is both canny and coy in her appropriation of the jazz-standards canon . While her kooky arrangements and half-giddy , half-deadpan vocal performances call a great deal of attention to themselves , McKeown 's obvious love for the material and playful verve will probably win most folks over . To her credit , McKeown has n't just trotted out an overly-reverential pop-vocals showcase , but rather has crafted a distinctive album that illuminates these old songs in a way that her contemporary audience can really glom onto . The arrangements have an off-center quirkiness that recalls the Tom Waits/Marc Ribot school of postmodern cabaret jazz , while her vocals owe a powerful debt to Blossom Dearie . Hard to say whether it 's a testament to the craftsmanship of the songs , or to McKeown 's are n't - I-clever originality , but the lyrics really come to life on several tracks , notably `` They Say It 's Spring , '' `` I Was A Little Too Lonely '' and `` Rhode Island Is Famous For You , '' which are the big successes on this album . Jazz purists are less than likely to love this album , but coffeehouse folksters will go koo-koo over it ... Hopefully they will also be inspired to check out the source material , particularly from singers such as Blossom Dearie , Anita O'Day and songwriters like Harold Arlen , Johnny Mercer , et al. . Either way , this album has a lot to offer to attentive listeners . -LRB- DJ Joe Sixpack -RRB-
 Erin McKeown was previously unknown to me , but a glowing magazine review helped tip me off . -LRB- Now I wish I 'd seen her in Portland a few months ago . -RRB- Her voice is a tad reminiscent of Ricky Lee Jones by way of Suzanne Vega -- what she lacks in vocal oomph and richness , she often makes up for in insinuation and an appealingly wry tone . A listener might miss a full-on big band on some of the zingier numbers -LRB- `` Sing You Sinners '' `` Get Happy '' `` Rhode Island Is Famous For You '' -RRB- , but McKeown sounds so light and infectious they 're still completely winning . And in some cases the stripped-down sound really pays off -- `` Melody '' sounds so loose and casual , you might swear for a moment it was tossed off in one take . Only a few weak spots here and there undercut things
 This was my first exposure to Erin Mckeown . She 's great fun on these standards . I especially am taken with the prominence of the percussion in new and playful ways that help me to hear these songs in a really fresh way .
 This is my first introduction to Erin McKeown , so I am catching her in the `` standards '' side of things , rather than her original material . But I think she does a more-than-credible job of conveying the life of these half-century-old -LRB- and more ! -RRB- classics . I especially like her take on `` Rhode Island Is Famous for You '' and `` Something 's Got to Give . '' And I think that her read of `` They Say It 's Spring '' rivals Blossom Dearie 's , which ai n't easy . The instrumentation throughout is fresh and it really does feel like a jam session you were fortunate enough to be invited to sit in on .
 McKeown takes a number of pages from the classic American songbook , and re-does them in her own unique fashion , from the jazzy `` Something 's Got ta Give , '' to the brassy big-band sound of `` Rhode Island is Famous For You . '' It 's hard to stop yourself from singing along , hearing all these familiar classics.Highly recommended .
 This is a great album - heard a profile about it on NPR.Nice remakes of some old classics.Amazon was great with ordering and delivery .
 I got this as a gift for my brother-in-law , who is a fan . He was so excited !! I also got him the Ani DiFranco
 Tommy Korberg -LRB- K&ouml;rberg -RRB- is one of swedens many hero 's but they are mostly known only in sweden becouse they sing mostly swedish.Other swedish singing hero 's are : Bj&ouml;rn skifs/Nanne gr&ouml;nwall / Per Gessle/Jimmy Jansson/Timbuktu/Grace / Carola/Karin Glenmark/Dr &ouml;mhus / Lizette Plsson etc.Sure these people are music hero 's in sweden but the real Heros are the poor people around this world , but music is good for the soul . PEACE !!!
 On Love Songs for Patriots , American Music Club 's mood is as dark as ever , but infused with the hope of redemption . Filled with yearning and distorted dreams delivered in the most beautifully poetic lyrics , the first three tracks Ladies and Gentleman , Another Morning and Patriot 's Heart set the lugubrious but defiant tone for this masterpiece.The drinking song Ladies and Gentleman is achingly moving in its juxtaposition of the pain of living with either truth or with lies . Patriot 's Heart , about a male stripper , is a masterpiece of conflicting emotions , cynicism blended with compassion and understanding . Wow , this approach is something else , so unique and stirring.There are also gentle and tender moments like Another Morning , an inspiring song about shaking off bitterness and depression , framed in a lovely melody and pop orchestration . Another highlight , and one with a sprinkling of humour , is the gentle ballad Myopic Books . The delicate track Love Is reminds me of their gem of a song Firefly from an earlier album , whilst Only Love Can Set You Free is an appealing love song.The last two tracks , Song of the Rats Leaving the Sinking Ship and The Devil Needs You , are quite ambiguous and may be interpreted on both a personal and universal level . The latter is over 7 minutes long and combines a powerful drum pattern with delirious keyboards and horns to conclude the album on a high note.As with the rest of their oeuvre , Love Songs For Patriots is not easy listening for everybody , but if you love the kind of redemptive sadness often found in the work of artists like Nick Drake , Leonard Cohen , Richard Thompson , Peter Murphy , Swans , Michael Gira 's Angels Of Light , Nick Cave , Emmylou Harris or Jane Siberry , you will love this welcome return by American Music Club .
 It 's slightly difficult . Mark Eitzel 's run-on , rhymeless , occasionally semi-monotone vocal style and Vudi , with his drifting , non-top-40 structured guitars , can always be a challenge at first listen . But , wow , the lyrics and underlying melodies here are stronger than ever , and the production amazes throughout , with the essential mood of each song reflected and reinforced in the backing musical textures . Eitzel 's dramatic voice , intelligence , insight and humor explode and enchant , reach into your heart and calm or move you , or smack you with passionate sarcasm to a sincere grin . It 's truly incredible that , after 10 years , the band can mount a comeback with what I think is their best album ever . It 's one of those rare releases you want to play again and again because you want to rediscover each song and take in `` the whole '' as a work of art each time . Absolutely no top 40 hits here . Zero . But not one bad song . It 's a stunning painting or a complex and stirring novel to the ears .
 A completely expected return to form for those who have followed Mark Eitzel 's career since the disintegration of AMC . Said gentleman 's songwriting skills have only improved since then , as evidenced by a string of stellar solo albums ; truly the only thing that 's been missing is the backing of his old band . This release sounds great to me after only 3 or 4 listens , can only imagine how much I 'll love it a year from now . It 's still a crying shame that Mark and the boys have never gotten anywhere near the level of appreciation that they deserve , I guess this stuff is just too honest for most .
 I was really hoping this album would completely blow me away . But by AMC standards , it 's bordering on mediocre . I have problems with the songwriting and the overall production of the album . First off , the songwriting
 It 's a sad state we are in today when critics and fans prop up snot-nosed skinny emo-boys like Conor Oberst , hailing them as the next Dylan while the American Music Club CD catalog sits in record store bins , gathering dust . Front-man Mark Eitzel , unlike the afore mentioned Oberst -LRB- aka Bright Eyes -RRB- has truly loved and lost and lived to tell about it . Middle-aged and world-weary , Mark Eitzel has been spinning out some of the world 's best damn introspective songs for the last 20 years . And it is a true shame that we had to live without this band for 10 of those years . To fellow AMC fans , and from the reviews posted here I know I am in good company , I say this is a must own record . It is better than their last record , San Francisco , and not quite as good as their masterpiece , Mercury . This record took several listens to grow on me , but like many of my favorite records , it is well worth the effort . I also managed to catch AMC on this tour and they still put on an amazing show . If you have a chance to see them live I highly recommend it . The only thing missing from this record is the beautiful weeping pedal-steel guitar of former member Bruce Kaphan but that is almost made up for by the wonderful keyboard work of new member Marc Capelle . The rest of the members here are also in top-notch form . All musical bases are covered here
 As with all AMC albums , it takes a few listens for the songs to gel , but when they do , it is an exquisite experience . Love Songs ranks up with Mercury and Everclear among AMC 's best -LRB- I ca n't go so far as the incadescent California , though a few of the tracks come close -RRB- . Highlights are the lovely and wistful `` Another Morning '' which like AMC 's best starts quietly and builds to a wrenching climax ; Job to Do and Home are rousing and reflective . Patriot 's Heart seethes with anger and Myopic Books is quiet meditation on loneliness that stays with you . Eitzel proves yet again that he is a master songwriter , and his voice belies living through the heartache/disenchantment he sings of . For a band that was broken up for ten years , it is amazing how timely and tight they are ; I can only hope this is not the LAST AMC album .
 It 's always a sad thing when great bands break up . It seems like the bad ones never seem to get the point . I 'm talking to you Nickelback ! At least we lost Creed and now we have American Music Club back . So the universe of music craposity we are living these days has scored two points towards the positive . This is not quite the masterpiece of Mercury or Everclear but still a wonderful record . You could do much worse . The `` out of tune '' singing is not really an issue . That 's part of the charm of Mark Eitzel . Either he 's doing it on purpose or just does n't give a rat 's . That 's what makes him great . It 's punk , dudes ! He makes the music he wants to make and sings the way he wants to and plays with some cool dudes . Glad to have Vudi back in the picture . That crazy stuff he did at the end of `` Heaven 's 10,000 Whores '' on Mercury is positively brilliant and that kind of witch-doctor `` how 'd he do that ?! '' stuff is back on this record as well . The album does drag a bit in the middle and I can ride in Mark 's slow-mo drink-a-thon stylings for hours but it seems a bit much even for die-hards . At least it peps back up towards the end . As far as getting a new fingerpicking style as Captain Vocabulary says in another review , that 's just silly . Mark has a great style . Would haved like to have heard more Dan Pearson vocals too . Check out earlier works for some great examples of how well Dan compliments an idiosyncratic singer like Mark . Expand your horizons and buy this record but only after you buy Mercury first . Thank goodness for bands like this . Thank you Merge records for putting this out .
 `` If you want to see something patriotic , there 's a stripper ... `` Mmmm ... if your favourite band comes back after 10 years away , it seems fair to say that your hopes and dreams are going to be stacked fairly high . It is testament to this most princely of bands that one of the most special moments of my life - yes , my life - was watching them on stage in Manchester early 2005 and realising that at last they finally looked and sounded in a live setting like what they actually were . The best band in the world . Most of what they played that night came from this album . '' ... He do n't look that good but he 's got an all-American smile ... `` This is the longest AMC album and while it is n't quite the best -LRB- we 're talking degrees here -RRB- it is magnificent and deserves its place in the story of this classic band . '' ... That fills his underwear with all the lonely dollars from all the lonely men who no-one ever suffers ... '' ` Ladies And Gentlemen ' kicks things off in stirring fashion despite being better in its demo form -LRB- another story -RRB- before the first of many AMC classics here
 Well 1st off if u like Jodeci u will like this cd . It most definitely has that feel and they keep the TROOP sound . Do n't know what they were listening to when they rated the CD so low . The cd was on Hammer 's Bust it Records label . The 1st six songs are slow , track 4 has the `` What About Us '' feel . The last 5 are mid tempo and they are decent , guess they wanted the album to be DEEPA but DEEPA type songs were on the DEEPA album . So I encourage you to buy the album if you 're a TROOP fan or not , you wo n't be disappointed .
 I give this cd 5 stars because of all the slow jams on this cd . They moved to a different record label with this cd . But they still kept the Troop sound even though two members left the group .
 as a troop fan since `` mamacita '' i have all troop albums so i thought , i found this one on itunes and if you like troop you will love love love this get it on classic , poohnany classic , blowing my mind classic , break of dawn babymaker ! look stop reading this and add this to your cart !
 I will never forget 1994 when I first got this CD it blew my , mind , straight bananas , aside from the fact that a few members were missing , this Cd exceeded my expections & that of my peers in the hood , Troop added Demetrius Shipp to the roster & even though he produced all the songs , all true Troop fans will appreciate the fact that Lil Steve -LRB- AKA -RRB- Steven Russell -LRB- Lead Singer of Troop `` Spread my wings , All I do is think of you '' -RRB- Wrote the lyrics on all the greatest songs , `` Blowin , My Mind '' the best Troop slow jamm ever , ever Did I say EVER , it will blow your mind other Slow Jamms `` Let 's Get Warm '' & Poohnany '' ca n't be slept on especially if your trying to set the mood for your Lovey Dovey , `` Around & Miss You '' are relevent summer time jams that do n't sound like they were banging in the 90 's , and last but not least `` Do me '' will drive you crazy leaving you bouncing in your seat even when the track is over , If your true to Troop treat your-self DO N'T cheat your Self ... Peace .
 i 'm a fan of troop and i love this cd . i bought the cd when it first came out and someone stole it i very glad there is amazon .
 I love this cd . I saw Robert on this tour and was blown away . He got booked at the Medina which was lame and he even made a supperclub crack . I 've seen Robert live twice now and he was dressed to the nines and sang his heart out . Could someone please give this man his props ?!!
 Nothing but the BEST . I love the first song `` True Love '' . I am sure that that will be the single . This is one of his best CD ever .
 I have 20 Robert Palmer albums in my CD collection , and love each one to absolute bits.His previous album . . , `` Honey '' released in 1994 was what I thought to be his greatest album , then Rythm and Blues was released and litetally put a new meaning to the word BRILLIANT.Its good to see that Robert is doing what he does best ... covering so many styles of music and making each one sound excellent . Up beat songs like True Love is modern , eclectic , and could be played in a nightclub . . , , yet its something my grandmother would like : -RRB- Robert makes a great job of slower `` candle lit romance '' songs like `` No Problem '' and especially `` 20 Million Things '' which is just spectacular.I urge anyone who is a Palmer fan to go and buy this album as you will not be dissapointed . It is his best yet.Thank YouJohn , 17 ...
 If you have not bought a Robert Palmer album in about 15 years , this is the one to get . His voice has never been tighter , the music never so slick before .
 I just love the cd , I highly recommend this cd to everyone . ALL the songs are great . It has a smooth sound to it . Love True love and Wise Guy . Lets get it on 99 ... If you do n't get this one you are missing out on it . A + + + + + + + + + + + + + +
 Addicted To Love , Simply Irresistible , Some Like It Hot ... Robert Palmer can sit back and play the jukebox of great pop hits . But not content with past successes , he continues to strive for future excellence . He simply sets a new standard with Rhythm & Blues . An album obviously meant to remind everyone of the power of 60 's and 70 's R&B , the songs go one step further , updating that style with a contemporary 1990 's feel . No Problem , You 're Not The Only One , Stone Cold , and All The Will In The World are songs Otis Redding and Marvin Gaye would have recorded . And they display Palmer 's classic baritone - the most soulful and powerful voice in the business over the past two decades . You will definitely want this CD , and I ca n't wait to hear this music live !
 Critics and fans were torn on this 1999 Robert Palmer album . Some loved it , some hated it , alternately praising the smooth soulful vocals or complaining the heavy keyboard laiden arrangements or the lack of traditional `` Palmer style '' hard rock . Here , the singer tackles modern sounding pop music with a strong R&B slant arrangement wise . There a few uptempo numbers , particulalry `` You 're Not The Only One '' , and songs like the single `` Stone Cold '' have slower but still scorching dance sound to them . `` True Love '' , the first single , is a definate soul pop ballad that vocally plays into all of Palmer 's strengths as a blue eyed soul singer . `` Paradise '' is easily the most romantic song on the set , and one of the most romantic songs in the singer 's catalogue . Uptempo dominates the set however as ballads sit in the minority . `` Mr Wise Guy '' is another solid soul flavored effort , and Palmer hits all the right notes with a surprisingly good rendition of Marvin Gaye 's `` Let 's Get It On '' . There are no hard rock numbers and no world music numbers , trademarks of Palmer 's earlier albums . Still , this album excells at showing Robert Palmer could not only sing , but compose and produce songs with a definate fresh soul pop feel to them . `` True Love '' and `` Stone Cold '' are clearly the highlights but the album has few misses , even it lacks many home runs . You wont have to be a die hard Robert Palmer fan to enjoy this album .
 I got this cd in 2003 from the U.Kit was alright but something bothered me about it?Over years I listened once and a while.Out of curiosity I bought the Japanses versionJust recently I heard it had different tracksWell It worth every penny I paided for it . $ 11.00 . Rhythm and Blues was released in japan onoct 10 1998 a full nine months , beforeit was released in US . Something happened between oct and julythe UK version has 12 trackstennis replaced dance with me.What really sad about it that both the U.K and U.Sversions are edited and remixed poorlyheres the difference.No Problem 3.42 min japan version U.S version 3.35 I Choose You 5.07 min japan version U.S version 4.18 Sex Appeal 4.48 min japan version U.S version 4.34 minWork to Make it Work 98 4.05 min japan version U.S version 3.33 minAll The Will In World 5.02 min japan version U.S version 4.57 minMr Wise Guy 3.45 min japan version U.S version 3.32 minLets Get It On 98 6.23 min japan version U.S version 4.09 minplus Japan version has bounus tracks Captured a great songSpellbound another great oneand The Long Winding RoadI do n't know happened here . ? But ... it was messed up whatrecord companies did to Robert and his last original music cdIf you enjoy Robert Palmer do yourself , a favor.try find Japanese first version of this cd.It 's great .
 First off , this is not true R&B by any stretch by the imagination but rather true ` blue eye soul ' which is n't bad . I too stumbled upon this CD at a store and decided to take a chance and bought it . I was very surprised at how good this CD is . Robert really searched deep inside and pulled out some of his best vocal work in years . While other reviewers felt this album was soulless I say it was the quite the opposite . On such songs as ` Stone Cold ' , Wise guy , I Choose You , and the title track screams of sensuality that is especially true of Marvin Gaye 's ` Let 's get it on ' . It 's a shame that this CD did n't get the radio play it deserved . But his tour '99 to support it was the coolest !
 I have the import version of Rhythm & Blues . It ranks up with Palmer 's best CDs . The first track , True Love , is equal to Every Kinda People and She Makes My Day . The second track , No Problem , is almost as good . But Palmer turns up the heat a few tracks later with Stone Cold , a potential classic equal to Bad Case Of Lovin ' You and Addicted To Love . Remakes of his own Work To Make It Work and M Gaye 's Let 's Get It On sustain the intensity until the album winds down with a lovely rendition of the Little Feat ballad Twenty Million Things.This may be Palmer 's very best . I have played it now about a hundred times .
 This CD went unoticed by critics and fans upon it 's release in 1999 . It 's a shame for the late PALMER . His vocal performance was both matutre and controlled.The material on this project is sophisticated providing the late PALMER with a new platform to stage a quiet return to the music charts.If you collect CDs by gifted male singers , then I suggest that you try this one .
 Robert is back with his first U.S. Release in five years . It seems his old label EMI and him had a nasty falling out and Robert found it impossible to get a record deal in the states for some time . While Rhythm & Blues is new to the U.S. , it was released over a year earlier in Japan with a couple different tracks and the cover version of `` Long and Winding Road . '' Robert did the song for a Subaru Commerical and it was a mini-hit , enough to get him a deal in Japan . He then was released in Europe several months later and finally in the U.S. on another small label with no fanfare . Nobody knows Robert has a new CD and even less seem to care . Everybody remembers him for Simply Irresistible or Addicited to Love , but Robert was singing solo back in 1974 on his debut record Sneakin ' Sally thru the Alley . He has stood the test of time very well . Robert changes and evolves constantly , he writes and arranges a lot of his music , sometimes he plays the instruments , witness the 1980 album Clues when he does a LOT of the instrumentals . To everyone who likes good music , buy this CD . But I warn you , it 's ment to be played loud ! Keep up the great music Robert !
 kind of an instrumental-gorrilaz sound with great lyrics and very funky beats ...
 I recommend this album . Its funky , different , soulful . For me , a good break from all the crappy hiphop that comes out these days . Much thanks to the twins !
 The Capes ' `` Hello '' follows other similar bands like Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand , but they somehow manage to be noticably different . It 's the same style , but The Capes ' electronic-influenced post-punk/indie rock definitely gives them a unique and different sound -LRB- it 's not an AMAZING new sound , but it 's certainly unique -RRB- . Like the two bands I just mentioned , they certainly know how to create a fun hook . The singer is actually pretty good here , but he tends to verge on unlikableness and yet calm down when you 're almost about to dislike him . He 's not great , but he gets the job done -LRB- I have no idea who to compare him with , though -RRB- . The lyrics are actually relatively interesting as they 're mostly stories . They are n't the greatest stories ever written , but they 're at least fun to listen to on top of the catchy instrumentation . Musically , the production is relatively crisp and clear , and all the songs have a hook of some sort . It 's not the greatest album in the world -LRB- I give it `` 4.5 '' because every song is good and the band sounds pretty different than most other ones out there today -RRB- , but if you 're looking for something to keep you entertained until the next Bloc Party or Franz Ferdinand album comes out , `` Hello '' should do you just fine . Highly recommended!Highlights include : the entire album !
 Absolutely fantastic . I have seen them in London UK a couple of times . Great gigs , even for first timers . Always noticably better than the supporting acts . Good , mature and clever sound . As above , the album only has good songs , there are no fillers . Buy it today ! Go and see them tomorrow ! You will not be disappointed .
 Whatever happened to them ? I wish they made more music , I know I would have bought more . Maybe they will do a comeback tour one day ?
 Although I imagine Ms. Kane turns in her grave everytime she 's mentioned in the same breath as Betty Boop -LRB- She tried to sue the makers of Boop 's cartoons - unsuccesfully - for stealing her persona and by default , her career -RRB- , this collection of all her recordings shows once and for all that she was a unique talent in her own right.Her version of such songs as `` Button Up Your Overcoat '' have never been bettered , sung with a mix of Betty Boop and Eddie Cantor , with all the innocent innuendo you could get away with in the late 20s . Amoung the less well known gems on the disc are `` That 's My Weakness Now '' -LRB- the song that rocketed her career -RRB- and `` I 've Got It and It do n't Do Me No Good ... '' -LRB- what a title ! -RRB- . I 'd love to see some of the films she made for Pararmount in the very early 30s , but I would n't trade this CD for anything . A grade `` A '' genuine classic !
 Most jazz collectors prefer the recordings of Ruth Etting and Annette Hanshaw in the 20 's , because of their whistful swinging styles . Often overlooked are Lee Morse and Helen Kane . Kane did have a squeeky voice and an accent , however she had a wonderful sense of rhythm and her timing was impeccable . She could be just as wistful and swinging as Etting and Hanshaw , and she had charm and humor to add to that . She had what it took to be a jazz singer . This CD brings back all of her recordings from the 20 's & 30 's in digital srereo impressions , thanks to Robert Parker who has restored these timeless performances to sound as though they were recorded just yesterday . All the tunes are wonderful , including her hit `` I Wan na Be Loved By You '' as well as the classics `` Button Up Your Overcoat '' and `` Get Out & Get Under The Moon . '' Most of these songs find Kane backed by top notch jazz oriented dance bands , and on `` I Wan na Be Loved By You '' there is a brief bass sax solo , that sounds very Adrian Rollini-ish . This is the 1st release ever on cd of Kane , and it is exellent , Louisiana Red Hot Records has released another gem . Recommended to anyone who likes good and fun music .
 My 78-collecting sister , father , and I were delighted to see this finally issued , as Helen Kane 's 78 's are quite hard to find and never cheap . This cd is -LRB- the only existing -RRB- collection of Babs Kane 's entire catalog for RCA Victor from 1928-1930 . This is my favorite -LRB- pre-rock -RRB- era of American Music - just before the Swing era took the country by storm , and just after the roaring 20 's flapper craze , in a delightfully innocent time that was n't without its share of thinly-veiled sexual innuendo and giddy gaities . Helen does n't sing as much as talk -LRB- or squeak -RRB- through many of these tunes , all of which are above average for even this golden era . Her band is innovative and amusing , walking the line between the ` sweet ' sound that was coming into vogue in this period , and the novelty bands of the earlier 1920 's . If you 're a Betty Boop fan , a novelty music fan , or just want to take a trip to a bygone innocent age , this is for you . All classics , all remastered in brilliant sound .
 If there 's a place in heaven for people who are just downright pleasant , Helen Kane is sitting it it at this moment . For my money , there 've never been better renditions of `` Button Up Your Overcoat '' and `` I Wan na Be Loved By You . '' And `` Dangerous Nan McGrew '' will make you squirt milk out your nose . Feeling a bit down ? `` Get out and get under the moon . '' Any one of these songs makes the CD worth owning . `` Me and the man in the moon '' say about Helen
 Helen Kane is one of those `` vintage '' artists people either love or hate . She was a huge Broadway star in the late 20 's but her career faded quickly and today few people recognize the name . Such a shame for an artist that was so unique.I have been collecting original Helen Kane 78 's for years and was delighted to find this CD . The sound quality is good considering the sources though I would have prefered a crisp original mono sound to simulated stereo . -LRB- I do n't know why labels feel that kind of processing is necessary . -RRB- If you like novelty dance music of the 20 's or if you like Betty Boop , you will love this CD .
 I really ca n't say much more than has already been said about Helen Kane 's performance style
 Helen Kane is the flapper who was the model for Betty Boop . When you listen to this CD , you can appreciate just how well Mae Questal , who provided the voice of Betty Boop , imitated Helen Kane . The music on this CD is great fun . Not only do you get to hear more complete versions of songs that Betty Boop sings , but there are also songs like `` He 's So Unusual '' that Betty Boop should have sung .
 While most folk will connect Helen Kane with Betty Boop , the songs on this set stand on their own merits . Delights such as `` That 's My Weakness Now '' and `` I Want To Be Bad '' speak more for the `` Flapper '' era in America than any textbook could . This set contains all of Helen 's recordings .
 If you 're a Betty Boop fan , this is a must have CD . Betty was modeled after Helen Kane , and sung many of the songs on this CD . Mae Questal , the voice of Betty , was chosen partially because she had won a Helen Kane impersonation contest . Questal was indeed a master at voice immitation , as this CD clearly shows - one might think that many of these songs were recorded directly off of the talkartoons !
 I would have to disagree somewhat with the last reviewer ... granted , I HAVE NOT heard this cd from Robert Parker , but have dozens of cds from this Australian sound wizard , and have been very pleased with all of them.He was basically the first to show us that you did not have to put up with poor sound quality just because a record was recorded in the late 20 's ... instrumentals usually come out best with this enhanced stereo sound -LRB- miles ahead of the junk that the big record companies put out in the 50 's -RRB- but the 78 's used are very clean , and if vocals have a slight echo effect , just switch your system from stereo to mono and , enjoy the best sounding recordings you are likely to hear of hers ... if Yazoo put this cd out , you would not be able to hear her singing for the hiss from the worn out 78 's they use on their cds !
 Another unbelievably incredible album from GLC , I like many other people didnt think they had it in them , to follow such a hilarious album with another and not have it wear thin . Standout tracks abound on the album , my personal favourites bad boy limp -LRB- hilariously rippin the piss out of frivilous claims culture and the idiots who keep it going -RRB- , paranoid -LRB- about being a stoner obviously , rapping over the tune of the snowman -RRB- , charmschool -LRB- rapping over the Grangehill themetune -LRB- a popular school drama in the UK -RRB- -RRB- , R&B a piss take of boy bands and the genious `` hit song '' . i loved the album and they were awesome at Reading earlier this year . The formula shouldnt work twice but it really has , this time GLC are back more astute , with better rhymes and hilarious as ever . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 All I can say is , no matter what kind of music you listen to , this is hilarious . And it has great beats . And it never gets old . I love this album , especially `` Maggot At Midnight '' . This is such a great follow-up to Greatest Hits/Straight Outta Newport '' . You will not be disappointed .
 I thought the sound was slightly overproduced and the A and R breakdowns and look of the band was slightly Universal and commercial other than that it 's pretty intense Post Hardcore and definitely worth your hard-earned cash .
 If you are into stuff like Camouflage , Depeche Mode or And One you are going to fall in love with this CD from the first listen ! Great unprocessed vocals , romantic lyrics , catchy sequences ... it 's all here!One of the best synth pop records I 've ever heard !
 14 songs for 25 bucks ? Huh ? Is it worth it ? Is this rerelease a true blues classic or just mainly over-priced filler?It 's beyond worth it . This is the cream and the butta , ladies and germs . Rogers -LRB- a guitarist 's bluesman , every note is choice -RRB- was usually in the shadows of the vocalists with whom he worked . NOT HERE . Damn . These 14 tracks are bar none the best of Rogers early 50 's output . The cornerstone of a Rogers collection and best -LRB- albeit most expensive -RRB- introduction to this particular bluesman.The players are all the Chess badasses we know and love
 Well , you have to pay import price for it , but the very best introduction to singer/guitarist Jimmy Rogers is finally back in print.The last surviving member of the original Muddy Waters band , Rogers died in 1997 , just before the release of the enjoyable `` Blues , Blues , Blues '' which included re-recordings of several of his best songs . But this 1976 album remains the best collection of Jimmy Rogers ' classic Chess sides , and the list of sidemen reads like a who 's who of 50s Chicago blues : Muddy Waters , Fred Below , Willie Dixon , Otis Spann , Little Walter , and of course Big Walter Horton , whose reputation as the eternally unequalled King of the blues harmonica is only enforced by his mind-altering 24-bar solo on `` Walking By Myself '' . Almost all of Jimmy Rogers ' best Chess sides are here
 How is it possible that this album is out of print ?

 If you like blues guitar at its best then this is the album for you . Rogers was Muddy Waters ' axe man . Muddy actually plays on these songs . My favorite is Going Away Baby . You may have heard Eric Clapton play it on the From the Cradle album . This is the original and it 's the best . There are n't any weak spots on the record . Every song will keep you listening . A must have for any aficianado of the blues .
 I love Muddy Waters in all , but its just something about Jimmy Rogers that just puts him over Muddy Waters with this album . With all the timeless hits like `` Walking By Myself , '' `` Goin Away Baby , '' `` Ludella , '' Money , Marbles and Chalk , '' how could you not grow obsessed with this artist that stemmed from Muddy Waters ?
 Jimmy Rogers , who learned from people like Tampa Red and TBone Walker besides the Memphis Jug band while playing with them , shows what he learned here with `` Chicago Bound '' . Jimmy then played rhythm guitar for Muddy Waters in the 40 's and 50 's when there were hundreds of Blues clubs in Chicago . Here he is doing his thing while playing some sophisticated Chicago blues before really anyone else . Some incredible songs here and not a bad one in the lot . Jimmy was also a great writer as you can listen and hear for yourself . A must for serious blues lovers and performers .
 A classic blues CD that was n't over-produced . Only my Best of Muddy Waters sits higher in my CD case . Little Walter and Muddy Waters both play on a few songs . For those who like blues bands , this is a must have . If you 're looking for blues guitar solos treat yourself to Albert King , Freddie King , or Albert Collins , not this CD . This is the total package , and that 's what makes it so great .
 This album is truly great ! I bought the cassette for 6 dollars some years ago . When I finely wanted the CD , I was told this albums was a collectors album and costs $ 45.00 to me that is Highway Robbery for any music !!!
 Not sure why I added this one to my large collection but it is now one of my favorites . My biggest regret is not getting to see him live before he died . Unlike some CDs where there is only one or 2 good songs this one has lots of great songs .
 Buy this one , `` A present for the future '' and `` Live ! '' These are the best albums from Frank 's catalogue . The freshness and creativity of these albums are uncommon and really exeptional . The music of BNG is light and entertaining and could easily be appreciated by the Jazz neophit . But do n't consider this an easy listening album . It is challenging and adventurous , simply Frank could make the most difficult progressions sound very easy and acceptable . His playing here is absolutly marvellous . I treasure this disc because of the enjoyment it gave me from the day I bought it -LRB- more or less 15 years ago -RRB- since today . I ca n't get enough of these three albums . With these three Frank definitly entered on my map firmly !!
 Every shred player should be forced to hear this CD . Frank uses a very light tone and plays every note clean as a bell . This CD shows what it means to make every note count and NOT show off . Sure , Gambale plays some very fast solo 's in the CD but , they flow with the music , the music is what counts , the solo 's just add a little flash . Frank 's solo 's are so flowing even with the very complex chord changes it makes most shred players sound like hacks.To be simple about it , this CD is speed picking with class !
 A friend loaned me this on cassette tape about 20 years ago . At the time I was a guitar performance major in college . I had JUST started listening to all kinds of jazz and I liked pretty much anything that had big , shiny chords . I listened to this for weeks nonstop before giving the tape back to my friend . Being young , stupid , and busy , I then forgot about it . Just now I came across one of these songs on YouTube and it all came back to me . I can sing along with most of these melodies all these years later - they are really strong tunes . And the playing is creative and exciting . Some of the keyboard sounds have not aged too well , but other than that , this is a timeless jazz recording . I wo n't forget about it again .
 OK , I will start off by telling you that I do NOT own THIS particular cd , however , I do own MANY of his other cd 's ! Frank Gambale is probably without a doubt , the best guitarist I 've EVER seen , met , or heard . Yes , on a technical level even better than Yngwie , John McLaughlin , Al DeMiola ... etc -LRB- And I 'm a HUGE fan of ALL these guys ! -RRB- This guy is a freakin ' technical guitar genius ! I 've never seen a guitar player like him . I got to meet him one night when he played with Chic Corea 's electric band , and I was absolutely FLOORED with what this man is capable of doing on a guitar -LRB- and he 's a very nice person too ! -RRB- ... Being a guitarist myself of many years , I did n't think what he does is humanly possible ! But , he is just amazing . Anyway , I 'm SURE this cd is just as good as any other Frank Gambale CD , However , `` Note Worker '' and `` Thunder From Down Under '' are my 2 favorite cd 's from him . Here 's the deal , if you 're a guitar player and want to be simply amazed , or just appreciate some really good Jazz music , you 'll really dig Frank Gambale . Give him a shot , your ears will thank you for it .
 I found this CD in Amazon 's suggestions . This CD is great ! My favorite songs are
 As a usual `` Grinch '' at Christmas , I am not a big Xmas music fan . HOWEVER , this Cd is my favorite . It is Upbeat and Stylish . It is a wonderful instrumental . Its `` clear '' arrangements get you singing or humming the words -LRB- in your head ... remember it is an instrumental -RRB- right along with it . It fills the room with the family-feeling of Christmas . I play it for my open house and on Christmas morning when we open gifts . It is great backround music too . A MUAT HAVE for any CHristmas musically Library .
 This is awesome ! The group has a great talent for music - Hensley 's voice is a one-of-a-kind that keeps us listening . I 've seen them on stage and what a show ! You can see how well they `` click '' just watching the bass and the lead guitar player interact keeps the crowd involved too . The live CD was no let down either - equally as good if not better than `` Thoughtless and Cruel '' . Keep the tunes coming - you guys are terrific !
 This , the second album for the Minneapolis based District is a definite must have ! There is a great range of classic covers , and creative originals . All the tracks will make you want to get up and dance . Hensley 's vocals are outstanding , Ruiz ' songwriting superb , and Johnson 's guitar work is amazing . This album is a definite must have for any mpls . sound lover .
 This album successfully captures everything that makes The District so badly missed in the MN music scene . It captures the now broken up band at it 's pinnacle . Nick 's voice and Mike 's words speak directly to a fan of music with substance . If you like bands like Big Head Todd and older Barenaked Ladies albums , you will love The District .
 I 've been waiting for a band like this to come along for a while.I caught these guys in Chicago a few weeks ago , and wow!The ld singer gave me the CD free 'cause he was too drunk to make change . But not too drunk to put on one of the best vocal performances I have ever seen or heard . These guys are the real deal . They reminded me of Springsteen and E street . Someone needs to take a look at these guys and give them a shot.Buy this CD , you wo n't want to take it out of the car.And some of their new songs they highlighted really puts them out there , electric blue grass , soul , rock and roll , these guys have it all .
 I have been listening to these guys for quite a while . This live album highlights The District at there prime . The energy behind the songs are unbelievable . Not to mention the crazy crowd that seems to follow them where ever they go . Do n't miss this opportunity to check out the magic of live music in MN .
 Sure , there are more than a few Elvis anthologies out there and , yes , there is nothing on this set that is n't readily available on a few hundred other compilations , but this one is noteworthy in its own way , and a great collection as well . Focusing less on hits than on great performances , `` Essential Elvis '' gathers a handful of Sun sides , the best of his early RCA output and acclaimed sides from throughout his career . You get the best of Elvis ' many hits as well as critically-acclaimed album tracks -LRB- `` Reconsider Baby '' , `` Trouble '' , the live `` Polk Salad Annie '' -RRB- , and that , for once , is a unique concept in Elvis reissues . Everyone will have differing opinions on what should or should n't have been included , and tob sure sure some great tracks have been left out , but this is a whale of a great collection of `` essential '' Elvis .
 If you were stranded on an island and could only take one Elvis cd with you this would be the perfect one.There is not a bad song on this cd and it is a good and pleasant listening mix of all of his music.You get the blues , rock , rockabilly , gospel , movies , and some live concert music.One of the best arrangements of songs of all the cds that have been released since his untimely death.If you grew up listening to Elvis music it will bring back so many memories and if you are just getting acquainted with his music you will be pleased and will build happy memories.Not a bad price.Buy it , play it once and you will not want to play anything else for a long time.You will be hooked.This cd brings to mind what all the fuss was about .
 Good CD to buy . Remastering is great , the third disc is a nice addition . Everyone knows the songs , you may have them , but this is a very well mastered CD and if you have the older Elvis stuff from the 80 's -90 's this will be a jaw dropping improvement over the poorly mastered RCA days . Avoid all of them!Good job Sony Music .
 This CD has essential songs in it , but of course there were several that were left off . `` Hitstory '' is still the recommended compilation . Actually `` 24 Karat HIts , '' but that CD is very rare and out of print . The first disc has only 20 songs and clocks in at less than an hour ! It is also loud , so it does not seem natural , but this is DSD remastered by Vic Anesini and special thanks to Kevan Budd . I think they used their own remasters from their previous discs , combined them for this release , and tweaked the volume so they match . It 's still a recommended purchase for completists .
 I looked all over for a CD set that would have darn near every hit of Elvis ' , and this seems to be it -LRB- better than the &#34; official &#34; &#34; Elvis # 1 Hits &#34; , as that one for some reason does n't have &#34; Viva Las Vegas &#34; -LRB- !? -RRB- -RRB- . But , get the 3.0 edition of this -LRB- golden cover , eco-friendly cardboard packaging -RRB- , because that has a third disc with &#34; Let Me Be Your Teddy Bear &#34; , among others .
 I bought this cd for the price -LRB- 3 cds for $ 15 ! -RRB- BUT was floored by the sound ... I really did n't expect much of an improvement and was very surprised . Gives the remastered Beatles a run for the money !
 This CD has all or most all of Elvis 's hits from the early days to later days . The sound quality and mix was very good and up to modern standards.Listening to it took me back to my youth when I remember Elvis performing Hound Dog on the Ed Sullivan show - If anyone is old enough to remember that on this website .
 It takes a GIANT of an entertainer to create a two cd set that is filled with all fabulous songs . Elvis Presley stands so distinctively above all other popular music vocalists that such an all fabulous songs cd set is exactly what you find in The Essential Elvis Presley . If anything , The Essential Elvis Presley is an understatement of Elvis ' unmatched and enduring musical legacy . It would have been possible to extend The Essential Elvis Presley to four song-packed cds and these four cds would have still contained all fabulous Elvis ' songs . I own and am familiar with about 80 of Elvis ' best cds and cd sets , so I know what I 'm talking about . Elvis Presley still remains and probably will always be the KING of Rock N Roll , rhythm and blues music , and slower romantic ballads . The Essential Elvis Presley does a very thoughtful job of selecting 40 songs to include in this two cd set . I am especially pleased that the song selection included Fever , Steamroller Blues , Ca n't Help Falling In Love , Peace In The Valley , Reconsider Baby , and the original , not the remixed version of , A Little Less Conversation . I am disappointed that Any Way You Want Me , One Broken Heart For Sale . and Ask Me were not included . The remastered version of Reconsider Baby emerges on The Essential Elvis Presley as perhaps the best rhythm and blues song that Elvis ever recorded ! The song selection also does an excellent job of sampling Elvis ' songs across his entire singing career ; from the beginning to the end of Elvis ' singing career . All of the songs have been remastered so the sound quality of The Essential Elvis Presley is outstanding . It makes perfect sense that anyone who is an ultimate fan of Elvis Presley , as I am , should purchase , or more likely re-purchase , his/her favorite Elvis ' music in remastered form , because one can then best hear and appreciate the greatest beauty of Elvis ' fabulous music . The Essential Elvis Presley should be a MUST BUY cd for every true fan of Elvis Presley ; it has my strongest positive recommendation.John
 This is a great collection of songs from probably the most famous and influential rock star of all time . It includes many hits , several groundbreaking recordings from his Sun days , and a few lesser known songs . While this is a great set of music , I ca n't help but ask why was this released ? These songs have been released numerous times through the years and most avid Elvis fans already have them . Casual fans would probably appreciate the `` Elvis 30 Number 1 Hits '' CD better.Don ' t get me wrong , this is another great collection of Elvis songs , but nothing that you ca n't already get on other collections . If you want an `` essential '' 2 CD Elvis set you can get both `` Elvis 30 Number 1 Hits '' and `` 2nd to None '' for almost the same price that you can get this collection , and you would get 61 songs instead of just 40 . Or if you wanted to spend a few more bucks , you could get the 3 CD `` Hit Story '' release.Instead of coming out with `` new '' compilations every few months , I think BMG/RCA would do better by pushing some of the excellent releases they already have on the market and re-releasing some of his albums that are out of print domestically with some rare bonus tracks . Or why not release the next `` Gold Records Volume 6 '' to catch the songs that were left off the first 5 volumes of that series ? If they want to keep releasing compilations , they should at least include a remix of a song to try to attract the interest of potentially new and younger fans . Just re-releasing `` new '' collections of the same songs that have been released numerous times is not cutting it . They need to come up with a better marketing strategy for Elvis ' outstanding library of music ! It appears some of the poor management practices that hurt his career and legacy have continued after his passing !
 I bought this CD to introduce my 6 yr . old to some different music that I could also listen to . He loved it ! It has some really great songs on the CD and we will be listening to it as a family for a long time to come .
 This 2 disc CD is wonderful ! We have listened to it several times and it never gets old . The song selection is wide range and covers everything from sentimental to romance to rock ! I would recommend this to everyone !!
 I 've always Dug Elvis Presley . this is a Great Introduction collection a Double set that is on point . Suspicious Minds is My Favorite Presley song to this day . these Songs still hold up so well & Elvis 's voice is the main reason . he left a distinctive impression with how he presented his take on songs . i already have Elvis collections , but this One is a very Good . a Must have .
 The Essential is a marvelous album presenting Elvis Presley as he still is
 I enjoy listening to Elvis . This CD has so many of my favorites . If you are an Elvis fan , this CD is a must for your collection .
 What were they thinking when they put this collection together ? Yes , it has almost - ALMOST - all of Elvis 's greatest hits but where is `` One Night '' ? And why , why , why would they dare to include Elvis 's horrendous live version of `` Polk Salad Annie '' and omit a classic like `` One Night '' ? It is for that glaring omission and that glaringly bad inclusion that I give this collection a rating of 4 rather than 5 . Hey , I love Elvis Presley 's music as much as anyone but he had no business recording `` Polk Salad Annie . '' There 's only one version of that song that should ever be heard and that 's the original by the song 's writer , Tony Joe White .
 I thoroughly enjoy this CD set . It has every song that I love of his . Great item .
 Well , who 'd give an Elvis Presley album less than five stars if they 'd gone to all the trouble to hunt it up and order it ? Of course I like it . A day without Elvis is like a summer without roses . Why we do n't give every newborn an Elvis CD is beyond me . Sometimes the federal and state governments lack imagination . A nice album . I would have been happier , though , if it had contained `` A Fool Such as I '' . But it did n't . Neitherwas `` I Want You , I Need You , I Love You '' . Nor was there `` Trying To GetTo You '' . But , you know , it 's so cheap and sleazy to second guess the poorguys that have to jam a major artist 's work onto two CDs . The EssentialElvis Presley is an excellent starting point for an Elvis collection .
 Without question , Elvis has been the most anthologized artist in the nearly thirty years since his death . So how is this collection different from the others ? The short answer is -- nothing . If you 're a die-hard fan , there 's no reason to buy this . But that 's not true for the casual fan who 's looking for a comprehensive overview of perhaps the most influential performer of the 20th Century.This mid-priced two-disc collection covers every aspects of Elvis 's career , beginning with his first Sun single `` That 's All Right '' through the 1977 single `` Moody Blue , '' which topped the country chart just months before his death . In between are hits from every stage of his career -- 50 's rock 'n' roll classics like `` Hound Dog , '' movie hits like the million-seller `` Viva Las Vegas '' and comeback hits like `` Suspicious Minds '' -LRB- his first No. 1 in more than seven years ! -RRB- . Sure , there are missing tracks -LRB- including nine No. 1 's , like '' -LRB- Let Me Be Your -RRB- Teddy Bear , '' `` Stuck on You '' and `` Good Luck Charm '' -RRB- , but for the casual fan who only wants one anthology in their collection this works nicely . However , with a total playing time of less than two hours , it could have been more inclusive . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
 I 'll not spend time reviewing the songs we all know them well . I 'm here to answer the question as to why another greatest hits collection ?? 1 . This is the Elvis entry in Sony 's fine `` Essential '' series . CertainlyElvis merits representation .2 . Not everyone owns the other hits collections mentioned in otherreviews . New fans `` discover '' Elvis all the time .
 You just got to love Elvis ' music and this Cd is no exception . I have a mentally challenged daughter that we found out loves Elvis and it was bought for her ! She lights up when it is played and zones out to Elvis !
 Bought this for a friend as a gift , got fast shipping , excellent quality , and overall pleased with the performance and quality of the seller and the product . It was a big hit for my friend and I will definitely recommend it to others . + I love that is has those extra songs ! : -RRB-
 This is Great music from the master . The quality is exceptional and transfers you to an earlier , simpler time . Excellent !
 The package come very quickly and all albums were in it.They came exactly as decribed and appeared . The price was reasonable for all the albums
 This album has proven to be one of the best I have . It covers a great variety of his music and is very entertaining . My 14 year old grandson thought it was really great for old music .
 This collection has all the classic Elvis songs and will be great for music during our Elvis Presley weekend breakfast .
 There 's a smaller percentage of people alive who listened to Elvis during his peak popularity so I guess the sales are falling off by now . We bought this for the nostalgia of it . The recordings are very clear considering that the original source had to be old reel to reel magnetic tape , not as flat sounding as some of the pre 1970 's music .
 You will not make a mistake buying this Elvis CD ! This IS Elvis as you remembered him or as you want to know him now . What a star ! What a voice ! DO NOT buy a musacked CD where the cuts are sanitized because he was thought to be so outrageous . This , along with Elvis Live , just about does it and if I had to choose one ... well it could be a toss-up but this one would cover a lot of ground . You ca n't go wrong with this one ! No wonder , when I arrived by boat , from Cos , Greece , to the seaport of Kusadasi , Turkey and stepped off the ferry the seaside cafes were blaring Elvis . Trite but true he rocks for eternity !
 I was pleasantly surprised with this cd . This is the music that made Elvis , from That 's all Right to Suspicious Minds . You can always find a song to sing along to .
 How can you go wrong with Elvis ? I love it . It is exactly what I expected . The cd 's arrived in excellent conditrion and I could not be happier .
 I love the music from the 50 ; s and 60 's . This CD is fantastic . Never get bored from listening to this music . It contains all the great love songs , so much passion !!! Smart , really smart to put all these great songs on one CD . Have it all with out having to buy ten different CD 's to get the music I wanted .
 I would n't say I 'm a die hard Elvis fan , but I 'm thoroughly enjoying these 2 CD 's . These songs bring back many memories of me watching his concerts on tv or his movies . He has a very smooth , sexy voice and it saddens me that he is no longer alive but am grateful for the music he left behind . If you are a true fan of Elvis , you will enjoy these cd 's .
 One great song after another . I love this CD and would strongly recommend it .
 Being a casual fan of Elvis , and liking more songs I had heard year by year in various places etc. . . when this one became available I finally decided to pick it up . Other than the obvious big hits , it has some lesser known songs for the casual fan like myself who wanted to go to the next level.Never really been a fan of his gospel or love songs for the most part , but have taken a liking to some I had never heard like `` If I Can Dream '' , `` Kentucky Rain '' -LRB- which are both up there in the top ten favs of Elvis now -RRB- . `` Fever '' is a song I like also that just burns in a good way perhaps.Basically , there 's 34 songs on here I really like out of the 40 , and a couple I could go either way eventually ... plus the ones I skip . But overall this is a nice surprise since it 's twice as many songs or more that I like now and most of them i had barely heard before if ever .
 It is worth the money to buy this CD especially at Amazon . com . No second thought of purchasing another CD from Amazon.com
 wonderful compilation of elvis ' work from the early to final years.note the advances in recording technology over his career .
 I learned to play the melodeon by listening to the original vinyl version of this album for two years , and it was almost completely worn out at the end of that time from repeated play . JK is the outstanding melodeon player of his time and , in this style , perhaps the greatest ever . Despite the new generation of young players and the new generation of faster and better instruments , nobody gets a tune out of an old Hohner 1-row like Kirkpatrick can . As an introduction to the 1 - and 2-row diatonics this is a must-have , and the bonus is to hear them both alongside the big three-row chromatic instrument , sometimes all in the same set of tunes . I grudgingly decided to drop a star because not all the tracks here became personal favorites , and of course Kirkpatrick 's full range of talents is not on display here . You would need more than one album to experience that . But for followers of the English melodeon and those interested in hearing a great player showing what a relatively cheap instrument is capable of , this album is a must .
 Barney the Dinosaur is big in stature , big in popularity among the younger set , and big in the field of entertaining his fans by singing the songs that are most popular with them . I Love To Sing With Barney is no disappointment in this last area . There are lots of old Barney standards on this CD as well as lots of fun new songs from Barney 's latest series of PBS episodes . The accompaniments to all of these songs are delightful and keep Barney 's old standards such as The Clapping Song and Our Friend Barney Had A Band as entertaining as the new compositions included on this CD . Anyone who is a Barney fan will enjoy hearing this recording time after time .
 If your kid is hooked on Barney , this CD will contain a lot of songs that are in the Barney videos . My daughter recognizes the songs and grunts along , very interactive ! Because she is hooked on Barney , we need to have him on TV , in the car and all the time , so this is the CD we play while we are in the bathtub . Her favorites are the `` raindrop song '' -LRB- ah-ah-ah she goes ! -RRB- , the yum-yum song and the `` clapping song '' . Anything that makes her happy in the bathtub wins points with me . Thanks , Barney !
 My son got this cassette as a present , and he loves listening to it in the car . Unfortunately , our new minivan does n't have a cassette player , so now I have to get the CD version or else listen to my boy demand `` Barney ! '' every 30 seconds . I only gave it 4 stars because I think it would be better if the genre of the songs was more varied -LRB- rock , classical , folk -RRB- , like our Sesame street songs .
 I purchased a barney CD before , and I was not happy , this CD however made it right . My one year old listeing to it in the car , and it is great . Riff is cool . This is a great CD to buy if your little one like Barney and friends .
 This is a great CD for children . I keep it in my car for my 2 grandchildren ages 2 and 5 . They both love it . I even sing along !
 Barney came back strong with this one and gave us his illest best hardcore . His duet with baby Bop made me bop my head as i heard it in my 3 inch bazookas ... Im looking forward to his upcoming remix with Busta Rhymes and Nas ... just lawd to sing to this s. . t im out god

 An excellant album ! We listen to the local `` Radio Disney '' 640 am out of New Jersey and the kids love the music . I did n't hesitate to buy this CD when I found it and the kids play it every day . It has a terrific assortment of the latest hits , most with an energetic beat that the kids dance like crazy to . They were surprised when I played the original `` Lola '' hit and said , `` Hey , that 's the `` Yoda '' song ! '' . I came back to Amazon in search of a second `` Radio Disney '' CD . I guess I 'll have to wait since a second album is n't out yet . You wo n't be disappointed with this CD . My kids range in age from 2 to 10 yrs , but adults will like this album , too . There are a couple of good hits to do aerobics , Kick-boxing , Karate -LRB- my favorite -RRB- or housework -LRB- not my favorite -RRB- to . Something for everybody !
 I work in a before and after school progream and we own all the the Radio Disney Cd 's . My 1st - 5th graders love it . They know the songs from radio and the disney channel , and I do n't have to worry about inappropriate lyrics .
 The track listing on here is fairly good , with Steve Vai , James Brown , and many other popular performers -LRB- hopefully after hearing these musicians , my nieces will begin to find less worthy children 's `` music '' such as Kidz Bop as musically tedious and unsatisfying as the rest of my family does , and I admit that , even as a 27 year old woman I have recently found myself tuning into Radio Disney -LRB- to become familiar with and `` hip to '' what my nieces like and listen and actually enjoying much of what I hear . Much of what is on this CD and channel appeals to adults and children alike , making them so much better than so much other `` family '' music . I recommend this to anyone who has kids in their lives , as this music remains totally appropriate , but is not watered-down `` kiddie '' music that talks down musically to your kids .
 in my opinion this is the best cd radio disney put out . there are a few songs that i could do without but the majority of them are great . the kids love it and the parents enjoy it also . nice up beat songs that will get you and the kids moving ! ENJOY !
 I purchased this c.d. for my son 's 10th birthday . He had been asking for this for sometime . We played it at his birthday party . All the kids loved it ! They danced . They sang . They had a fantastic time.Thanks Radio Disney .
 this cd is exactly the amount of awesome that i remember . when i saw these cds on amazon i knew i had to get them . they are an amazing part of my collection . -LRB- i have one through 5 -RRB-
 my kids and i have always loved this cd . we have all of the radio disney cds in our collection . but this is our favorite . we just the think the songs are so much fun for the kids as well as the adults . it brings back a lot of memories . so when our original cd got scratched , we were all disappointed . because you ca n't find this cd in the stores any more . but thanks to amamzon.com we were able to replace it at a reasonable price . now we are all happy again .
 The kids are always listen to the radio disney cd 's . We have 3 out of the 4 that are available . They seem to really enjoy the variety of music on it . A lot of it is really fun to dance to . My Daughters especially enjoy the dancing . The boys like the humor in some of the songs .
 this is a CD you can dance to . it 's a real energy boost , and everyone can listen to it . a real treat for former viewers of `` the all new mickey mouse club '' is that there is a song by the group MMC on there . -LRB- also a treat for 'n sync fans , since JC Chasez sings lead on that song -RRB- very good CD
 I love the music on this CD because it takes popular music and makes it suitable for children ... a very fun and festive selection of songs ! Kids love it too !
 When are you coming out with volume two
 The Retelling of Dreams is the most mesmerizing music I have heard in a very long time . I hope more cds will be coming along shortly .
 I 'm not always impressed by `` all-star '' ensemble chamber recordings , but this is definately an exception . Kempff , Szeryng & Fournier play with all the coordination necessary to provide exquisite readings of Beethoven 's under-rated piano trios . It 's too bad their complete cycle is out of print , so I make due with the Beaux Arts Trio -LRB- also wonderful -RRB- and the Istomin/Stern/Rose Trio . But if you can get your hands on the complete cycle by the 3 artists on this recording , by all means do so -LRB- I saw a used copy for around $ 200 , which I refused to pay , but you may feel otherwise -RRB- . If not , this disc is a wonderful sample of 3 first rate artists performing 2 of the best chamber works ever written .
 Just to think in Wilhelm Kempff at the piano , with his unsurpassable cantabile line , Henryk Szerying ' s notable expressiveness and unique tune , and the refined phrasing of Pierre Fournier , should be a proof of unerring and faultless musicality and the most genuine musicality , so hard to find in these times , where there are soloists of blazing technique and articulated phrasing , but we must accept the era of the great trios is actually placing across an unsaid crisis , because by unknown reasons don ' t endure the demanded time to grow up together . Although this statement is far to be applied for the rest of combinations of chamber ensembles . The String Quartets genre is perhaps the most solid and promising among the diverse possibilities but , where are actually the distinguished musical inheritors of famed ensembles of the past as the Bush Quartet , the V&eacute;gh ensemble , Budapest String Quartet , Vienna Konzerthaus , Karl Haas , Collegium Aureum , Zagreb Solooists or the duos of Cortot - Thibaud , Bachaus - Fournier , Richter - Rostropovich , Casadesus - Francescati or Serkin - Casals or Heifetz-Rubinstein ? This visible lack of historical chamber ensembles has affected in sum grade a broad segment of the music because this blending allows to grow up and establish several communication lines as well as to affiance not only friendship ties , but permit establish a continuous exchanging of points of view and visible process of enhancement around each component . . The distinctive and fortunate conjunction of these three notable and phenomenal soloists made possible for all of us to enjoy the most remarkable set of these piano trios.I would just like to advise you about the definitive versions of the phantom Op. 70 and the Archduke Op. 97 are to my mind the famous recordings made by Pablo Casals , Karl Engel and S&aacute;ndor V&eacute;gh with the Op. 70 and Horszowski and V&eacute;gh recorded in Prades 7/1061 and Bonn 9 / 1958 respectively in an anthological album label Philips
 This is truly a great CD . It takes full advantage of the `` album '' concept . It 's not necessarily a story , although there are common elements that run throughout ; but it 's more a general mood , an overall feeling of innocence and romance and longing . This is one of those CDs that has really grown on me the more I listen to it and is now one of my favorites . It 's synthpop , although not dance-oriented -LRB- but there are a couple of more upbeat tracks , `` Red Ambition '' is a good example -RRB- . You will not regret getting this CD .
 This second album is not disappointing at all . Faith Assembly continues their traditions in making a rich new romantic album . Plenty of great songs here ; however , you need to listen to this album a few times before you finally captured it 's whole essence . `` Shades of Blue '' is still my favorite FA 's album . If you wan na start exploring FA ; I suggest you pick up their first album -LRB- Shades of Blue -RRB- first . Peace !!
 mmm rock n roll baby ... rock n roll
 I 've been impressed by Minassian 's playing with Peter Gabriel and Afro Celt Sound System , and was intrigued when I found he was releasing an album . As a collector of Duduk music -LRB- and duduks -RRB- , I 'm utterly astounded at how beautiful this album is . Levon 's tone is gorgeous and his accompanists -LRB- piano , keyboards , ney flute , violin , tenpur , oud , and percussion -RRB- do a wonderful job of complimenting it . Most of the tracks feature Levon 's duduk soaring over wonderfully minimal backing tracks , but a few feature some breathtaking vocals courtesy of Roselyne Minassian and Herve Teboul as well . This is the most genuine and successful world music albums I 've ever heard .
 this CD depicts the Armenian Duduk 's mysterious and captivatingtunes that trenscend the conventional yet faithful to it 's awefilled essence - soul music of a nation whose melodies of lament still beckon justice ... nourishing for souls of conflict
 I was a little nervous that this might be a world music exercise in the worst sense of the phrase , particularly with the other instruments listed , since the duduk is at its best when solo or solo with a drone.However I was very impressed by the whole CD . The playing is first class , and manages to be both mellow and incisive . It is always good to hear other duduk players , apart from Gasparyan , since outside Armenia itself , few other `` names '' appear on the CDs available -LRB- although there is a Californian Armenian label - which is available in Armenia but which I have never seen in the UK -RRB- . Wonderful !
 It is fantastical power of sounds of this Doudpuk , to express a tragic History , the history of Armenian peoples ... but a music wich it is with o lot of HOPE .
 MR A.Peterson -LRB- South California -RRB- , I 'm astonished by the beautiful music of this album . The mellow sounds of this beautiful armenian instrument are amazing . I can not imagine that anyone would not absolutely treasure every note of Mr Levon 's performance .
 Great tool to help with practicing . Allows the student to experience playing in an ensemble and makes if FUN !!!!
 FARID EL ATRACHE , KNOWN AS FARIDO BY HIS FANS , IS PROBABLY THE BEST OUD PLAYER OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY , CERTAINLY IN THE ARABIC SPEAKING WORLD.THIS IS A FINE LIVE RECORDING OF PURE SOLO INSTRUMENTAL , WITH EXTENDED TAKSIMS -LRB- IMPROVISATIONS -RRB- ON THE CLASSICAL MAQAMS , SIMIALR TO RAAGA IN INDIAN MUSIC . I LOVE THIS ALBUM . PERFECT NIGHT TIME MUSIC , OR FOR WAKING UP IN THE AM.CHEERS
 ... when musicians made their music without the aid of synthesizers of mixers or computerized studio workstations . Not only is `` Freddy '' -LRB- as he is affectionately called by fans -RRB- the King of Oud , he has a magical voice . There is a craftsmanship and depth to his music that I really enjoy .
 Think Slayer , playing Tommy Dorsey or Glenn Miller songs , with Danzig on vocals . Simply amazing . This record is almost a religious experience .
 Ahh ... madder 'n hell that I ca n't find a copy of this ! Coolest album ever written . Got to open for these guys in Little Rock and Richmond , KY. I ca n't imagine how many hungry ears would relish this masterpiece !
 I found this compilation to be quite interesting as well as satisfying . It 's a great collection for long time fans as well as an excellent starting point for newcomers to the Hawkwind phenomenom . The liner notes give an incredibly detailed summary of the history of the band as well as a visual package that is stunningly retro and modern at the same time . As the `` Collectors Gold '' label on the cover states , the two discs are indeed shimmering metallic gold . However , I 'm not sure if it really does anything to enhance the sound quality of the discs , which is excellent with the exception of a few of the early live cuts . Most of the material is rare or unreleased and spans every incarnation of Hawkwind . Disc one starts off with the then named `` Hawkwind Zoo '' doing `` Hurry on Sundown '' and `` Sweet Mistress of Pain '' , two Dave Brock compositions from 1969 which have a very 60 's psychedelic `` More '' era Pink Floydy kinda acoustic pop feel . These tracks are followed by `` We Do It '' and `` Earth Calling '' , two low quality live recordings that are still interesting for the atmospherics and sound effects . Next up is a really cool rocking version of `` Kings of Speed '' which is all instrumental and with more prominant synth/effects than the original track off of `` Warrior on the Edge of Time '' . After this we have a killer version of Lemmy 's `` Motorhead '' with Dave Brock slamming out lead vocals as well as a mind boggling lead guitar solo . The next two tracks are `` Spirit of the Age '' and `` Robot '' which are from Hawkwind 's Bob Calvert led `` New Wave '' period around 1977-78 . `` Spirit '' sounds like a studio version and `` Robot '' appears to be a live track that starts as a basic new wavey pop number that evolves into an incredible space jam/lead guitar ramble reminiscent of something off of `` Space Ritual '' . Closing out Disc one are 4 live recordings by the Brock/Calvert side project called `` Sonic Assassins '' . These tracks were culled from a Christmas 1977 Festival gig with track one being an amusing add libbed/improvised version of `` Over the Top '' . This is followed by `` Freefall '' , `` Death Trap '' and a great live version of the Hawkwind classic `` Golden Void that incorporates the new wave synth sound of that time period . I found this live portion to be quite entertaining and very well recorded considering I never really liked much of the Calvert led Hawkwind . Disc two starts off with two tracks by the second version of the Hawklords . The second version of the Hawklords heard here is Dave Brock finally taking the forefront again with `` Valium Ten '' and `` Time Of '' which rocks with a reminiscence of the jams heard on `` In Search of Space '' and `` Space Ritual '' . The new wave elements are still there , incorporating more keyboard/synth sounds of the time rather than spacey elements -LRB- as heard here on `` Robot '' -RRB- , but it still leans more towards heavy rock . Finally we have a return to the feel and vibe of `` Warrior on the Edge of Time '' era Hawkwind with the inclusion of the rare `` Earth Ritual Preview EP '' from 1983 . This is the kind of Hawkwind material I truly love . Etheric , mystical medieval fantasy rock with heavy Blue Oyster Cult influences permeate `` Green Finned Demon '' `` Dream Dancers '' and `` Dragons & Fables '' . These songs also feature the phenomenal guitar work of Huw Lloyd Langton accentuating Brock and the rest of the band . Disc two ends surprisingly with a rare Dave Brock interview from 1987 . At first I was n't to thrilled at this inclusion since they could have filled the space with music but I changed my mind after I heard it . It 's very informative and Brock comes off as incredibly witty and playful . He also fills you in on a lot of Hawkwind history as well as his insights and influences . This collection overall is incredibly well done and it 's the price of only ONE cd and both discs are GOLD too ... if you really get off on Hawkwind and you do n't have any of this rare stuff on vinyl already , you need to seriously check it out ... you wo n't be dissapointed .
 Basically , this is a repackaging of everything from ` Mighty Hawkwind Classics ' with a half a dozen bonus tracks added . Do n't get me wrong , it 's a good disc to own as it 's nice to hear another version of `` Spirit Of The Age '' as well as `` Golden Void '' . There are two live cuts here , of `` Earth Calling '' and `` Robot '' but my favorite on the entire 2-CD release would have to be their old B-side single `` Time Of The Hawklords '' . Other worthwhile songs are the 12 '' version of `` Valium Ten '' , `` Hurry On Sundown '' , `` Death Trap '' and `` Night Of The Hawks '' where Lemmy guests.I also liked the half-hour conversation with group founder Dave Brock.He speaks of several topics , like Hawkwind should 've been six Dave Brocks or about the time the entire band did hashcakes before a gig.Then by the time show time had arrived all the members stood around on stage like a bunch of zombies forgetting what they were there to play.Nifty eight-page fold-out CD card that tells about each song in detail.What a great buy .
 Many tunes for the dollar . Great sound quality of rare items . The rendition of Brock singing `` Motorhead '' and instrumental `` Kings of Speed '' are particularly satisfying . I enjoyed the -LRB- bonus -RRB- 30-minute , relaxed interview with Brock and , yes , can listen to it repeatedly . See the other reviews for details .
 Hawkwind - Golden Void 1969-1979 -LRB- Purple Pyramid -RRB- For all the U.S. Hawkwind fans who have not been able to get any of theirback CD catalog since it was deleted in the U.S. when Griffin Music wentkaputs , Purple Pyramid has issued a great 2 CD limited edition gold setGolden Void 1969-1979 . This set collects 20 explosive sci-fi psychedelicnuggets plus a '87 interview with head Hawk founder/leader Dave Brock . Fromthe earliest Hawkwind '69 gem `` Hurry On Down Sundown '' right on through totheir '83 Earth Ritual Preview EP which featured ex-Hawkwindbassist/Motorhead GOD Lemmy blasting in for 1 tune on `` Night Of The Hawks '' . This set also collects the 2 Dave Brock & Robert Calvert short lived brainband Hawkwind spinoff the Sonics Assassins -LRB- their only 4 cuts -RRB- andHawklords -LRB- 2 cuts -RRB- . The rest is a killer dose of pure Hawkwind magick ! Agreat booklet -LRB- it folds open into a mini poster -RRB- in full psychedelic coloris loaded with info on the bands history and a song by song by Brian Tawnof Hawkwind Feedback . Hey , there are some rare pixs also . Thanks to theremastering job and being that these are gold CD 's , the ` sonics ' arelevitating ! as Head Hawk Brock says at the opening of `` Valium 10 '' ` No Ido n't want you to panic ... Just lean back and relax ' . Get this CD , throw iton , get ready to visit the cosmos and do the same !
 Very good quality for analog to digital transfer . Songs are also well worth listening too.This is perhaps another classic next to Space Ritual .
 Since my husband is half French , I bought this CD to help introduce French to my young children.All the songs are short , soft , simple , and pretty . Most songs are sung by a single adult male or female singer with minimal musical accompaniment.The CD includes some of the most popular French nursery rhymes , but usually only the first one or two verses . Indeed , when my husband 's French relatives sent us some CDs from France , I was quite surprised to find that many of the songs had so many additional verses ! Still , this CD is a good introduction .
 One of my favorite CDs for learning French . You ca n't go wrong with this one .
 Gorgoroth 's third output is more of a return to the grand classic `` Pentagram '' . This could very well be described as a more compact high-speed version of `` Antichrist '' , as fast often-changing riffs fill this disc , riffs that still maintain the ingenious neo-classical atmosphere of earlier albums . The rather infamous production of this offering gives it a bouncy , warlike twist , as the drums are almost ridiculously distinct , but do serve a purpose . Gorgoroth 's emotional compositions suit even this aesthetic to perfection , and this work is great both song by song and as a destructively optimistic unity . Excellent .
 `` Under the Sign of Hell '' , the ultimate triumph of Gorgoroth 's compositions is raw , primitive , and with a sound that can be explained as souding as if it was recorded hundreds of years ago . Do not misunderstand me , Gorgoroth is certainly not simplistic , especially in terms of Infernus ' guitar structures which often conjure a mesmerizing , soul devouring quality . Pest 's vocals are that of a hallucinating mad man , screaming in schizophrenic evil abhorrence during one hell of a black trip . Drums are courtesy of Vrolok , the epic drummer of the mighty AETERNUS , who lays down the catastrophic tempos present on this album . Ares , also of AETERNUS provides mountainous bass rythms on `` Revelation of Doom '' . Gorgoroth 's method of creating the most grim and bleakest of atmospheres is exceedingly convincing on this record . Be advised , this band is the essence of true black evil , using a horrid and caustic expression which enables Gorgoroth to possess a unigue sound that can not be overlooked . Of cousrse , this is not the album to begin a black metal collection with . Instead , one should progress toward its extremity . HAIL GORGOROTH !
 This is the first Gorgoroth album i 've ever bought , and it is some of the best black metal i 've ever heard ! The first song on the album , revelation of doom , was a tad misleading at first , everything is perfect about it , except the drums . The drums in that song sound very odd , the only way i can explain it is someone hitting a sheet of metal with a hammer . For some reason though this is the only song that the drums sound that way . Ghaal 's vocals are incredible , they 're the trademark hoarse screams of most norwegian black metal . The guitars are good but i find myself straining to hear them , the drums are turned up way too high in the mix . BUT the drums are awsome do n't get me wrong , the drums are lightening fast and brutal as hell . There are two VERY small details about the album i have to point out . Track 5 is n't even a song at all , it 's just odd noises and sounds , and on track 8 at the end of the song there is a 2 minute void where the only thing that 's present on the album is this odd noise that sounds like you 're driving down the road with the window all the way down -LRB- minus other cars driving by -RRB- . Otherwise this is an excellant black metal album , i recomend it too all black metal fans .
 This album marks the introduction of Gaahl to Gorgoroth , and with it their days of notoriety . The album is split between the outgoing vocalist -LRB- Pest ? -RRB- and the new and as a result has that hodge-podge transition sort of sound . I think this is the album -LRB- my opinion -RRB- , that they started to become more produced and perhaps more melodic . Take that with a grain of salt , this is n't Cradle of Filth . As I am a fan of their newer stuff for creativity reasons -LRB- the older is classic low fidelity dark Black Metal -RRB- , this marks the start of my favored style . Perhaps a good starting place , though I would recommend Destroyer or Incipit Satan first , unless you 're a purist , then perhaps start with Pentagram or Antichrist . Good album the first track -LRB- Revelation of Doom is the only real standout -RRB- . Good album for Gorgoroth , not their best , but slays the weaker bands .
 This is Gorgoroth 's best CD ever released . . the overall atmosphere is grim ! Gaahl is one of the best BM vocalists in the scene today . Do n't believe me ?? Go check him out in other projects such as Trelldom -LRB- amazingness -RRB- , and Gaahlskagg ! Besides the amazingly hideous vocals , the guitars are right up there in your face w / the chainsaw buzz . Drums are violently beaten , i love the way the drums were produced . . crunchy ! There 's really nothing else to say about this , it ' either you worship it or not . . I think this is their best . Unfortunatley , Gorgoroth are n't the same band anymore they have changed a lot recently , soo the old releases is where it 's at , folks ! Hail -LRB- old -RRB- Gorgoroth !!
 First things first ... Gorgoroth
 Even though , I believe Pentagram is their best to date , I had to review this one for the simple fact that it was the first gorgoroth album , I bought ! This band in general is very innovated in a world that has commercialized metal , into this hybrid shock rock - do n't let the war paint at first glance fool you , this is nothing like the mainstream crap you hear on a daily basis . Gorgoroth , is under-rated and this is why I like them . Touring with 1349 in the twilight of the idols tours , they bring the real slab of what black/death metal was , and is trying to bring it back into the world . I recommend this album , to those who love 1349 , emperor , cryptopsy , and goatwhore .
 I love it . The production -LRB- Like Destroyer -RRB- is so uncompromising and brutal , and the voices are tormented and hectic , along with the buzzsaw , hoarse , guitars that Gorgoroth are famous for . Pest 's vocals are quite possibly the second best I 've heard -LRB- with Gaahl tying with Attila Csihar as the first - let 's not get into the whole Attila vs. Dead argument , wrong band -RRB- but the drums are really what made this album . They are distorted a bit , high in the mix , and recorded in a garage , it seems , which gives them a chugging along sound , a very crunchy , percussive sound , which only benefits this album . This album uses melody where it 's needed , and the melody is n't minimalist melody either ; it 's just demonic melody . Melody you can imagine Gorgoroth doing.Aside from that , all I have to say is WHY ARE YOU STILL READING MY REVIEW ??? GO GET THIS PIECE OF PURE NORWEGIAN SLAUGHTER ALREADY !!!!
 Awesome . I ca n't even tell you how good they are . This is some of the best black metal I 've ever heard . Blood Stains the Circle is my personal favorite track . Gorgoroth is one of the most ferocious black metal bands ever , and should be praised like gods . Buy this album if you can handle such brutal ass stuff .
 Barney the Dinosaur is big in stature , big in popularity among the younger set , and big in the field of entertaining his fans by singing the songs that are most popular with them . I Love To Sing With Barney is no disappointment in this last area . There are lots of old Barney standards on this CD as well as lots of fun new songs from Barney 's latest series of PBS episodes . The accompaniments to all of these songs are delightful and keep Barney 's old standards such as The Clapping Song and Our Friend Barney Had A Band as entertaining as the new compositions included on this CD . Anyone who is a Barney fan will enjoy hearing this recording time after time .
 If your kid is hooked on Barney , this CD will contain a lot of songs that are in the Barney videos . My daughter recognizes the songs and grunts along , very interactive ! Because she is hooked on Barney , we need to have him on TV , in the car and all the time , so this is the CD we play while we are in the bathtub . Her favorites are the `` raindrop song '' -LRB- ah-ah-ah she goes ! -RRB- , the yum-yum song and the `` clapping song '' . Anything that makes her happy in the bathtub wins points with me . Thanks , Barney !
 My son got this cassette as a present , and he loves listening to it in the car . Unfortunately , our new minivan does n't have a cassette player , so now I have to get the CD version or else listen to my boy demand `` Barney ! '' every 30 seconds . I only gave it 4 stars because I think it would be better if the genre of the songs was more varied -LRB- rock , classical , folk -RRB- , like our Sesame street songs .
 I purchased a barney CD before , and I was not happy , this CD however made it right . My one year old listeing to it in the car , and it is great . Riff is cool . This is a great CD to buy if your little one like Barney and friends .
 This is a great CD for children . I keep it in my car for my 2 grandchildren ages 2 and 5 . They both love it . I even sing along !
 Barney came back strong with this one and gave us his illest best hardcore . His duet with baby Bop made me bop my head as i heard it in my 3 inch bazookas ... Im looking forward to his upcoming remix with Busta Rhymes and Nas ... just lawd to sing to this s. . t im out god

 These guys are from Finland ? This release sounds like good old fashioned ass kicking USA southern blues rock/metal . COC/Down/Sixty Watt Shaman -LRB- now defunct -RRB- fans will love this work . It moves , it grooves , and really defies the stereo typical stoner genre -LRB- it is NOT ! -RRB- . The vocals are seasoned to the style , and fit perfectly with the raunch and roll of the thumpin ' rhythm section and controlled distorted riffage . The music , and musicianship execution is awesome , and is matched by excellent songwriting . Any respectable headbanger should have this release ; buy it !
 This 1964 Academy Award winner for Best Song `` CHIM CHIM CHER-EE '' , performed by Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke in the Disney 's multi-hit `` Mary Poppins '' , is nothing less than spectacular by Chip Davis and Mannheim Steamroller gang.Each selection seems to have that original sound , works so well with the tunes we grew up with and still enjoy to this day , thanks to the clever arrangements of Chip Davis . A wonderful compilation of songs from today and the past , given the `` steamroller '' treatment , fresh and upbeat.Chip never ceases to amaze his fans , with `` HAKUNA MATATA '' , `` GO THE DISTANCE '' , `` YOU 'VE GOT A FRIEND IN ME '' simply outstanding ... but the highlight is `` WHEN YOU WISH UPON A STAR '' the 1940 Academy Award winner for Best Song , beginning with `` twinkle , twinkle little star '' , blending and interwoven beautifully by Davis and the Mannheim gang . Chip sets his standards to the highest level with every album , and his impeccable rhythm and incredible control of dynamics is the mainstay to all of his fans ... Mr. Davis , you 're ONE OF A KIND!Total Time
 I almost did not get this CD after listening to the 30 second samples , but I 'm now glad I have the CD . Anyone who likes Disney tunes will appreciate these fun arrangements . Chim Chim Cher-ee , Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah , Under the Sea , Davy Crockett , Heigh-Ho , and When You Wish Upon a Star are the best of the lot . Although Hakuna Matata is not faithful to the original song from the score of The Lion King , it is an absolute hoot ... you got ta listen to it .
 I just received and listened to this selection . I totally disagree with sboloch 's review . This person is obviously not familiar with Mannheim Steamroller 's / Chip Davis ' work , which is to build their own sound AROUND a familiar tune , to add and tweak it , as well as create their own original music . I had no problem finding traces or whole sections of the Disney music , which was totally acceptable within this structure , with the exception of HAKUNA MATATA . Nothing except the words was kept from that piece but perhaps the words were the only thing they were after . I usually purchase the Xmas CD 's but thoroughly enjoyed this one . As a person who watched the original Mickey Mouse Club , I found the last selection to be positively haunting , akin to my favorite Mannheim Steamroller piece , SILENT NIGHT . If we all wanted to hear the original tunes as produced by Disney , Disney makes their own CD 's . Kudos to Chip Davis !
 This album put together two of my favorites -- Mannheim Steamroller and Disney . The arrangements are creative and quite surprising . I imagined myself inside the `` Haunted Mansion '' when I first heard `` Chim-chim-chiree '' and `` Davy Crockett '' was done so naturally that I could envision `` Frontierland '' vistas . All in all , a really fun listening experience .
 Mannheim Steamroller 's style of music has n't changed as long as their first Christmas CD . They have a talent of taking original music and transforming it into another world of synthisizer and adding their own creative works.The reason I gave it four stars is because I know Mannheim Steamroller likes to add their own touch , but this music was a little too off , especially `` Hakuna Matata . '' They spent too much time on the startup , the ending , the background , and on top of all that , the tracks were too short . For example , the average track on the CD took about one minute to reach the actual tune , and took a minute to end it without using the tune , and the tracks were all about three minutes an thirty seconds so the actual tune went on for only thirty seconds ! The point is they went too off track.But although the tracks are a little off , Mannheim Steamroller succeeded once more in making a wonderful CD that takes original songs and transforming them into a world of imagination . For any Disney freaks , buy this CD .
 Having heard the samples online , I was a little concerned , but I really enjoy the album . I find it quite `` sleepy '' , not exactly the typical excitement found in many Mannheim Steamroller stuff . I hope that in future albums , the variations follow the emotion of the original . Under the Sea , for example , in the movie is the show-stopping big production number , but on this album , it 's really quite slow and peaceful . The album is a must for a Disney music collector like myself , and definitely something to look at for those who like Mannheim Steamroller .
 Even tho not available to everyone yet this CD has made it into the hands of Mannheim Steamroller fans and people at Disneyworld . If you know the Steamroller sound you will find practically every nuance from previous Steamroller albums including the Fresh Aire series . If you are more of a Disney `` music fan '' you might be a little disappointed . For Steamroller fans it is in many ways a `` classic '' . Bringing out the `` Chip Davis '' sounds from all previous albums and putting them on one . A favorite of mine is `` Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah '' followed by `` The Ballad of Davy Crockett '' . It 's too bad that there are only 12 cuts on the disk . But maybe `` Meets the Mouse II '' will be coming in the future . Some of my favorites were not found on this album ... but still many made the cut for this first album .
 `` Mannheim Steamroller meets the Mouse ''
 I admit , this is my first Mannheim Steamroller CD , but I am a Disney nut , and buy all there stuff ... anyway , now I am a Steamroller fan and looking for more of these CDs . If you like Disney , or Mannheim , BUT THIS ... it is EXCELLENT .
 If you enjoy the Christmas CD 's , you will like this one too . It 's a mixture of old and new Disney songs , and I would n't be surprised if this turns out to be a series of CD 's , similar to the Christmas series . -LRB- That was a direct hint to Chip Davis -RRB- The style of the songs is nothing new to long-time Mannheim Steamroller fans .
 When I go on vacation , I take * many * digital pictures . I then fuss with them in Photoshop , put them into a presentation with music , and put the whole thing onto DVD . It 's a great way to relive the vacation . We went to Disney World for Halloween in 2006 , and I needed music to go along with the eventual presentation . I was drawn to Mannheim Steamroller Meets The Nouse because I very much like this group 's Christmas music . I am not finished with the presentation as yet , but so far I have used `` Chim Chim Cher-Ee , '' `` Hakuna Matata , '' `` When You Wish Upon A Star , '' and `` Under The Sea . '' Listening to Meets The Mouse affords an adult appreciation for the Disney experience . If you listen carefully , you will detect subtle humor , such as a vocal `` hoo , hoo , hoo '' to each drum beat in `` Hakuna Matata , '' eventually followed by `` I , do n't , know . '' Also , the `` Wish Upon A Star '' piece incorporates `` Twinkle , Twinkle Little Star '' with the expected Disney melody in a clever , seamless fashion . You must appreciate the group 's skill here .
 This is `` happy music '' . I play this more than all the other Mannheim C.D.s that I 've collected . Great sound !
 This is a neat CD of songs Walt Disney is famous for , done in Mannheim Steamroller fashion . If you are not already familiar with Mannheim , they have a truly unique sound . It 's exciting music . Often , they have a sort of medieval sound . You expect to walk into a big hall and see all the Knights at a huge dinner with lots of pewter utensils and a dozen huge roasted turkeys on the banquet tables and lots of wine . The jousting is outside.This time , Mannheim takes Disney classics and adds their special tones , synthesizers , sound effects and music instruments to these songs to make them certainly recognizable , but also much enhanced.The 12 album tracks are : Chim Chim Cher-ee -LRB- Mary Poppins -RRB- Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah -LRB- Song of the South -RRB- Under the Sea -LRB- The Little Mermaid -RRB- Hakuna Matata -LRB- The Lion King -RRB- Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious -LRB- Mary Poppins -RRB- Go the Distance -LRB- Hercules -RRB- The Ballad of Davy Crockett -LRB- Davy Crockett -RRB- Heigh-Ho -LRB- Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs -RRB- You 've Got a Friend in Me -LRB- Toy Story -RRB- When You Wish Upon a Star -LRB- Pinocchio -RRB- Reflection -LRB- Mulan -RRB- Mickey Mouse March -LRB- The Mickey Mouse Club -RRB- Anyone who likes these Disney movies will likely be thrilled with this CD . The music is uplifting and `` cute . '' This is happy music for the car , at home , or in the office . This CD also makes you think of the Disney movies . Like me , you 've probably seen most of them . My favorite was The Little Mermaid . I guess I am just a hopeless romantic.This is a great CD for your collection , with 12 tracks of uplifting , appease-your-inner-child music , totaling a tad over 39 minutes . Oh , Geeze ! Now I keep singing `` When You Wish Upon a Star '' ! -LRB- But , it 's soooo purdy ! -RRB-
 You HAVE GOT TO hear this Cd -LRB- or almost any Mannheim Steamroller Cd for that matter -RRB- in 7 Channel Stereo . It 's one of the few CDs -LRB- and I 'm not talking about DVD-As or SVCDs -RRB- that is mixed so well that the 7 CH Stereo mode can pick up and reproduce all 7 -LRB- not 3 , 4 or 5 but all 7 -RRB- channels . If you do n't believe me , I challenge anyone , even audiophites to but this Cd , -LRB- used if you do n't want to invest much into an experiment -RRB- , set your multi channel to 5 or 7 channel stereo , and raise the volume to about 90 - 92 Dbls , -LRB- careful , this is one of those HDCDs that play at about 10 Dbls higher than most Cds -RRB- . Start with `` Davey Crocket -LRB- sounds hokie does n't it ? -RRB- , -LRB- all 7 Chs . morph from an individual back and forth 7 way dual to a full separated blend -RRB- , next `` Under the Sea '' -LRB- you will swear that your about to be drenched by a wave -RRB- , Mulan is very cool also . This is a FULL 3D sound field . Now my 7.2 system may be more exotic than most , but this has got to sound awesome on even a `` Home Theater in a Box '' level system .
 This is a fun album , especially if you 're a big Disney fan , or have kids who are . Chip Davis does a good job with the arranging , and it has the Mannheim sound that we all love . BUT , I have to say that this is not their best album . I like it , but I do n't love it .
 If you are a fan of Mannheim Steamroller and all things Mouse then you should enjoy this album.The elements so familiar in all the Mannheim Steamroller music , the keyboarding , electronic , natural sounds , and percussion , are clearly in play.People who have visited the parks may find this an enjoyable reminder . It 's of the same flavor as some of the ambient music that is played throughout . In some of my visits to WDW I seem to remember hearing Fresh Aire tracks , so The Steamroller style fits in . This album is certainly peaceful , and fits into the background nicely.Is it the very best Mannheim Steamroller ? Perhaps not . The enthusiasm from the Fresh Aire work missing a little . It 's still a good album , though if you can only buy one Mannheim Steamroller album then you may want to continue researching your purchase . -LRB- -LSB- Arched Eyebrow -RSB- ... and why do n't you have them all ? -RRB- If you have most of their work then you probably should seriously consider this one as well.And if you love `` The Mouse '' ... Well then .
 My father , of all people , found this album while browsing the shops at Disney World in Orlando Florida ... He bought the CD and played it for me and my three boys and we were immediately impressed with the entire album . Our favorites are Hakuna Matata -LRB- you can tell Chip had fun making this one -RRB- and the moving ballad of Davey Crocket is awesome . Mulan has fast become my family 's most favorite Disney movie because of the message of courage and family love so it 's no surprise that we appreciate what Chip Davis did with the song Reflection . And of course no Disney album is complete without the Mickey Mouse March . We love all the songs on this album and highly recommend it . I hope the future holds a Mennheim Steamroller meets the Mouse volume II .
 As stated in other reviews , if you like Mannheim Steamroller and Disney , you ca n't go wrong with this CD . I have always been interested in hearing Chip 's rendition of various musical charts and this is n't a disappointment . We had a lot of fun trying to guess what the song was without looking at the CD cover . Try doing that with the Ballad of Davey Crockett . I 'm hoping Chip and Mannheim Steamroller will come out with more Disney CD 's . Or , even better , compose the score to one of Disney 's films ! That would be great !
 Mannheim Steamroller meets the Mouse is definately one to buy . If you love the music from some of Disney 's most notable movies and if you have heard Mannheim Steamroller 's music you will definately love this collaboration . Having had the remarkable chance to see them live in concert was a great thrill . Even while they performed many of their other compositions they introduced the audience to this forth coming album by playing `` Under the Sea '' from Disney 's `` The Little Mermaid '' . Once I heard them play it in their own special way , I had to get it and I am glad that I did . However what happened to `` Hakuna Matata '' . Otherwise another great job by Chip Davis and Mannheim Steamroller . I hope that they are able to make another Disney based album and another and another and ...
 This album was better than I thought it would be after listening to the samples ... The only real disappointment was `` Hakuna Matata , '' which did n't seem to have any of the real melody in it . If you enjoy Disney music , especially albums like Heigh Ho Mozart and Bibbidi Bobbidi Bach , give this one a try .
 It was my son -LRB- a Marine and a long time Mouse fan -RRB- that introduced me to this CD , knowing that I enjoyed Mannheim Steamroller . It is an enjoyable collection of music . I wish that Mannheim would produce additional music based on the Disney movies . The music brings back wonderful memories - of Davy Crocket , the Little Mermaid , and I think my favorite , When You Wish Upon a Star .
 Chip Davis performs his magic on classic Disney songs . Songs we all know and love . Mannheim Steamroller at their best ! You will enjoy it .
 I have not received my own copy of the cd yet , but listening to a friends copy inspired me to purchase my own . .
 I love this cd so much . I had purchased it many years ago and lost it . I had backed it up to my computer , but I realIy wanted the actual cd and I ca n't tell you how happy I was to find it here -LRB- to be honest , a fellow Disney Addict sent me the link -RRB- ... I bought 2 this time . If you are a Mannheim Steamroller fan , this cd is incredible . If you are a Disney fan , this cd is a MUST HAVE !!!! Get a couple copies as you will want to gift this to another . It is a great baby shower gift .
 Not necessarily a must have - especially for kids , but certainly a nice addition to the music collection of adult Disney fans who also like Manheim Steamroller . Enjoyed Brian Wilson 's -LRB- The Beach Boys -RRB- Songs In The Key Of Disney more .
 We first saw this at Disney , but did n't purchase it . When we went back a few weeks later - they were ALL gone ! But when we found it on Amazon , we snapped it up - and it 's everything we hoped for . Mannheim Steamroller is one of our favorite sounds , and when that sound meets The Mouse ... it 's incredible !
 Just what I ordered and my wife loved it for christmas and it arrived before christmas . I did n't expect it arrive sooner then the 7 to 10 days they usually tell you ... Great
 I bought this CD for my daughter 's big , multi-age family for SUV listening after enjoying the tape myself . They all love it ! The music is complex and there 's something new with each listen . The pieces are fun as they playfully interpret familiar melodies , a unique fusion of jazz and symphonic music . Pleasant mental exercise for long car rides .
 This is a great album of Disney Classics set to the unique style of Chip Davis . I think it is great and I wish he would do another one - It makes the Disney songs a little more `` mature '' to listen too .
 I HAVE BEEN A GREAT FAN OF MANHEIM STEAMROLLERS FOR MANY YEARS . I LOVE THE MUSIC AND ALL THAT THE MUSIC HAS OFFERED ME . I HAVE YET TO SEE THEM IN PERSON . SO I AM HOPING SOMEDAY SOON IT WILL BE POSSIBLE .
 Oh my Heavens ! This is the most fantastic CD that I have ! How could it not be - it 's Mannheim Steamroller ! Turn the volumn up to hear all the different instruments . Relax and enjoy every minute of this wonderful CD . Mickey would be proud !
 This product is excellent , I got it for my dad 's birthday and he plays it all the time in his classroom for his kids . There are a few teachers that are going to purchase it because they like it as well . Wonderful music !
 Mannheim Steamroller 's unique sound lends itself perfectly to the `` Mouse . '' Wonderful music for all who love Disney !
 It was a great choice , we enjoy `` Mannheim Streamroller meets the Mouse '' . Good for all ages .
 This is a replacement CD purchase , for me . I loaned the first one out and it was not returned , but still worth every penny . Great music !
 Easy listening . Enjoyable . However , unless you have the Table of Contents you are n't always able to tell what the song is . When you are a `` Mouse '' connoisseur it 's annoying .
 I bought this CD for my daughter who was born on 8/20 . The cd is very calming and actually helps put her to sleep . Her Dad and I also enjoy listening to the CD with her ! A great buy , I would highly recommend this CD for yourself or for a gift !
 I am a Djay for a comeback radio show . It 's always hit & miss checking out all the comebacks of older bands . This one was a big positive surprise . I like their sound now better than in the 60 's , with the exception of the masterpiece `` The Letter . '' The first 4 tracks of this album are super . Wang Dang Doodle is a great blues song that I liked by Koko Taylor and the Box Tops do a terrific version of it here . As I was listening to the album and enjoying it all I thought that the only thing I hoped they 'd do is put a more hard rockin jam song in tthe mix , and then they gave me just that with the last track of 6 minutes called Big Bird . I play this album quite a lot and have played 9 of the tracks on my radio show . I 've gotten very good feedback about the songs . The Box Tops are still touring and one more album would be nice . This is a great addition to their catalog of great music .
 The band has chosen great songs and performs with infectiously high spirits . This album does not revisit the Box Tops ; rather , it frees them to truly enjoy the music without the constraints imposed on the band in the '60s . It 's looser than Alex 's recent solo work , but in the same general vein . Highlights are `` It Tears Me Up '' and `` Flying Saucers Rock and Roll '' and `` Big Bird '' and ... forget it ; they 're all good .
 The Box Tops new CD , and may I say first release in many too many years , recaptures those same good time feelings that seemed to permeate the late 60s . The music , mostly covers , is exceptionally well executed and Alex sounds more focused than he has in years . If you were the Box Tops fan that I was -LRB- if you 're over 45 years old how could you not be -RRB- you owe it to yourself to get a copy of this new recording .
 As a fan of music from the 60 's , this CD takes me back to the Memphis scene , with a new enthusiam . It perfectly captures the feel of that era , with humor , and a soulful honesty . Alex rocks ! And it 's great to hear the Memphis Horns again .
 I just found this cd in the cutout bins . Man , what a pleasant surprise this album was ! In 1996 The Box Tops got back together after over 25 years apart for this reunion , and they play here like they 've never been apart . Alex Chilton sings with what seems like a renewed confidence in his voice , and belts these 14 tunes out like nobody 's bidness . Everything here is oldies stuff that ranges from rock n roll , to rockabilly , to rhythm and blues and soul . The album starts out and gets your attention quick with a very energetic version of `` Flyin ' Saucers Rock N Roll '' . They do a couple r & b tunes with `` I 'm In Love '' and `` Ai n't That A Lot Of Love '' , which sounds a lot like early Mitch Ryder . And speaking of Ryder , they do a very nice version of his song `` Little Latin Lupe Lu '' . Chilton gets down with his bad self and tries out some soul on `` Soothe Me '' , and the beautiful `` It Tears Me Up '' , where he really shows off some impressive tonsils . One of rockers on the album , and my favorite , is a very wicked version of `` Wang Dang Doodle '' . This song has never sounded this good to me before . And neither have the Box Tops . It 's great to see a band come back after this much time off , and not just go through the motions . These guys rock , and it 's obvious by the music on here , that they had a blast tearing up these oldies . I love this disc ! It has stayed in the number # 1 slot in the cd changer for a long time now , and does n't wannna leave . And for that reason alone , this merits 5 stars .
 These guys are having a ball doing what they believe in . What more could you ask for . It 's basic kick butt rock without slick production and synth tracks . They still got it . Hope another album comes out some tmie soon .
 i 'm a great fan of the box tops and search a very long time for a special song '' the door you close to me '' . i ca n't find this song of each cd . my question : have anybody this song for me as wave or mp3 file ? i 'm 52 years old DJ in germany and this song remember me for my first love '' marietta '' in the 60 's . danke !
 BOTH RE-ISSUES -LRB- CRY LIKE A BABY AND TEAR OFF -RRB- WERE EXCELLENT . I 'M ALWAYS SURPRISED THAT THIS BLUES/R & B GROUP DID N'T CHART MORE IN THEIR ERA . AS USUAL , THERE ARE DUPLICATIONS IN THE RE-ISSUES BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO ? I GIVE BOTH ALBUMS A FIVE-STAR . WHY DO YOU THINK THE BOXTOPS DID N'T CHART MORE OFTEN?BLUES / R & B
 The music on Disc 3 is snappy , upbeat and a pleasure for adults and children . I am a rock-n-roll fan but this is a cool disc . My wife and I will certainly locate and buy the remaining discs in this set .
 Our 23 month old daughter LOVES this set ! As soon as she gets into the car seat , she says , `` Play my music ?! '' She bobs her head happily and claps along joyfully . She really enjoys the animal sound effects and the children 's voices . She has the first cd memorized already and enjoys singing along to the different songs.Some parents may find some of the songs annoying , as some of the arrangements may not be as they remember . I tend to skip over some of the `` original '' songs -LRB- playing w/matches , strangers -RRB- , just because I think they sound too fun for such serious issues.Overall , this is a good purchase for your child . It brings out the kid in all of us !
 Since I became a new mom , I had bought several CDs of children 's songs for my baby . However , most of them are -LSB- weak -RSB- . So I did n't expect too much from this set of CDs . What a nice surprise , the Ultimate Kids Song Collection is by far my favorite as well as my 1 year old 's . Baby loves it and starts bouncing whenever I play the CDs . The set contains 3 CDs with 101 songs -LRB- over 3 hours of music -RRB- . This is quiet a bargain at around -LSB- $ $ -RSB- considering the great quality of recording . The performance by the Wonder Kids choir is superb . Also , the songs were recorded in split tracks so you can have karaoke style fun .
 i want to review kids songs
 Although beat and rhythm are emphasized , there are some wonderful melodies on here , and at least 3/4 are great for adults as well as children . We got this to go with a music class for our three-year-old , and he loves it , and so do we . The variety of singers helps each song feel unique . The opening `` hello '' song and the closing `` goodbye '' song are particularly wonderful .
 My two-year-old loves this CD , asking for it every day , and I 'm happy to play it for her . There 's only one song that I find annoying . On the whole it 's a good variety of easily singable songs and exercises to teach ear training . This Drum Song Collection focuses on drum accompaniments , but uses other instruments as well . We 're enjoying it .
 I had hoped for both the cd and the book for this song collection . This is only the cd -LRB- in a hard case -RRB- and it has 36 songs -LRB- the drum collection plus a few others from other collections -RRB- .
 I am a great fan of the entire Music Together CD series . My toddler derives great pleasure from listening to each and every one of them -LRB- i.e. Drum , Fiddle , Bongos , etc. -RRB- No matter which CD from the group , all of the songs are interactive , fun and an absolute joy to listen to . Lastly , some of the CD collection actually contains two CDs - one for home and one for the car ! Smart , educational and great fun !
 If you just started listening to Tiamat , circa Wildhoney or Deeper Kind of Slumber , and think that is Tiamat 's sound , you might as well just not even bother getting this album . However , if you 're into pure death metal that sounds like shards of glass being driven into your ears , this album is for you . The guitars are way beyond distorted , the drums keep the tempo at about 250 beats per minute and the vocals are lurched and vomited forth in speedy precision . Nothing against their other albums , I think they 're all great , but if you really want to hear Tiamat , pick up Summerian Cry .
 It 's a shame that this did n't really hit it big in the States , because this song is great ! The beat is great for dance and the singer has a wonderful voice . Give it a listen and I am sure that you 'll like it as much as I do . The Gorillaz are a fictional group made up of real artists . Their music is fresh and wonderful and gives a much needed injection of `` new '' to the current music scene . Give this one a listen !
 Amel , your voice and artestry keeps becoming more and more stronger on each new recording . From the writing to the production your merely flawless ... you make waking up in the morning amazing ... Thank you ...
 I wish she could sign with Motown or J Records and get some of the respect she deserves . While Britney and J. Lo are making headlines , she is making music . That effortless coloratura , she does everything but the Riperton-esque notes -LRB- and Trouble was close :--RRB- -RRB- . Maybe a hook-up with Quincy Jones or Stevie Wonder could have her become a SHINING STAR ...
 I love this cd . My favorite song is `` Gills and Tails . '' I have been following her music since she was with Groove Theory . True talent . She is soooooooooooo under rated . KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AMEL !!!!
 ` Morning ' is the dazzlingly eclectic third offering from Amel Larrieux , following her brilliant Neo Soul debut ` Infinite Possibilities ' , and it 's more acoustic -LRB- almost folk -RRB- / soul follow up ` Bravebird ' . It follows the path laid by that sophomore disc , further obliterating musical boundaries . It 's a real shame a brilliant CD like this is n't a smash hit but that 's record companies/radio for you.Cascading strings , shimmery piano , rich percussion , story telling lyrics , and intricate layering of her ethereal multi-range vocals best describes this CD.Opening track is the sunny , upbeat , largely acoustic and catchy ` Trouble ' . I love the scratchy guitar effects during the chorus . ` Unanswered question ' is a breezy piano sprinkled lite-jazz number . In a similar vein is the enchanting ` Gills and Tails ' , a metaphorical dive into the sea and one of my favourites . ` No one else ' is a gentle piano ballad , followed by the sparse mid tempo ` Earn my affection ' with deep retro sounding funky bassline and fleeting horns . Title track ` Morning ' is a lovely acoustic ballad with shimmery guitars giving it a folksy feel . ` Magic ' is a stripped down largely percussion driven almost monotonous affair , with backing vocals from her two kids towards the end , and lyrics about the hardships of everyday life . ` Just once ' is a funky affair telling about the uniqueness of every moment , and every person.The droning ` Mountain of when ' with clever cryptic lyrics , unobtrusive Eastern sounding instruments , and multi vocal layering , -LRB- sounding like lots of people speaking/singing/mumbling all at once -RRB- has a slight psychedelic feel to it . Great!Standout to me has got to be the lead off single , which is also the most radio friendly of the 10 tracks ; ` Weary ' . This song is awesome and has to be heard to be believed . With lyrics about being weary of being alone , set to rich percussion and instrumentation , excellent harmonizing , and a hugely passionate vocal delivery from Amel.Already one of the most outstanding releases this year in my book . If you like this , check out UK songstress Corinne Bailey Rae 's eponymous debut CD .
 One word to describe this album ? Incredible . She and Laru have produced , yet again , another masterpiece , that most of today 's music-listening audience will simply sleep on . I ca n't begin to tell you how affecting her music is . Just listen to the album , and you will be able to find a piece of yourself somewhere in each song . `` No One Else '' is a bonafide tearjerker for me and probably anyone else who has suffered the heartaches and heartbreak of love and have finally found their soulmate , the other half that romantically completes them . `` Just Once '' encourages us to keep on going and be ourselves no matter what , to live life as it comes , because hey , you only live once . `` Weary '' - My goodness . How many women can identify with the pure and precious words of this gorgeous song ? I have been blessed to be able to listen to and appreciate the best ! Amel and Laru have my undying respect , loyalty and affection . Much love to them ! DO N'T SLEEP ON THIS ONE ! WAKE UP ! IT 'S MORNING !!!
 After reading the other reviews , I felt I must put my 2 cents in with the rest of you all . I have all 3 of Amel 's solo releases , and each one seemed to grow on me with repeated listenings . On this release there is a song called `` no one else '' that absolutely grabbed me emotionally . I 'm a big Joni Mitchell fan and I do believe Amel 's done her homework by learning from the Lady of The Canyon . This cd also has `` morning '' and `` gills and tales '' , these are fantastic songs that I listen to over & over . I urge you to `` buy this CD '' , I bought it just seeing her name and picture on the cover . And I 'm Thrilled . Trust me , you 'll be glad you did . This girl 's a winner .
 i could n't wait to get my Morning c.d. i own all of her c.d. 's and i like all of them , but Morning is by far my favorite . she is a talented songstress as well as lyricist . the words to these songs touch me so deeply . Unanswered Questions , Earn my Affections , Weary , Trouble , Gills and Tails ; it 's like i 've been in all those places before . thank you for being so talented .
 I have been an AMEL fan from the beginning . This third solo project is the best yet . Each song is an extension of the next . I love her voice , the arrangements and the all around musicality . Beautiful from start to finish . Amel 's sound is a breath of fresh air among all the oh so common crap we are spoon feed by the major labels . Thank you Amel for not selling out !
 This is what we have all been waiting for , an album that we can treasure and feel through the depths of our soul.Amel is back , and she has shown the world that you do not need to be placed on a major label , to enlighten our hearts and souls.Standout tracks on this album are'Unanswered Question ' , ` Earn My Affections ' , ` Weary ' , ` Gills and Tails ' , and ` Mountain of When ' . For all you lovers out there that have ever been hurt and your one true love has gone without it being resolved , Unanswered Question is for you.This is def under the classification of Alternative Neo-Soul , but for all the many out there that appreciate a bit of spice with there soul , you will not be disappointed.Lets all have a bit of ` Trouble ' in our lives , and be enraptured by Amel 's mystical melodies .
 I 'm really glad to hear from her again . I absolutly loved her last album -LRB- Bravebird -RRB- which I still play constantly . This album is a little more eclectic than the last , but she 's an individual that does music her way and that 's what makes it so rewarding . She 's so good an artist , there 's no need to preview her work because I know it 's going to be good . I 've had `` Trouble '' on repeat since I had it , but overall it 's another exceptional work from Ms. Larrieux.Standout tracks : Trouble -LRB- My absolute favorite ... her voice sounds like a trumpet at the end . -RRB- Unanswered QuestionsWearyMagic -LRB- Her daughter sings backround -RRB- Gills & TailsMountain of WhenIf you 're a fan , you 'll be pleased to have this in your collection .
 I understand that many people found Amel 's last solo effort , `` Bravebird '' to be fanaminal , i could not get into the vibe of it.While there were some tracks that i really dug , mostly i was a little confused at with what path her sound veered of to.Her first solo album , `` Infinite Possibilities '' was just really amazing . This album , `` Morning '' really woke me up . . There are only ten tracks , but her first album had the same count . Its more about the impact of the songs rather the amount offered . There is no filler and every track stands on its own .
 Amel Larrieux is the definition of criminally underrated . She 's gotten plenty of love from the underground soul scene , but her flirtations with mainstream success have been fleeting . She signed with the major label Sony and released her first solo album Infinite Possibilities in 2000 , but was dropped 2 years later . After forming her own label Blisslife , she released the 2004 follow-up Bravebird and the lead single For Real was a moderate success . Then nothing . You ca n't keep a good woman down though.Amel 's 2006 record Morning strips away the ethereal jazz of her solo debut and expands on the acoustic setting of Bravebird . Trouble is a girlish , fizzy song about finding `` the one '' and the solemn piano-led Unanswered Question addresses pondering if letting go of an ex was wise or a mistake . `` Say you feel nothing when you see me/Say that where I walk flowers have grown/Say that I rocked your world/Say that I was never your girl/Just give me somethin' / Give me somethin' I can put in stone ! '' , she pleads . No One Else is another tender dedication to her hubby Laru that was also featured on the Why Did I Get Married soundtrack.The head bobber Earn My Affection calls for women to expect more from a man instead of accepting anything less than respect . `` You got to earn my affection/Put your back into it/Before we get this show on the road/Don ' t make me/Lose all my self respect/I ai n't desperate yet so/Come on now stop actin ' out and act like you know . '' Having to go through life without a love to call her own , Amel is Weary of `` singing this soldier song '' and wants a man `` to have my back and never do me wrong . '' `` This woman is growing weary/Of having to be so strong/Of having to pretend I 'm made of stone/So I wo n't end up with no broken bones/I ca n't fight every battle alone/I want someone to lift me/Heal my wounds and give me kisses on my head/Say words that should be said/Fear is not the matter/I would so much rather open up my heart/And lay down my guard . '' So relatable to anyone who 's able to hold things together in their work life , but yearn `` to go home to someone . `` Amel has said that she suffered from insomnia as a child and Morning reflects on her feeling like she was the only person alive while everyone else slept . The acoustic guitar strummings and murmuring vocals recall Tracy Chapman and Joni Mitchell as they start off softly distant , but gain power as the song goes on . Like the sun rising over the horizon.The imagery of Gills and Tails is original and captivating . Feeling like a `` small fish '' in a sea of sharks and other predators , Amel realizes she 's made a big mistake in believing she could keep her originality intact in the company of `` wannabes '' . `` I look up with longing at the surface/Hypnotized by the way the sunlight seems to ride each ripple/And they do a dance/Every ray becomes a beckoning hand/I miss the sweet taste of oxygen/I mistook this for the promised land ! '' The beautifully layered vocals and ocean deep rhythm create an intoxicating production . The bizzarely executed Magic with it 's random bleeps and buzzes advises those stressed out by lack of money and stacking bills to `` tap into your magic '' and boost your morale . Great advice during these times , econony wise.The golden brown bliss of Just Once throws self-consciousness and insecurity to the wind and reminds us that `` every hour/Every minute/Every moment , happens just once/Every human/Every being/Every lifetime , happens just once ! '' So do n't feel down because you 're not like everyone else . Bask in your individuality and go for your dreams . The last track Mountain of When sums up Amel 's constant struggle for a chance to gain more exposure . God knows she deserves it !
 `` Morning '' is one of Larrieux 's best albums , in my opinion . I 'm surprised that some reviewers called her a dime-a-dozen singer , and said this album is overproduced . She 's one of the few singers I 'd call an artist since she produces , writes and sings her own material . I just do n't hear any overproduction on this album , since the music has such an abstract feel in some songs , and organic quality -LRB- favoring piano , drum , and guitar arrangements -RRB- on others . Plus , Amel does n't get as much press as other singers -LRB- since her departure from Groove Theory . -RRB- Music on `` Morning '' is more introspective , and is n't really meant to be danced to , in my opinion . -LRB- Some may disagree . -RRB- To me , this is a psychological exploration of the painful challenges -LRB- with self esteem , trust , relationships and dreams -RRB- facing women . The music is abstract , but good , in my opinion . I listen to this album whenever I 'm facing challenges in my own life or relationships with others.The reason why I like Larrieux is that not only is she a talented singer with a lovely voice ; she 's also a great songwriter , adept at creating imagery/allegories that explore deeper themes -LRB- `` Gills and Tails '' is one example -RRB- . I ca n't overstate how rare that ability is these days for many songwriters . `` Trouble '' is just a fun song about love at first sight . In `` Unanswered Questions '' , she explores unrequited love , and what could have been if it fully matured . `` Gills and Tails '' is a beautiful song , one of my favorites on the album , along with `` Earn my Affections '' which should be an anthem for any woman entering into a relationship . `` Magic '' is about reconnecting with your inner spark to get your life and dreams back on track . -LRB- Others may disagree . -RRB- Overall , a great effort .
 This cd is truly Amel 's best so far . She incorporates all genres and makes it all her own unique style . A mellow , smooth groove with a feel good and conscious vibe . If you like funk , soul , twang , with a bit of Hip-Hop Soul , this is the cd for you . You will not be disapointed!There is n't just one song that stands out , the entire cd is phenomenal ! From the vocal arrangements , beats , lyrics , this cd will be an R&B classic !
 My husband and I have the whole `` Amel Collection '' -- from Groove Theory to the solo efforts . And while I do n't love every song equally , as a whole ... it 's great ! For me , the standout tracks are `` Unanswered Question , `` Weary , '' `` Morning , '' and `` Gills & Tails . `` If you 're a fan of hers , I do n't think you 'll be dissapointed !
 I absolutely loved her last album -LRB- Brave bird -RRB- which I still play constantly . Her latest effort , `` Morning '' , seems more of a departure from her previous jazz-inflected albums , but at the very least , it succeeds in showcasing Amel 's impressive vocal range . In fact , vocally , she 's stronger than ever . But unfortunately for her fans , `` Morning '' is an album that is less an R&B ; / soul groove , and folksier - a la Ani Difranco -LRB- whom I like -RRB- and perhaps even a little bit like a happier version of Fiona Apple -LRB- whom I love -RRB- . Whatever dry spell the `` neo-soul '' genre is going through , it really needs to break free from . That 's why I 'll continue to support artists like Amel , Jill Scott , Musiq Soul Child , Van Hunt and Anthony Hamilton , for at least remaining a consistent force in the game and bringing something fresh to the table.Standout tracks : Trouble -LRB- My absolute favorite ... her voice sounds like a trumpet at the end . -RRB- Unanswered QuestionsWearyMagic -LRB- Her daughter sings backround -RRB- Gills & TailsMountain of When
 From the moment you press play , you wo n't be able to stop yourself from replaying Amel Larrieux 's new album Morning . Beats and melodies only unique enough to be written by Amel and husband Laru , can be heard throughout the album . Songs like Weary , Gils and tails , Magic , and countless others make this album more than expected . But then again , you know if Amel is singing it 's going to be great . So , if you like good music , and love to be treated , buy Morning .
 I 'm glad to exist in a world where Amel Larrieux puts out music . The times that I feel compled to buy a CD have been far an few between for the last few years . However , being an Amel fan since the Grove Theory album , I knew `` Morning '' would be a welcome addition to my collection . She did not disappoint , picking up right where `` BraveBird '' left off . In addition to the vocals , I really enjoy the production on the album , as every track seems to complement the next . `` Unanswered Questions '' , `` No One Else '' , `` Morning '' and `` Gills & Tails '' are standout songs , but the whole album works . Highly Recommended for those who feel there collection has become stagnant lately from lack of options !!!!
 What a beautiful offering from soul/folk singer Amel Larrieux . Although I was n't a big fan of Groove Theory 's and did n't purchase Amel 's solo debut , Amel made a lifelong fan out of me with Bravebird and this follow up does not disappoint . Although I do n't love every song on the album , the songs I do like are so powerful that I listen to the cd daily and never tire of it . Trouble is fun with a light feel to it . Unanswered Question speaks to anyone who has ever wondered how the person they loved felt about them in return . No One Else is a beautiful , self-explanatory ballad and Morning has a soothing tone . Weary is the most commercial song on the album and it is wonderful as well but my absolute favorites are the understated Gills and Tails , and the hauntingly beautiful Mountain of When . If you are a fan of Amel 's , the only thing that will disappoint you about this CD is that there just is n't enough of it !
 My mother loved Groove Theory but I first heard of Larrieux from her song `` Get Up '' from the `` Infinite Possibilities '' album . I was interested enough to check out her three solo albums which included this and `` Bravebird '' . While no song matches `` Get Up '' -LRB- even though `` For Real '' is really nice -RRB- , the subsequent albums since the first were better in quality . While `` Bravebird '' is really good , this album was more enjoyable . From the first track , `` Trouble '' to the last `` Mountains of When '' , the album really holds up throughout . The highlights would be her first single , groovy `` Weary '' , gorgeous `` Gills and Tails '' , fun and bouncy `` Trouble '' , uplifting `` Just Once '' , and the thoughtful `` Mountains of When '' . She 's really talented and I hope she will get more recognition . This release while independent , sounded much better than most mainstream R&B releases released that year .
 Since the `` Groove Theory '' days , I have always had a thing for Amel 's sultry , soft sound , and til ' this day , I STILL say Amel '' TELL ME IF YOU WANT ME TOO '' ? Because I will never stop wanting more . Kepp up the excellent music coming . Your devoted minion ...
 What a breath of fresh air this album is to me ! I truly appreciate the simple elegance that this artist possesses . Larrieux 's sound is a mixture of Sade , Tracy Chapman , and Teedra Moses . Her vocals are sweet , contemplative , probing , and ethereal.It 's no wonder she reminds me of Sade since she sung on Sweetback 's -LRB- Sade 's back-up band -RRB- self-titled debut . Larrieux had an ear for unusual harmonies and a penchant for quirky story-telling . A review I read described her songs as poetry put to music , and I totally agree . Today 's R&B ; chicks ca n't hold a candle to her .1 . Trouble - Cute , sing-song verses and chorus . Check out her scatting at the very end of the song . R&B ; chicks take note .2 . Unanswered Question - Nice brooding contemplation of wondering if `` I was your one that got away . `` 3 . `` No One Else '' - Sweet , simple lyrics , lilting piano .4 . Earn My Affections - Every single woman needs to memorize this song . Do n't give it up so easily , ladies . Make him `` put -LSB- his -RSB- back into it . `` 5 . Weary - The most commercial sounding song on this album basically about having a love that makes you strong instead of weak .6 . Morning - This song had to grow on me , but I love the moodiness of it and the stripped down tone .7 . Gills & Tails - Absolutely my favorite song on this CD . It just has the most melodic tone with beautiful and poetic imagery
 I LOVE this CD , I think it 's some of her best work yet ! The lyrics are remarkably on point . I have worn the grooves out of weary , I call it an `` independent woman 's anthem '' , Truth at it 's finest !
 I am so impressed with Amel 's new album . I love every song on the album . The best song is clearly `` Weary '' and my other favorites are `` Earn My Effections '' and `` Gills and Tails '' . This album is just as good , if not , better than `` Bravebird '' . Just because you may not of heard of Amel , does n't mean she 's not good . She 's one of the most underatted artist in the R&B industry . She deserves so much more credit .
 With this being her 3rd solo album Amel is getting better and better with time ! Her lyrics are insightful , her vocals are mesmerizing , and the production is excellent . I must give high regards to individuals that decide to go out on their on for a more `` Bliss `` ful existence . Amel and Laru have put together 2 previous albums and this one is equally engaging . As a fellow Amel fan said earlier , the only bad thing is that the CD only has 10 songs but once you 're done listening to them you can only imagine and anticipate what 's to come !
 If you love neo soul you will truly enjoy this album . Trouble : Gills and Tales
 Oh man what an album ! It may even be better than her last one -LRB- Bravebird -RRB- . The album starts out with `` Trouble '' which is one of the best songs on the album , and then slides to `` Unanswered Question '' which is almost as up-tempo and good . '' ` No One Else ' '' is a slow-moving song built on a beautiful piano and shows off Amel 's gorgeous vocals . The beef of the album lies in the middle and the stretch from `` Earn My Affections '' to `` Magic '' is amazing !!! The album might be a little short but the 10 strong songs will surely keep me happy for a long , long time . This will definately be the best R&B ; album released this year , and probobly one of the best albums released . I am very impressed!Best Songs
 I hate the way record companies use the cookie-cutter approach to backing/promoting artists , i.e. if it worked for one artist then the rest must sound really similar . Amel Larrieux has been a breath of fresh air to me and she has been criminally underrated . This cd has not altered my opinion one bit . The imagery of `` Gills and Tails '' was literally ` breath-taking ' . `` Weary '' should be my own personal anthem because it was like Amel was walking around in my brain . Her work sometimes seems to be a throw-back to another time and at other times it seems futuristic . I heard `` Bravebird '' one day and was intrigued by this woman . I went and found her previous cd `` Infinite Possibilities '' and anxiously awaited the release of `` Morning '' . I have yet to be disappointed . If you 're solely interested in top-forty music , Amel is not for you . However , if you 're looking for music that moves , is familiar and foreign at the same time , give Ms. Larrieux a listen . No cookie-cutter here !
 Amel Larrieux IS my FAVORITE artist ! Naturally , when I heard her third album would be released on April 25th , I had to purchase it immediately . Her music , especially this album is always tranquil , purposeful , it has a silent humbleness , yet a strong boldness . It is sweet and genuine , even the harmonies contain this vivid magnetism . She is an awesome artist , a seemingly humble person and an incredible performer ! My favorite song on this album , besides , `` Weary , '' is the first track , `` Trouble . '' Please purchase all of Amel 's Albums . . one , two , and three , your SOUL album collection is not complete wthout them!PEACE
 She has never sounded better . I 'd been awaiting this album , though I was n't in love with either of her previous solo albums . But I caught her vh1 soul `` Listening Party '' and I have to say after hearing how Amel speaks about music , I feel her soul was captured on Morning . The arrangements are fresh , her voice does n't get lost or overpower the music , the lyrics are thoughtful and elegant . Oh her voice is such a gift . It 's all uplifting.And the album is perfectly titled - something to wake up to and carry with you throughout your day .
 Ok , this is just the album that I have been waiting for !!!! Finally an album that takes music to an entirely different level and although it is far too advanced for some -LRB- i.e. , the people who rated this album with 2 and 3 stars -RRB- , they should probably go back , open their ears and take a second - and if they are n't too swift - third listen . This album is genius at it 's climax . Every track is just necessary , a `` tight 10 song set '' , an ode to reinventing soul music as we know it.This album just proves that you do n't have to fit a mold to be be good , you can get out of the mold and be extraordinary . Definitely the best CD release of 2006 so far and it will be on repeat in my CD player for months and months and months to come . If you are tired of the repetitive music on the radio ... `` Morning '' will definitely make your day !
 I know I 'm behind on this one and sadly I 've owned it for awhile but it 's `` magic '' finally sank in . I think that I was so taken by ` Bravebird ' , the less than varied arrangements threw me off . However , that was before I really listened to it and found this album to be just as brilliant if not better than it 's predecessor . While the tempo pretty much stays at a crawl it 's the subtleties that truly make this . The steady beats seem hypnotic , giving Amel all the room she needs to stretch or whisper -LRB- just put some headphones on and you 'll hear things you did n't notice the first time around -RRB- over sonic meditations . I think `` Weary '' is the only song that sounds `` radio friendly '' but that 's not bad by any means . The contemplative `` Unanswered Questions '' is pretty heavy with it 's sedate tempo and looped drum rolls . The folky title track 's acoustic guitar brings to mind Joni Mitchell . The real highlight is the track `` Gills and Tails '' with its stand up bass line and endearing lyrics that serve as metaphor for those who struggle to retain honesty and integrity vs. the `` go for yours '' mentality whether you be lovers , politicians , corporate thiefs in a suit and tie ... it 's pretty universal.My fascination lies with the two more left-field pieces `` Magic '' and `` Mountain Of When '' . Both take me back to her collaborations with Sweetback -LRB- check `` Gaze '' -RRB- . These are the tracks Sweetback should have made for their `` Stage 2 '' full length . It 's because of these tracks the LP shows promise and willingness to experiment sonically with textures and sounds . Amel 's a pretty amazing vocalist and while she does n't hit any Minnie Riperton notes like she did on `` For Real '' , it proves that real strength is sometimes shown in restraint . Great album Amel !
 This girl is cold blooded Man cant believe some of the things some people were saying it got to me so i had to say somthing if you listen to her music cop this man and then pick up lina the neo soul one not that other lina hey the black lina
 This is an excellent CD . Amel 's vocals are amazing and the maturation can definitely be heard . The only complaint I have is that the CD is waaaayyy too short , especially for an Amel fan like myself . Nonetheless , this is a great CD . Stay true to yourself Mel . Highly recommend .
 As she stated on her record label 's website at blisslife.com , `` I 'm writing songs for other people right now and not only thinking of myself . '' I believe Amel knows someone else out there is going through every song she sings . I know I was touched and can relate to every song , like she 's digging up my past and telling me to look optimistically toward the future . Yes she 's beautiful and has a voice as pure as ever . But over all she 's basically got her testimony to spread to us , helping us to remember we can get through ANYTHING and that joy does come in the MORNING .
 Amel 's smooth vocals and beautiful lyrics are incredible ! She is such an underrated artist . This cd will definitely stay in rotation !
 This album is one I could listen to at anytime . Her voice itself is an instrument that does n't need backup or music but on this album the combination produces magic . Simply put , Amel Larrieux sings beautifully , her lyrics are simple but so profound and if you want music that will transport you somewhere transcendental , make this a part of your collection .
 Amel Larrieux is quite possibly the most underrated artist of this time period and `` Morning '' simply adds to her impressive resume . This CD is solid , from first to last note and fans who have appreciated her positive energy will appreciate what this album offers . `` Trouble '' is a fun , French infused jazzy song about declaring affinity towards a man . `` No One Else '' is a sweet , soft follow up to her popular love song `` Make Me Whole '' from Infinite Possibilities.Step away from all the hugs and kisses and behold inspiring songs such as the title track `` Morning '' , `` Magic '' and the solemn `` Gills & Tails '' . This album is worth every penny but even more significant is that you 'll be supporting a real artist who cares about her craft , who cares about spreading positive messages into a world full of scarred souls , who decided to skip the mainstream route to explore the depths of her heart & soul.Please note
 As always , this Amel CD is right at home in the `` Soul '' section of the music store . It 's not quite at the same level as Bravebird , her previous release , but it 's very good . After you listen to Amel 's CDs , you 're bound to be more relaxed and a bit happier . This album is n't quite as deep , per se , as Bravebird , but it still sounds wonderful.My favorite song is the title track , a very smooth R&B ; tune . `` Trouble '' is a fun song with which to start the CD , and `` Earn My Affection '' is upbeat and soulful . `` Weary '' is another real , melodic song . If you like Amel and you like true R&B ; music , while this CD may not end up in your top 10 of all-time , you will be glad you bought it .
 I do n't know how to write a review on this album . It is simply just a beautiful album from start to finish.I recommend to anyone .
 I would rate this at 3.5 but there is no half so I am rounding up , great album , though Bravebird was better . The style of both the beats and lyrics have somewhat changed from her older stuff . Not in a bad way however , it is just a different vibe . I say have of the album is great , 3/5 is good and 2/5 I was n't feeling but none of it is ` bad ' . She is a great artist , she brings more substance than most of the people out there . I like to think that there is no one to compare her to , she is original and that is why I am such a big fan.If you do n't own anything by here , get the first two albums too . They are well worth it .
 It 's a little puzzling as to why there are two substanially different versions for the UK and US release of Unfinished Business . While this is the more generous collection -LRB- with 13 additional tracks -RRB- it is missing key tracks from the US version as well.Still , it would n't be a Kinks related album if there was n't business problems and inconsistency . This album actually merits 4 1/2 stars only because it 's missing some key tracks from the US version -LRB- the US version only gets 41/2 for the same reason -RRB- . With Velvel -LRB- the US distributor -RRB- in financial trouble , it might be wise to pick up the US version in addition to this simply because it may not be available for too much longer .
 I acquired this CD after hearing the same from my partner in the firm . What initially drew my undivided attention , or rather sense of hearing , was the dark tone playing of two Chorale pieces by Kempff at the beginning of the CD . The sound was so somber and ritualistic , as you would expect from an organ instead of piano . I have a complete set of Beethoven 's piano sonatas performed by the same artist , but this dark tinged performance indeed opened a new window , at least for me , to Kempff 's mastery of piano as a keyboard instrument.As mentioned in the title , all the pieces in this compilation are transcriptions from well known , most famous but less `` heavy '' works by Bach . However , Kempff 's approach not only brought out the beauty of Bach 's melodies , but also the clarity of counterpoints , the pedantic and learned aspect of the great master and lawgiver of the music theory . Thus , this CD suits both the academic and lighthearted.As a final note , tt is worth to add that the minuet by Handel and two episodes from the ballet music of `` Orfeo ed Euridice '' are real rarities in the repertory and additional gems in this little , but precious jewel box .
 The more Kempff I hear , the more I appreciate his vast talents . This fine disc contains some of the most beautifully played piano music you will hear . I 've been listening to a lot of Richter 's Bach lately , which I thoroughly enjoy , especially his WTC & the English and French Suites . The two suites included on this disc are the polar opposite of Richter , but every bit as enjoyable , perhaps more so .
 I very much love the music , but did have a couple of spots on the CD where the sound of the music overpowered the person singing . Just love the music , so I overlooked the small mistakes .
 I love Maria . I do . This album is recommended for one reason . SHe actually talks on the album . This is something she has not done very often in her live shows of recent . The songs are not for those who do not like her last two efforts ... BUT ... BUT ... I think they come off much better live than on a studio record . Maria is a live performer . Her strength and joy lies there . It shows on this record . The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 is the lack of diversity in the songs .
 Maria shows up strong as a live solo artist in this recording , and her humor comes through as well ... I 'd give up 90 % of my collection -LRB- at least -RRB- if forced to choose between Live in Hamburg and the rest . You 'll listen to it often , I guarantee . WHY is maria McKee not a worldwide superstar ? WHY did David Geffen screw up her solo albums -LRB- here & there - overproduction -RRB- ... ? Well THIS one bears no Geffen stamp and is impeccable .
 ... but I like it . It is not overly `` cleaned up . '' You feel like you are there . At times , kinda a train-wreck , but that 's part of the uniqueness of it . I like it .
 Good buy , well worth while . If you like Blues this is a great recording.I strongly recomend it . realy a pleasure to listen .
 Enjoy two hilarious Jamaican folktales about Anansi the spider . While Anansi is teeny-tiny , his boasts are as tall as tales get . You 'll be intrigued by this hip spider and carried away by the captivating rhythms of the West Indies . The video won the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Gold Award , and the Parent 's Choice Gold Award . Told by Denzel Washington , Music by UB40 . ALL of the Rabbit Ears recordings are treasures !
 This is a great CD . Love hearing Denzel read . The Anansi stories are so great.My granddaughter loves it . I was so happy to find it on Amazon .
 It is a wonderful thing when I find a children 's CD that I enjoy as much as the kids . This is a family road trip favorite ! Denzel Wahington does an excellent job of narration , the music is great and the story itself is refreshingly different and well told . Just like the other reviewer I love all of the Rabbit Ears CDs , but this one is particularly good . -LRB- WARNING !

Well , this is one of the wildest & weirdest jazz records of the period it was made -- or ANY period for that matter ! Check it out -- even if you 've never heard of Raymond Scott -- it 's a 1-of-a-kind album ! I wish I could give this CD reissue 7-stars -- 1 for each of it 's exotic secrets ! _

'' With this group of top jazz musicians he recorded THE UNEXPECTED album in January of 1960 . For nearly 45 years the identity of the Secret Seven line-up has remained a mystery , but now you can learn the identity of Raymond Scott 's all-star jazz band by visiting a `` secret '' webpage whose location is revealed in the CD booklet ... This is another CD in Basta 's Essential Reissue series , complete with original liner notes , cover artwork , and a newly-prepared booklet featuring historical info and previously unpublished photos ...

 . `` A weird and wonderful jazz record . An extraordinary release in many ways , even for RAYMOND SCOTT . Some pieces are worthy of Scott 's earlier Raymond Scott Quintet literature , which for many remains his stylistic hallmark . These pieces generally tend to be more complex , ambitious and yet shorter than his earlier works . You really need to listen at least a couple of times to figure out what is going on . But once you 've got a grip on THE UNEXPECTED its virtues become obvious . '' -- David Lewis , ALL MUSIC GUIDE .
 Neutronic is a new band to me , and although it is different music from what I normally listen to , it stands out . The lack of lyrics is a VERY nice change from the norm , and this album maintains a catchy beat the whole way through . Enough said , if you can find a copy of this album , I 'd buy it !
 The music on this cd is an awesum mixture of tech . and electronic noises ... it is extreamly futuristic and very inspiring ... the band seems to be intouch with their technological side and love it too because this music raves out the feeling of pure tech with kick to the head !!! ...
 OK , I did n't buy this from Amazon , I came across it a few days ago in a New York City used CD store . I had never heard of any of the lead singers , although one of the maids is Marie Collier . Everything about this CD surprised me . The lead singers are surprisingly good , for never having heard them , or even heard of them before they were very good . Did they not sing these roles more than just the one time here ? Overall I liked the conducting , Lammers takes surprisingly few cuts . However Lammers ' singing always seemed a little rushed to me and she did disappear into the orchasrta at `` der jauchz '' but still , overall , it 's a fine performance . Hedwig Muller-Butow is quite good as Chrysothemis , Georgina von Milinkovic is an acceptable Klytamnestra . The photos of the production look really good , it looked like these singers could act , and if so this would have been a great performances for those 's attending . This unknown CD definitely belongs in any Elektra collection Once you see the photos you know what 's coming up is going to be good , or at least interesting . The libretto is in full -LRB- German and English -RRB- and has lot 's of extras , including more photos of the production , AND there is a 14 minute interview on the CD to listen to , I 've never seen that before , I would have loved to have a 14 minute interview with Solti at the end of his recording . The sound quality has been cleaned up well but it 's not the best live performance re-master I 've heard . But for the Elektra fan that has is all this will make for a nice interesting evening !!!
 I am very pleased with my purchase . I am on a roll collecting the best Electras .
 The music on Disc 3 is snappy , upbeat and a pleasure for adults and children . I am a rock-n-roll fan but this is a cool disc . My wife and I will certainly locate and buy the remaining discs in this set .
 Our 23 month old daughter LOVES this set ! As soon as she gets into the car seat , she says , `` Play my music ?! '' She bobs her head happily and claps along joyfully . She really enjoys the animal sound effects and the children 's voices . She has the first cd memorized already and enjoys singing along to the different songs.Some parents may find some of the songs annoying , as some of the arrangements may not be as they remember . I tend to skip over some of the `` original '' songs -LRB- playing w/matches , strangers -RRB- , just because I think they sound too fun for such serious issues.Overall , this is a good purchase for your child . It brings out the kid in all of us !
 Since I became a new mom , I had bought several CDs of children 's songs for my baby . However , most of them are -LSB- weak -RSB- . So I did n't expect too much from this set of CDs . What a nice surprise , the Ultimate Kids Song Collection is by far my favorite as well as my 1 year old 's . Baby loves it and starts bouncing whenever I play the CDs . The set contains 3 CDs with 101 songs -LRB- over 3 hours of music -RRB- . This is quiet a bargain at around -LSB- $ $ -RSB- considering the great quality of recording . The performance by the Wonder Kids choir is superb . Also , the songs were recorded in split tracks so you can have karaoke style fun .
 i want to review kids songs
 I know I 'm not the best reviewer , but I 'll try . Basically , in my opinion , anything that is Tenchi Muyo ! is great . That also includes this CD . I think that it should be an addition to anyone 's collection . The music is great . It would be a waste if you did n't get this . Just take my word for it . This CD is worth your money . There are some songs that annoy me , and some songs that I really like . But like I said , THIS CD IS WORTH GETTING !
 You will not regret this purchase . Like the movie . . the music gently plays w / the senses . Great to relax to .
 This CD is great if you 're a fan of the Tenchi Universe series . I highly reccomend it .
 It 's one of the best I 've heard in awhile it does it 's Anime justice
 Beautiful CD ... it has the full versions of the intro and closing songs on it -LRB- just what i have been waiting for ! -RRB-
 Once more we have the admirable and peerless phrasing of one of the most imaginative exponents of the pianism in any age . Not only the cantabile line , but the construction of a solid perspective that reaffirms the concept so may times expressed in the sense of creating an atmosphere around the player . As Richter stated once . `` All performer must become an invisible link between the composer and audience or listener and so he must vanish in order to do that aim . `` Kempff ` s refulgent musicality and profundity of thought is carved in relief in this memorable CD . It 's time for you in case you do n't , to get close the anima of this singular pianist . One of the supreme giants of the keyboard ever born
 Recorded shortly before Kempff retired , there is a refulgent stillness to this recital . One can not imagine these pieces being played in such a fashion at Carnegie Hall ; the likes of Lang Lang would be dumbfounded . Here , the octogenarian seems to be addressing God or the ghost of Johann Sebastian Bach or perhaps the youth he once was who was swept away by Democritus ' river.The Preludes and Fugues merge seamlessly into the one meditation on Eternity . The Capriccio on the Departure of a Beloved Brother is one of JSB 's most poignant creations - but unlike the Farewell Symphony , the Beloved returns home . All is good.The recital ends memorably
 Borknagar 's first album is all in Norwegian , which is cool because you ca n't understand a word they 're saying if you do n't speak the language . So , for anyone who 's easily offended by lyrics , no worries mate ! Of course , Borknagar 's material supposedly deals with nature , which is a topic I like to hear about , so I ca n't understand how you would be . Anyway , if you started listening to Borknagar with Quintessence or Empiricism , this is vastly different , but gives a hint as to where the music would eventually go . It 's not underground black metal void of synths or rhythm ; the production is n't great but is n't as bad as some reviewers are saying , and is much better than early Emperor . The guitar work is excellent ; Garm 's vocals are good , but probably the worst of the three vocalists the band has been through over the course of its existence ; and in typical black metal fashion , the drums really stand out . This is melodic metal , so do n't expect anything brutal or evil . It 's just plain good music . Get it now before they run out of copies . I hear it 's out of production and will not be available much longer , but I do n't know how true that is .
 This is Borknagar 's first release and probably their most raw one . The guitars played by Ivar Bjornsson from Enslaved and Oystein Brun comprise a wall of distorted electric mayhem on some tracks and on other tracks acoustic guitar passages with heavy Scandinavian folk influence are played . There are quite a few instrumentals on this album but they all fit perfectly into the song sequence and are very folkish and emotional passages . The bass work by Infernus is excellent and actually audible a lot of the time above the chaotic drone of guitars which is quite unusual for a black metal release . Despite this being their first release , the music is quite complex and very impressive , owing a lot to the legendary Garm of Ulver fame who does all the harsh vocal rasps and growls on this disc . There are almost no clean vocals on this album , unlike the rest of Borknagar 's releases . There are great folkish choirs on some of the tracks which add greatly to the cold northern atmosphere . The drumming is fast but not standard black metal blasting and has good variety to complement the music , all the drums are handled by the late Grim who committed suicide in 1999 . RIP Erik , your contribution will live on . Overall an awesome release from one of the masters of the genre . This is the way true Norwegian black metal was and should be played . Period .
 This CD has the ferocity of Ulver -LRB- alot due to Garms vocals and some perfect blast beats -RRB- with the epics of Hammerheart . In other words , it is classic . It is dark viking black metal , very violent and very epic .
 This is BORKNAGAR at their best . This is a rawer , harsher sound than the more recent albums . The music is harder , faster and violent sounding , I guess they were trying to capture that Viking rage . Searing guitar , blasting drumming and abrasive vokills -LRB- provided by none other than GARM -RRB- . Their songs even have an epic structure and feel to them . A must have for BLACK METAL FANS .
 Ok , so the production is not near as pretty as it is on the other two albums . All the lyrics are in Norwegian , so I dont understand most of it , but I have an idea . Half of the songs are intrumentals . Believe me ... this record is much more `` raw '' then the other nicely produced albums , this one is actually BLACK METAL . This is for the true Borknagar fans , if you are only fimilair with the latest recording this one will surprise you ! Its defintaly worth the cost if you are into rusty metal viking music ???? I dont know exactly , do not trust me ...
 this along with the olden domain is Borknagar at their best . true nordic black metal with raw production and plenty of hatred .

 Wha ?!?! there are no reviews for this either ? more awesomeness from mike of godheadsilo and company . enemymine tends to sound more metal to me than godhead did , but still maintains powerful and catchy songs . ` dent everything ' should have been playing on mtv , man ... they were in Washington at the time , how 'd they miss these guys !? get this album for the fifty cents or dollar it costs on here and while you 're at it get their other album ` the ice in me ' -- also incredible ...
 Considering that Enemymine is the work of Zack Sally , Danny Sasaki and Mike Kunka you might wonder how a double bass - one drummer band works . The answer is heavy and quite well . This EP contains my favorite song by Enemymine
 On the underground music labels of the UK , Sway proves his talent as not only a rapper , but an icon for British urban music , going out of his way to produce uplifting bright songs such as Little Derek , and keep to pop-cultured yet meaningful genres on garage-styled beats such as on the hit Flo ' Fashion . With the mentioned songs and Products , Up Your Speed and On My Own as mentionables , and many good and decent songs to fill , this is truly worth the money you 're spending . If you like this , please look-in to the diverse British urban scene , as there are many young artists with much talent . - Sumil Thakrar
 right right .1 of the best of 2006 , & not even an official album , a demo . sway uk 's new hot boy , so hot even mtv you hear it first had to rep when he won the mobo award over 50 cent & the game with a demo , dame you know then dis is bangin . he also has 2 other albums called this is my promo I & II with some songs from demo but some new ones , but very hard to find , not as good as demo but still amazing & has to be heard . i thought every song was bangin no skipable tracks but little derek was 3stars . if your familiar with uk hip hop this is no different , from the country that has always pushed the envelope , the beats are very electronic like rap beats not sample backpack style . he 's not as prolific as roots manuva , rodney p or loteck but deffinetelly in the ranks , give him a few years , but any fans of dem will love this just da same . rep uk fa life
 This is one great CD . I just got it a couple of days ago , but I 'm so psyched about it . This guy is absolutely great . I like how Sway incorporates more techno-ish sounding beats . My favorite track is Hype Boys , which I first heard while playing Need for Speed Carbon . My favorite thing about Sway is how he goes against the grain in every way possible . He 's against the gangsta scene in rap -LRB- which quite frankly , I 'm getting really sick of -RRB- , and he 's also against various other social problems within our society today . He also is the first rapper -LRB- at least in the UK -RRB- to outdo all of the contracted rappers with simple mixes -LRB- by simple , I mean not professionally contracted , altered , etc. -RRB- . Great album . If you do n't have it , get it !
 SWAY IS AMAZING , THE ALBUM THIS IS MY DEMO IS ACTUALLY RELEASED THROUGH DYSHPA PRODUCTIONS , WHICH IS SWAYS COMPANY AND HE WAS IN BUSINESS WITH BIG * ALLIENCE RECORDS RELESED IN COURTESY OF ALL CITY MUSIC BECAUSE SWAY IS UNSIGNED , HE HAS NEVER HAD A RECORD DEAL BECAUSE WHAT LABELS CAN OFFER HIM , AINT ENOUGH AS TO WHAT HE CAN DO FOR HIMSELF , I SWEAR DOWN , CHECK THE WEBSITE ABOUT THIS MAN . . BRUV I SWEAR TO YOU , YOU 'LL BE SO DISAPOINTD IN YOURSELF IF YOU DONT GET THIS.BRAP . SAFE
 I bought this CD and am amazed at how great it is . I ca n't stop listening to it . I 'm american and I like most of sways music better than ours . For anyone who is a big fity cent or Game fan this is something you must buy ! , you may never listen to fifty or game again . I promise every track is worth the money you have.Hope sway keeps rapping this well and that he starts to collaborate with some american rappers . I think he could really change hip-hop for the better .
 Ah , John Charles Thomas ; when will hear the likes of his voice again ! Thomas -LRB- 1891-1960 -RRB- was Broadway , opera , recording , and radio star who is relatively unknown to those born after 1945 . Luckily , this recording is a excellent example of his style , his muscianship , and his magnificent voice . Enjoy the sheer exhurberance of `` Open Road '' and `` Largo al Factotem '' ; the power of `` Di Provenza . . '' , the fun of `` The Last Time I Saw Paris '' and the beauty of `` Home on the Range '' -LRB- a song he introduced that became his theme song . -RRB- Sadly , this album does not include any gospel hymns which were his specialty . Somewhere in the RCA archives is his recording of `` Softly and Tenderly '' which we can all look forward to in -LRB- hopefully -RRB- another future release of John Charles Thomas ' recordings .
 I bought this for my mother and father who love the Open Road song in the car advert , but had never heard of this gentleman . This CD has been a huge success with them .
 Though apparently remembered only by the devotees of the Collector 's Corner , Mischa Elman was one of the great fiddlers of the 20th century . Born near Kiev in 1891 in a Jewish family -LRB- ten years before Heifetz -RRB- and a child prodigy , he was trained first in Odessa , then in St Petersburg with the famous pedagogue Leopold Auer , teacher of such other violin luminaries as Heifetz , Milstein and Zimbalist . Elman later moved to the United States , and became an American citizen in 1923 - soon followed by Heifetz and Auer . The rising star of Heifetz , with his cooler , more `` objective '' and virtuosic style , somewhat nudged Elman out of the limelight of his earlier American years , but he was active until his death in 1967 . This program of Hebrew Melodies harks back then to Elman 's early childhood years in Jewish Ukraine . As the previous commentator has remarked , in addition to the 9 Hebrew melodies the CD contains four additional and uncredited items . Strangely , access is denied from both websites indicated on the CD 's back cover , so that 's not were you are going to find the information missing on the CD 's booklet.The new CD actually reproduces the contents of an earlier Vanguard CD , OVC 8030 , published in 1992 and more appropriately called `` Mischa Elman Collection Volume 3 , Hebraic & Russian Melodies '' -LRB- Hebraic & Russian Melodies -RRB- . The 9 Hebrew Melodies were recorded in 1962 and had two LP appearances , as Vanguard VRS 1099 and VSD 2137 . The four uncredited pieces are -LRB- in the CD order -RRB- Joseph Sulzer 's Sarabande , Cesar Espejo Airs Tziganes Op. 11 , Melodie from Tchaikovsky 's Souvenir d'un lieu cher Op. 42 No. 3 and Danse russe from Morceaux for Piano Op. 40 . Tchaikovsky 's Melodie and Sulzer 's Sarabande were recorded in October 1959 and came originally on the `` Misha Elman Jubilee Album '' , Vanguard Stereolab VSD-2048 -LRB- reissued on CD as SVC 125 , Mischa Elman Jubilee Album -RRB- , with various other trifles , while Tchaikovsky 's Danse Russe and Espejo 's Airs , recorded in October 1966 , came on Vanguard VSD 71173 , `` The Art of Mischa Elman '' with more encores by various others -LRB- now CD SVC-126 , Art of Mischa Elman -RRB- . So much for the facts.The various origins account for the different sonic perspectives , with almost imperceptible tape hiss in the 1962 Hebrew recital , more of it in the 1959 recordings and sonorous piano in the 1966 pieces . But the violin tone always comes out clear and bright . Except for Bloch 's Nigun - the second piece from his `` Baal Shem , Three Pictures from Chassidic Life - the pieces are by essence unsubstantial trifles and their mostly plaintive , doleful mood does n't allow for much diversity . But Elman plays them with charm and chic , beautiful tone throughout and fine support from Joseph Seiger.And then there is Nigun . Now beware
 Great remastering of classic Jewish-inspired violin recital by the master of mid-20th century schmaltz - but you get more than you expected , because there are 4 more tracks on the album that are not listed on the packaging ! Somewhere between the A&R people and the production people , a communications gap opened up . Pop the disc into your computer if you have ipod software and you will find the titles and composers of the additional tracks . -LRB- Maybe they 're not listed on the album because they are not Jewish-inspired music - two are by Tchaikovsky , after all . -RRB- But it 's all worth hearing , and even more of a bargain with 20 minutes more music !
 OMG the pieces in this collection are sublimely beautiful ! I 've only just now really gotten to know Elman 's playing , and I really love it , beyond the unsurpassed tone Elman is famous for , his poetry of expression.If you listen closely to these tracks with headphones , you can hear occasional bits of dust -- the recording used LPs as the source ! I would infer this means that sadly the original Vanguard tapes were lost ; it was a labor of love to transfer them from LP sources . They did a great job -- sonically the CD is excellent . You have to really listen for the occasional dust sounds to notice them . I wish it were a DSD transfer on SACD though , because CDs just ca n't capture the complexity of the violin 's tone.I have to say that , the recordings of one of greatest violinists of the 20th Century should receive care and attention beyond what a barely surviving record company may provide . The Library of Congress is working to preserve the legacy of wax cylinder recordings , and a broader program of cataloging and preservation ought to be developed.One very nice discovery is that the scores for 7 of the tracks can be found in the bookHebrew Melodies - For Violin & Piano .
 The pieces by Bonime , Chajes , Achron , and Lavry are gems . Joseph Achron and Julius Chajes deserve to be far better known than they are . Both composers were born in Poland but their music transcends national boundaries .
 With 31 tracks , this CD is a great buy , especially if you like the El Hazard series.Some of the things it comes with are a few stills from the Wanderers series and even includes lyrics for both the English songs AND the Japanese songs -LRB- in romaji -RRB- . The only somewhat bad thing about this album is the over-abundence of BGM -LRB- Background Music -RRB- ; they out-number the vocal songs about 5:1 . But if you like EH 's BGM , you 'll love it.Overall , this is a well put-together soundtrack , I recommend it !

 Even though I have never seen the `` Wanderers '' series , I still enjoy this CD . It is composed of mainly instrumental tracks . There are 6 tracks with vocals on it . In my opinion , that is too few . There are essentially three vocal tracks . They are all duplicated in Japanese , making the total 6 . The tracks are too short and there are not enough vocals to merit 5 stars . I 'm not saying that this CD is n't worth anyone 's time and money . I like this CD . The instrumental tracks set the mood of a room when played there . I have nothing against instrumental tracks . It 's just that a lack of varity in the vocal sector shoots one star off the board . Other than that issue , this CD is superb . Some of the tracks are mellow , some sad , some upbeat and exciting . Overall , this CD is beyond good . Although it ca n't compete with the other El-Hazard CD , that comparison is kind of like juxtaposing apples and oranges .
 I love this soundtrack !!! This is one of the only CDs in which I like all of the songs . The songs with English vocals are really good , and the original Japanese songs are even better . All of the background music have weird and wacky contemporary musical instruments , and my favorite bgm is `` Welcome to El Hazard . '' This soundtrack is so good that it can stand by itself and without the series . I never saw the Wanderers and I still love this CD . Anyone who is looking for unique contemporary instrumental music should get this CD !!!
 I listened to this soundtrack alot and thought that it was a really fun to listen to soundtrack . And if you liked the shows you 'll love this CD and even if you have n't seen the show you will still like this CD .
 Skip Heller is one of those guys who pops up on so many kinds of records that it is hard to know what he `` really '' does . This record shows that it is avant-garde lounge music . But instead of it being vapid , his lounge has real substance . Instead of it being aggressively dissonant , his avant-garde is full of fast humor . This is like cartoon music the same way Wallace & Grommit is a cartoon . The press compares him to Zappa very often , and this is right except for Heller is a lot less cynical . COUCH takes lounge and makes it something other than retro kitsch .
 this is a great new group from england , the music reminds me of pink floyd . i have watched 5 time in the two weeks i 've had it . the only problem is the picture is fuzzy on the long shots of the band , also the sound was listed on the case as dts but that was not the case o well . this is still a group to watch .
 Nazarteh , one of the only few whom is distinct , just hear the music and you know whose singing . Nazareth music is powerful but not with alot of `` noise '' . Just plain good music , in other words just let the music do the talking .
 If you buy Inside Emerson , Lake & Palmer - 1970-1995
 This product should be seen by all people that really love both music as true art and great musicians . The grade of virtuosity displayed by these three musicians here is `` Absolute Gold Standard '' . I have always loved the first album called simply `` Emerson , Lake and Palmer '' and mainly two songs one of them is `` The Barbarian '' and the other one is `` Take a pebble '' . The performance of `` The barbarian '' in this DVD is superb , very energetic , curiously this song is the first one in the first album and is the mathematical demonstration of the total virtuosity of this group as if they wanted to show since the first time that they were n't here to fool people , as if they wanted to address the following message to the world , `` we are serious musicians and we love to play musical instruments '' . The other performances here are of the same level of quality and the drum solo played by Carl Palmer here is one of the most different ones I have ever seen and listened in my life , his ability and rhythm control capacity are only equalled by Neil Peart from Rush . One thing that jumps to ones eyes is how easy they play such a complex pieces of music and how they were happy those days in playing together . Simply Buy this DVD , play it and enjoy it , you are going to watch real musician 's performances and listening to great music .
 Just to provide a little more info from a previous review . As it was mentioned this performance was broadcast on Belgium TV in 1972 and was heavily bootlegged . The original performance was in Zurich , Switzerland in December 1970 . Not sure that aspect of it has been mentioned here .
 Emerson Lake Palmer 's first album was always my favorite and this video was shot around the time of that first release . With a young Emerson Lake & Palmer in top form performing three songs from that first album , this is now my favorite DVD from ELP.It appears to be transferred from film -LRB- although the aspect ratio is still 4:3 -RRB- . The digitally re-mastered DD 5.1 sound is really very good . That is , as long as you are not comparing it to DVDs recorded with modern technology standards . But I 'd rather see an outstanding performance of a young ELP with very good sound than a recent lackluster performance with great sound.There are some `` special effects '' that are annoying -LRB- typical of concert footage from that era -RRB- , but they are not nearly as annoying as the effects in the Pictures at an Exhibition DVD.I 've included the track list and liner notes from the DVD.Track list : Barbarian -LRB- Emerson , Lake , Palmer , Bartok -RRB- Rondo / Bach ImprovisationsDrum SoloNut RockerTake A Pebble -LRB- Lake -RRB- Knife Edge -LRB- Emerson , Lake , Frasier , Janacek -RRB- Liner Notes from the DVD : The first true super group of the seventies Emerson , Lake , and Palmer were a world wide phenomenon and rose to prominence as one of the highest grossing acts in the history of rock.The band was assembled by brining together three young musical geniuses in the form of keyboard wizard Keith Emerson from the Nice along with bassist/vocalist Greg Lake from King Crimson and the legendary Carl Palmer from Atomic Rooster on drums.This was an outstanding collection of musicians and the band almost instantly shot to worldwide fame on the back of their spectacular first album.It is that first album which is featured here with ELP jamming and improvising around the core structure of the extended pieces . This is a young Emerson Lake and Palmer captured at the very beginning of a legendary career.As these pieces were filmed at the time when the band had only just recorded their ground breaking first album ELP had not yet built a large repertoire and therefore had to use all of their huge individual creative talents to create a full show . That 's what makes this film so special.Keith Emerson gives a dazzling display of extensive improvisation including all of the stage tricks , which would make ELP famous and triumphant . In this film the keyboard maestro demonstrates his full range of stunts including playing the organ upside down . Despite the showmanship the music remains rock steady as Emerson flies through a series of breathtaking improvisations based around JS Back 's `` Well Tempered Clavier '' . You 'll also find inventive percussions from Carl Palmer including a breathtaking solo spot which amply demonstrates why Palmer would go on to become the most famous rock drummer of all time.The film is capped by a bravura performance at the mike and both on bass and acoustic guitars by the young Greg Lake.Taken together these mind blowing individual performances add up to the magic of Emerson Lake and Palmer and make this an essential addition to the collection of any fan of the progressive rock era .
 I was surprised to find that this DVD is of ELP 's early performnce on Belgium T.V.that has been available as a bootleg product . In a word the DVD is OUTSTANDING . Very good resolution and sound . There 's quite a bit of improvisation and EL&P actually seem to be enjoying themselves . They do n't appear to take themselve too serious although the music is right on the mark . I have always been more of a fan of the late 70 's ELP , but this DVD has swayed me toward their early years . In any event , buy the DVD while you can . The ELP Digest indicates that the DVD was not authorized by ELP .
 This disk shows ELP very early in their career . As another reviewer has stated , there are some '' effects '' that are n't needed , but the performance is awesome . Included is an extra track at the end , and the original version of Take a Pebble with the Dog Named Blue lyrics . The band is in great spirits , and their abilities are well showcased . A must have.Let 's hope there 's more '' in the vaults '' . After seeing this disk , there can be no doubt the Emerson is the best rock keyboardist to ever take the stage . I had trouble with the sound , and could only get it to play in 2 channel Dolby . But even that way , the sound is better than most CD quality .
 During the early seventies , groups formed out of members of other rock bands that explored avenues of music that combined rock and classical elements . This was progressive rock , best represented by bands such as Yes , Genesis , Jethro Tull , Triumvirat and this trio of Englishmen who go by their last names . Keith Emerson -LRB- The Nice -RRB- , Greg Lake -LRB- King Crimson -RRB- and Carl Palmer -LRB- The Crazy World of Arthur Brown -RRB- were lean and hungry in their early years , willing to go off the deep end in their passion for music . This DVD of an old Belgian TV show is a prime example of the group 's early work . It is fresh and powerful , without the trappings that later accompanied ELP 's success . Brief interviews with the trio show that they had a sense of humor about themselves but not their music
 In response to the previous reviewer who guessed this may contain the missing songs from the `` Pictures at an exhibition '' laserdisc it is in fact not that , but their 1971 performance on Belgian Tv , the ELP management claims this is unauthorized , so best to grab it quickly . They do claim that they will be releasing a superior version as part of an upcoming ELP career retrospective , but whether that will contain the entire belgian performance -LRB- which is 2 parts each aprox 30 mins , and has circulated for years on bootleg video -RRB- is doubtfull
 as an elp fan from the get go , i bought this dvd based on reviews of the a/v quality . it definitely did not disapoint ! picture quality is better than the manticore/montreal dvd , and the footage shows a young , enthusiastic and incredibly talented ELP that was already buring white hot . word is , the band does not or did approve of this release . but with the amount of time it takes for ` anything to be released ' by them -LRB- solo or vault material -RRB- why wait ! buy it now , and enjoy ! it 's an absolute brilliant performance by a band that has long been the brunt of many undeserved negative reviews . yet stripped of all the elements that made critics hate the band , it clearly shows that the critics were wrong all along . ELP should be proud of this release .
 Rock and Roll Your Eyes was the title of the ONLY ELP concert video -LRB- way back when you went to see these concerts in the movie theater before there were VCR 's -RRB- That film consisted of what is now the DVD Pictures at An Exhibition and this group of `` missing '' songs . For years I wondered whatever happened to the rest of the film I saw in my youth . Authorized or no , I welcome it 's return .
 I was also saddened to find out this was n't an official release , but I 'm not sorry I bought it . The quality , sound and video is just wonderful and it 's a picture of ELP from a time when they were `` Masters of the Stage '' . The comedic beginning and the interviews are priceless , but the performance is just the ultimate . Keith 's improvisations , Greg 's vocals and acoustic work , Carl and Greg 's camaraderie , their youth , their passion for the music ... its all here in this video.The one tip I 'll give you when watching this dvd ... this was actually 2 shows that were spliced together to make one dvd . . so if you start from the beginning you can find many times when the boys seem to change shirts in a flash ... There 's also a spot during Knife Edge when you think Greg has repeated the same verse twice , till you notice he 's wearing a different shirt on the second verse ... its fun just spotting these little lapses in continuity ...
 This is the complete film of the February 6 , 1971 concert shot at Theater 140 in Brussels , Belgium as shown on Belgian TV 's `` Pop Shop '' program.Everything here is included in thePictures At An Exhibition -LRB- Special Edition -RRB- DVD -LRB- which has better video quality -RRB- , except for `` The Barbarian , '' which is only available on this DVD.Note that the `` Pictures ... -LRB- Special Edition -RRB- '' DVD lists separate tracks such as `` Interview '' and `` Blues Jam / Nutrocker '' but they are included in this film as well
 I LOVE NEW AGE MUSIC AND ESPECIALLY NEW AGE CHRISTMAS MUSIC . THIS IS AN EXCELLENT CD . THE MUSIC IS FRESH AND EXTREMELY WELLARRANGED . I AM GLAD I BOUGHT IT AT ADD TO MY SOME 25 NEW AGECHRISTMAS LIBRARY . I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT !
 I LOVE NEW AGE MUSIC AND THIS IS A VERY NICE CD TO HAVE FOR THOSE OF US WHO LIKE THIS MUSIC . IT IS A NICE CHANGE FROM THE TRADITIONAL MUSIC WE HEAR AT CHRISTMAS . IT IS A LITTLE MOREELECTRONIC THAN MANNHEIM STEAMROLLER , AND DAVID ARKENSTONE . SO IF YOU LIKE THEM YOU SHOULD ENJOY THIS CHRISTMAS MUSIC .
 Flares is a 2005 release by a Genoa based Port-Royal on Resonant Records . I have already voted their follow-up , Afraid To Dance , to be one of the best albums of 2007 . I bring back this earlier work in anticipation of an upcoming remix project , Flared Up , due out in the spring of ' 08 , with contributions by Manual , Dialect , Skyphone , Stafrnn H&aacute;kon , and Ulrich Schnauss to name just a few . In Flares we are graced with beautiful blend of ambient meets electronic meets shoegaze meets post-rock sound , that defies strict categorization and exists only for your earthly pleasures . One needs to put down the caffeinated drink , turn off the blinking scrollies , and pause to appreciate the album 's sheer vastness of hazed texture , lush chilled-out soundscapes , and pure tranquility . And here 's the best part , folks -LRB- I 'm quoting from the label 's site -RRB- - `` in preparation for the upcoming remix version , the royals have placed their debut album ` Flares ' for free download from their website . '' So how can you pass this by ? Recommended for followers of Hammock , M83 , Sigur R&oacute;s , and all of the above mentioned artists . Favorite tracks
 Flares is a very intricate piece of work . While I will admit it takes some patience and time to understand the album , once one understands it they are rewarded greatly . The best way to describe Flares is Explosions in the Sky mixed with a less glitchy Boards of Canada with some Hammock thrown in for good measure . Stand out songs are Jeka , Flares pt . 2 , and Karola Bloch . Karola Bloch has some of the most intense/emotional swells I have ever heard . It will send you into a new world . I highly recommend this cd to anyone who is into the ambient/post-rock genre .
 Albums like this are the reason that I listen to music . -LRB- A real , more extensive review to come at some point . -RRB-
 I am a big fan of both the regular City of God soundtrack and the first remix CD . This one is mellower in ways , which is a very nice balance . Especially great for dancing , working out or just having fun at home . This is a series of CDs where you must have all 3 CDs in your collecion but Electronica fans will want to focus on the 2 Remix projects if they must chose . So enjoy these and get the party started . Also see my review of Volume 1 .
 I was groovin ' my trobles away with this amazing soundtrack sequel to the heartbreaking film City Of God . This incredible CD agains combines infectious traditional Brazillian rhythms with top shelf Brazillian DJs to create a sonic soundscape that is as engaging and haunting at the movie itself.City Of God Remixed Volume 2 is a perfect compliment to the first soundtrack , and anyone who has heard that will enjoy this one !
 You need to hear this C.D.This is one smoking musician.I 'm not a professional reviewer , just an avid listener . I could n't agree more with the comments of the reviewers at steveheckman.com . This guy can burn like Clifford Brown , and has the beautiful lyricism of a Joe Henderson . I hear the soul of Johnny Hartman , and the high energy of a Kurt Elling in his playing.Had a chance to sample several of his other recordings , too . Heckman has gorgeous tone on all the reeds , and his styling of originals and standards on each of his recordings , whether as soloist or sideman , make for a great listening session .
 Steve Heckman 's saxophone first caught my ear as he was playing a John Coltrane tune on our local Jazz station a few years ago.I immediately liked his style of playing so I went out and bought a couple of his recordings . I was not disappointed.This one titled `` Live at Yoshi 's '' , is a good introduction to his work . This is a great straight ahead jazz recording with his own excellent quartet backing him up . It 's a nice mix of some standards and his own original compositions.I do n't know the technical terms to describe Steve 's saxophone playing but , his skills as an outstanding musician and his inspiration are plainly evident in his music . Especially on tracks such as his version of John Coltrane 's `` Equinox '' andSteve 's original swingin `` This is the Moment '' . To sum up . Just great sounding Jazz played superbly . I highly recommend it !
 Another great Tenchi CD , and I was n't surprised that it would be . I 'm glad to have both the english and japanese versions of Washu 's Lullaby and the opening theme to the Mihoshi Special . Just as good as volume 1 , if not better .
 If you like the series , chances are , you 'll like the soundtrack . Tenchi Muyo has some great music and this is one of the best soundtrack 's I 've heard .
 Prairie WindPrior to listening to this CD , I saw and listened to the DVD of Neil Young 's Ryman Auditorium shows in Nashville . those two performances introduced the tracks on Prairie Wind , the CD . I concur with most of those here who awarded this work 5 stars . IMO , there is a thread running thru those reviews as well as this man 's work which gives a glimpse of the essence of the man and his art . Prairie Wind and the Ryman DVD `` Heart of Gold '' performances are excellent . Both Mr. Young and his music demonstrate that good things really do stand the test of time .
 I 'm not calling it a perfect album , but it is a very enjoyable . Many tunes , including `` Prairie Wind '' and `` Just Like Greta '' are very strong . Oddly the only one I do n't care for is `` Keep Mediocrity at Bay '' .
 This is an incredible new album by the greatest Canadian rocker of all time . This album sounds a lot like Harvest and Harvest Moon but I can honestly say that it 's 100 times better than both of them put together . The production is amazing , I was suprised that Kanye West did n't produce these tracks , they are so slick and deep . Neil ... you are like a fine wine , you keep getting better and better with age . It would be cool if you teamed up with Snoop or 50 Cent and did a remix of The Painter , a great song . If you do n't own this CD hurry up and go buy it !!!
 Let me first say that I HATE Neil Young 's music . Neil leaving CSN&Y ; was the worst career move that I can think of . I think that his voice sounds like a naked man sitting on a block of ice in a snow storm . Wavery , Shaky , and just plain weird . I think that his hard rocking stuff and lead guitar playing are terrible . He gets the WORST sound out of his Les Paul - worse than anyone I 've ever heard -LRB- note to Neil - QUIT using the Bigsby Tremelo on your solos ! -RRB- . Having gotten that off my chest , I happened to listen to this album on Neil 's web site before I purchased it for a family member as a gift . He loves Neil ... I was totally surprised . This is a really , really GOOD album . The songs seem heartfelt and more than just ` cranky ' as Neil sometimes hits me . Acoustic , Bluesy , Countrified , and -LRB- for the most part -RRB- well-crafted lyrics make this a great , moody album . Neil reflects on life , family , politics a bit too . It 's a lot more stripped down than most of the stuff I 've heard from Neil . The absence of his electric guitar playing are worth the price of admission . I happened to read Neil 's interview in Time magazine regarding his family , mortality , and music and was very surprised that the guy I was reading about was Neil Young . He 's got a lot more depth than just being a cranky old rocker dude . My mistake . The song for his kids is really touching.This album is a good one . Buy it .
 oh man i love the negative reviewers here ... harvest moon was a comeback ? uh , yeah , after this note 's for you , freedom , and ragged glory ... and the other dude , saying how horns are wrong on a neil record . uh , guess you do n't like freedom , or after the goldrush for that matter -LRB- the oboe solo in the title song -RRB- oh , and as for the new record , prairie wind . well done , not all the songs work -LRB- for me -RRB- but the good ones are realllllly good . standouts , in order of my preference
 I heard `` It 's a Dream '' and `` He was the King '' on Saturday Night Live . Canadians have SO much to be proud of in their musicians with people like Neil Young coming from this great country
 If you are a long time Neal Young fan , Prairie Wind is a very cool breeze . Many of the cuts will bring back memories of Harvest and Harvest Moon . Not my favorite NY recording but certainly worth having in your collection .
 I totally love this CD and watched the entire DVD last night ... AWESOME !!!! Hios best record in years if not ever as far as i am concerned .
 I find it laughable that listeners would be carping that `` only '' a half dozen songs out of 10 on Neil Young 's new album are great , or that this Neil guy sure has a `` nasal '' voice.Well , the only other folks who regularly batted over 500 on their albums were the Holy Musical Trinity of Beatles-Stones-Dylan . -LRB- And as to vocals , Woody Guthrie , Bob Dylan and Van Morrison were never exactly considered to be Placido Domingo , either . -RRB- Point is that the newbies have to look beyond the American Idolitry gloss they 've been brainwashed by in recent years , and just appreciate Neil 's genius at writing songs , and his awesome skill at putting them across.As to the spoiled oldsters , no - there will never be another album the same as Harvest - so get over it .
 Neil Young has gone through all kinds of phases over the years . He 's had some misses and duds and gotten off track now and again , but when he 's good , as he is , with a couple of exceptions here , he 's really , really good.The reason he continues to be one of the most influential musicians on the planet is that there 's a consistency and intensity in spite of some of the misses.A couple of days after 9/11 , he chose to cover John Lennon 's `` Imagine '' . It could n't have been a more appropriate choice . His protest spirit continues on `` When God made me '' , which he chose to play for the Katrina benefit recently . The artists had been told specifically not to say anything political in the wake of Kanye West 's `` Bush does n't like black people '' comment.Well , for those who listened to `` When God made me '' , Neil managed to stick it to the crusading war mongers anyway.Jonathan Demme filmed Neil doing this album in its entirety at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville just after it was finished . Something to look forward to .
 I loved Neil Young 's Praire Wind album . I particularly was stricken with profound interest and awareness by the `` PainterSong '' . I am an artist , painter and poet but found levels ofmeaning beyond what I expected to encounter ... I think that thisshowed what a thoughtful wonderful man he is and how deep as afine musician and fine soul . I would like to know who hewrote this in memory to . But for me it was universal . I havewritten `` The Relicts '' project but this poem summed it up forme very well .
 THIS IS THE ONLY REVIEW I 'VE EVER WRITEN . OF MY 2000 RECORDS AND CD 'S THAT I HAVE -LRB- A DOZEN NEIL YOUNG -RRB- , THIS IS IT . LISTEN TO `` THIS OLD GUITAR '' , I MEAN LISTEN REAL CAREFULLY - IT 'S THE MOST GORGEOUS SONG I 'VE EVER HEARD . THIS IS HOT !!!
 I saw the Heart of Gold concert from the Ryman Aud . on Showtime recently and found the music and staging superb.Neil sounded great and his asides between numbers showed how sensitive a performer he really is to those in his audience . I immediately ordered the Prarie Winds CD as well as the DVD . However I was disappointed that Four Strong Winds was not included on the CD . This is a beautiful song by Ian Tyson also found on CASH - V by Johnny Cash . I would hope that Neil 's version will eventually make it to a CD in the future . I recommend both to all Neil 's fans .
 Neil gets better with age . Who would have imagined that back in the 60 's !??
 Neil Young has always been a musical chameleon . Shifting from hard rock to rockabilly to grunge to futuristic synth music , he 's tried every music genre . But the style he keeps returning to is country-rock . Prairie Wind is yet another superb album in this vein . The past few years have n't been kind to Mr. Young with the death of his father and the mother of his first child or finding out that he has a brain aneurysm . With the sense of loss and mortality , Prairie Wind reflects on life and family . `` The Painter '' brilliantly sets the tone for the album as it a brooding , moody piece that shows music gives eternal life to its artists . `` Far From Home '' is a lovely ode to his parents and `` Here For You '' is a sweet song for his kids that has a great harmonica solo . `` Falling From The Face Of The Earth '' is a gentle lament and `` He Was The King '' is a goofy salute to Elvis Presley , but one done with spirit . `` When God Made Me '' has a full gospel chorus and `` This Old Guitar '' is the best track on the album with its simple story and laid-back charm . Country-rock is the skin Mr. Young feels most comfortable in and Prairie Wind is his best album in a decade .
 Everytime Neil Young releases a mellow country rock album , it 's immediately hailed as another HARVEST . Well , this is no HARVEST nor another rather overated HARVEST MOON . COMES A TIME might be more applicable , but as far as I 'm concerned , any such comparisons are a waste of breath.This is quite simply the most satisfying Neil Young album I 've heard in years . Warm , organic & damn haunting . Death & loss are the major themes & you 'd have to be deaf not to notice it comes from the gut . All 9/11 & Chris Rock references aside , `` No Wonder '' sounds amazingly like vintage 70 's Young . His singular warble has never sounded so faltering as it does on , `` Falling Off The Face Of The Earth '' . The horns on `` Far From Home '' lend a sense of humor to what is by and large an introspective album . The goofy Elvis ode , `` He Was The King '' seems to be another one tossed in to keep things from getting too serious . For songs like `` Painter '' & the title track , the tone is certainly nostalgic but a thick coat of regret keeps things from flying away . In the hands of anyone else the sentiments of `` This Old Guitar '' would come off as a Hallmark greeting , but Young 's whispered delivery lends it undeniable gravity.I saw Young & choir sing `` God Made Me '' on the Katrina Relief concert & it stopped in my tracks . It still does here . Further proof , that if lent an unprejudiced ear , herein lies a moving & poignant album full of subtle melodies that will stick in your head if given a proper listen . Let audiophiles & die hard fans whine & gripe till they 're blue in the face.I 'm a discerning fan , not everything he 's touched turns to gold but Young 's albums are always heartfelt . Some just find themselves in your cd player more often than others . PRAIRIE WIND is destined to be one of those .
 Its been a while since a new album has caused as many immediate repeated listenings for me as Prairie Wind . I guess its inevitable to compare this recording with Neil Young 's very best songs and albums because it stands up well in that context . Many songs have touching , reflective lyrics , and maybe a philosophical maturity that is beyond anything he has written before . Several songs are standouts , and the melody that I find running through my mind later seems to vary among those . `` Its a Dream '' is so touching and absolutely beautiful ; I think anyone who has experienced significant personal loss will be moved by such an accepting interpetation of our own mortality.I 'm delighted with the accompanying dvd in this package . What a great concept , being able to see the entire album being recorded exactly as you hear it on the cd . It causes me to ponder ` what if ' scenerios of similar documentation of any of my all-time-favorite recordings . The upgrade to this duo-disk set is well worth the few dollars more .
 There are a precious few artist/musicians who can claim to have remained valid for forty years . Bob Dylan is one , Van Morrison another . Perhaps the same can be said for Paul McCartney , but of this list , it is arguable that Neil Young did the best job of remaining relevant for most of that time . His music has accompanied me throughout my life , and with `` Prairie Wind , '' it appears as though that journey is bound to continue . `` Prairie Wind '' is about reflecting on old times , and acknowledging the importance of good friends , family , and time well spent . Listening to this album is like getting a letter from an old friend who you have n't heard from in a few years . The reminiscent tone is immediately familiar and deeply touching , especially as he discusses old memories from the perspective of a person who wants to communicate thoughts that may have gone unspoken , as in `` Falling Off the Face of the Earth '' ; `` It 's such a precious thing , the time we share together . I must apologize for all the troubled times . '' Philosophically speaking , it is pretty much true that most of us do not get to really know many people - In a lifetime , we might claim a few family members and a handful of friends as truly close . Young suggests this himself in the song `` The Painter , '' when he sings `` I have my friends eternally , we left our tracks in the sound . Some of them are with me now , some of them ca n't be found . `` Over the course of his career , Neil has often confounded the public by constantly changing directions , including a few chameleonic shifts in style . However far he wanders , though , he eventually returns to his roots as a reflective country-folk artist . In that sense , `` Prairie Wind '' was inevitable , and it is welcome because it allows Neil Young to be extremely honest with himself and with his audience , at a time when honesty is a very rare commodity . `` Prairie Wind '' is the most reflective album in Neil Young 's entire catalogue , with many songs that are culled from old memories and which then evaluate how well his time has been spent . Perhaps the album 's centerpiece is a track entitled `` It 's a Dream . '' It starts with Young comforting a loved one after a bad dream , and then drifts into a dreamlike vision of a young boy fishing by a river piling . The next verse conjures an old man who watches as a train pulls away from the station and vanishes in the distance . Each time , he concludes with a chorus that states `` It 's a dream . It 's only a dream , and it 's fading now , fading away ... just a memory without anywhere to stay . '' The emotional effect of these words is deeply sad , and yet it is simultaneously comforting , telling us that in the end , we are left with our memories , and even these fade away from us , so it is good to acknowledge those who have shared their time with us.The great illusion of pop culture is how it deceives us into believing that we actually know the artist . Unless it 's abused , I do n't think that 's a bad thing . We listen closely while they share their innermost thoughts in an eloquent , artistically appealing song . We interpret their words , relate to them , and develop a sense of familiarity that in some ways transcends many ` flesh and blood ' relationships . Over the course of four decades , I have come to feel as though I genuinely know Neil Young , and `` Prairie Wind '' does nothing to dispel that notion.A - Tom Ryan
 First the Disclaimer ; I 've been a Neil Young fan since I was about 15 , and discovered CSNY . That was in 1972 . It 's generally true that Young 's albums generally fall into one of three broad `` categories '' -- his `` acoustic '' work , his `` electric '' work , and his ... `` experimental '' work -LRB- Trans , anyone ? -RRB- . I happen to LOVE both his acoustic AND his electric music ... I can usually `` pass '' on the experimental stuff.Through the years , Young 's electric music -LRB- particulary with Crazy Horse -RRB- has always been first-rate , and his acoustic material has often been either * excellent * -LRB- Harvest , After the Gold Rush , Comes a Time -RRB- , or perhaps a bit disappointing.After listening to Prairie Wind four times this week , I have now come to believe that this one ranks up there with his all-time BEST , and is certainly Young 's best work of ANY kind since 1979-80 . If you 're a Neil Young fan , do n't believe the stupid `` negative '' reviews ; this one 's GREAT . If you are n't a Neil Young fan , you 're probably not reading this ; but in case you are -- try this!BTW , the DVD looks and sounds terrific . Well worth the slightly extra cost .
 First the disclaimer
 Few artists remain relevant contributors to the world of music after so many years . Neil is not merely relevant though , as recent releases continue to match his greatest works . Prairie Wind is absolutely essential Neil . Of the so dubbed trilogy of Harvest , Harvest Moon , and Prairie Wind , Praire Wind is by far the greatest . The mood is flawlessly set , the lyrics and music complement each other splendidly and every song hits with the impact that great music always does . There 's something very unique about Young ; no one else sounds quite like him or writes quite like him . His songs just touch me in a way that those of few others can . Praire Wind features some of his most brilliant songwriting . Every single track hits the mark . I do n't just recommend Prairie Wind to diehards or even Neil fans , but to everyone and anyone that loves good music .
 Neil Young
 This is an excellent album with a lot of strong songs . I was not disappointed with any of the tracks , because they 're all `` Neil Young . `` Before I bought this album , I have been buying some of the earlier Neil Young albums , most especially `` After the Gold Rush . '' After being a fan in the 1960s and 1970s , now I hear him and say -- wow ! This is a brilliant artist that I can really identify with ! In fact , this is my favorite guy ! I saw the Jonathan Demme movie `` Heart of Gold '' about Young 's performance of Prairie Wind in Nashville , and it was great ; loved to see the band in concert ; bought the album . The tracks I personally like best are `` Far from Home '' for being a rollicking song and `` It 's a Dream '' for making me want to cry.This led me to reflect on what it is that I like so much about Neil Young . Before , I always liked him , but when `` After the Gold Rush '' exploded off the stereo into my consciousness several months ago after buying the old CD , his work has captivated me , much more so that before . Why ? I 'm 52 years old now , and I think there is such a thing as the `` lonely bull '' persona in which a guy feels on his own , in charge of his own life , which has good points -LRB- happy and fast-moving songs -RRB- and bad -LRB- makes for the sad songs -RRB- . Neil Young songs are prime examples of that . Frank Sinatra had that appeal -LRB- although he 's way before my time ; my Dad loves him -RRB- , which may account for why he was so popular . Same for Tony Bennett , whom I really like . Neil Young 's songs , in 2006 , put me in moods that I want to be in , and the core is his particular spirit , whatever that is . You want to tap into it . The emotional landscape there is attractive , whether happy or sad . The voice , the spare arrangements , but most of all the writing take you there.In terms of emotional power , to me , only John Lennon the solo artist is on a par with Neil Young . Now , I 'm the biggest Beatles fan in the world , really loved all of their stuff , and loved Lennon 's solo work . But Neil Young goes to some of the same places , and hits similar heights . For example , Lennon 's song `` Mother '' -LRB- I think that 's it 's name -RRB- also makes me want to cry and I almost ca n't listen to it . Similar effect on me , although much mellower , for `` It 's a Dream '' on Prairie Wind . To me , that is emotional power . Few artists have it.Women often seem to wonder where men 's emotions are . I say , they are found in good music .
 ... like the Tinker 's Coin from Jack Hardy 's songbook . In any case , Young has come up with a brilliant CD . And it 's simplicity is its calling card . These are songs about a marriage , about a father 's dementia , about what was sacred in a family setting , about the way Music invokes a special relationship , and the songs are delivered with an authenticity that sometimes is disarming.All of it works . And that 's remarkable for a Neil Young record . Perhaps his own brush with potential catastrophe sharpened his focus . This IS a focused CD . There is only what is necessary for the song herein . Emmylou Harris once again delivers such a perfectly complementary touch to Young 's songs that it 's a wonder they do n't work together as closely as she did with Gram Parsons . Ben Keith , Spooner Oldham lead the band through their paces . The gospel choir is understated . This is a document for the ages . Having riffed through more incendiary rockers than any of his contemporaries , Young has found via Hank Williams ' guitar an instrument to take him places . Much like Metheny with his baritone guitar on ONE QUIET NIGHT , Young here plays with something so close to ineffable grace that you wonder if the guitar is n't in some way playing him.He alludes to as much in the paean to the instrument . And that 's key to the whole album
 This tone poem on love -LRB- and love lost -RRB- , rememberance , family and time is true and resonant ... the last two songs , one on Elvis and the other on God ... interrupt the theme and the wistfulness of the previous songs ... I like these two songs , they just do n't fit here ... This cd has some really great melodies with lyrical tenderness and strength . .
 Beautiful , emotional , life defining music and lyrics for Neil at a difficult time in his life facing the brain anurism surgery , the loss of his father , and the fact that his daughter has reached young adulthood and has moved out to go to college .
 This is one of the best albums I 've heard in a long while -- a must have for Neil fans .
 Do n't be fooled . If you like Neil , it 's great ... you 'll appreciate it . There 's nothing more sincere .
 I 've only listened to this recording twice so far . I like it a lot , but I do n't think two listenings gives me the right to make stone-etched pronouncements . Go to the NPR website and listen to the 9/17/05 interview with Neil Young and you 'll get an idea what this recording is about . His father had a terminal disease ; Neil had planned to take his dad on a trip back to their family homestead in Manitoba before he passed . These songs were written with those thoughts and plans in mind . The album was recorded before they were to leave . Sadly , Neil 's dad died before they could do the trip . The album is dedicated `` For Daddy '' . It 's just a peaceful , easy-going , tribute . Neil also had some serious health issues while recording . But what a way to be remembered by one 's son . A Golden . Glorious . Memorial .
 Except for a couple of weaker tracks toward the end , this is a highly listenable album . Funny , but I played this after a recent Jason Mraz album , a solo singer-songwriter about 40 years younger than Neil . It was just okay , though Mraz gets a lot more attention than old Neil these days because Mraz is trendy . But I found the songs lacking . Then , I slipped this 05 Neil Young effort into the car cd player and , wow , what a relief . First , the incomparable vocals of Neil Young are unlike anyone else . Then , the instrumentation
 I love this album by Neil Young . Why ? It 's because it represents Neil 's signature folk sound , and is a little bolder than previous albums . In other words , this one has a little more pep , and will appeal to those who want songs that have more of a beat . On this one , you get it all
 This is a wonderful album . I find myself singing the songs in my head long after listening . His writing has matured along with us and the song topics just fit our generation . MUsic is beautiful and haunting .
 This is the work of a crazy man who has never bothered about the sale of his music , someone who has composed music and sang songs the way he wants for over 40 years now . Only such a man can make music of this quality ... music that fully absorbs him , and others . For example , Emmylous Harris covers her ears with hands each time she sings , `` This old guitar '' , probably because she wants to cut herself off totally from the outside world . Similarly , another guy -LRB- I do n't know his name -RRB- keeps his eyes shut all the while , for each of the songs . As far as I understand , some of those guys are really enjoying every moment , and are as much absorbed by the whole thing as Neil Young is . Songs such as `` Painter '' and `` This old guitar '' that will linger and continue to reverberate long after one is done listening to the CD.It 's a sad fact is there is no higher rating than 5 stars in Amazon , because that does not do justice to it .
 This is a FINE album ! Several songs are fantastic from the first listen , and a few others warm with repeated listens . Buy this album for songs like ` The Painter ' , ` This Old Guitar ' , and the beautiful ` Falling Off the Face of the Earth ' . ` When God Made Me ' is another great song that you will warm to with a few listenings .
 One of the things I love about Neil Young is that he so effortlessly divides people , even his fans -LRB- as the reviews of this album perfectly demonstrate -RRB- . Me , I think this cd is fantastic . If you came to Neil via grungy old Ragged Glory , Mirror Ball , Sleeps with Angels or are a happily unreconstructed old rocker who only loves Neil for Rust Never Sleeps/Weld/Everybody Knows this is Nowhere , then maybe this one wo n't tickle your fancy as much . But if you got into him via Harvest/Harvest Moon/Silver and Gold/Comes a Time/After the Goldrush or saw the Greendale tour and thought it was a lot better than the studio versions of the songs , then I think you 'll think this is a cracker too . It 's got this wonderful combination of thoughtful reflection on songs like The Painter and Only a Dream , and a sort of mad joyous , want-to-jump-up-and-shout-for-joy vibe on songs like He Was The King and No Wonder . I 've lived with this album for a month now and every time I listen it leaves me feeling happier than when I started out . I think this is his best album for a good 10 years or more . And it 's so typical of Neil Young that more than a few people disagree very strongly .
 Neil young comes threw with another classic album.after a great greendale cd , neil gives us more gold.no wonder , prairie wind , and it 's a dream are my favorit songs.the people leaving these stupid bad review 's are musically challenged.Neil 's the best !
 wanted more wanted more sooooooooooooo great sooo great greatful soooooo soooooo good so good greatful greatful greatful soooo nice nice
 Loved the classic Neil Young with great lyrics . Quality was excellent . I would recommend even if you ar n't a Neil Young fan .
 Neil Young gets better with age . This is truly poetry in motion and I listen to it over and over again .
 Love this cd , trying to rebuild my collection . And this is a must have.Arrived in great shape and on time .
 Of course it 's Neil Young after all . Great music to just sit back and enjoy . I would recommend &#34; Prairie Wind &#34; to friends & family .
 The breezy , mellow feel to the opening song on this CD , `` The Painter , '' perfectly sets the pace and tone of `` Prairie Wind . '' `` The Painter '' quietly offers up laid-back but nostalgic lyrics sung in a wary , classic Neil Young voice ; a beautiful slide guitar intersperses the gentle guitar plucking ; light drums and a dependable bass lend weight to the composition . Undoubtedly , `` Prairie Wind '' was an ideal title for this album . The following tune , `` No Wonder , '' contains a darker sound , but the song 's lyrics uphold the naturistic feel of the CD , and convey a sense of one 's own mortality.The down-home instrumentation and vocals make it seem as if these tunes could be played on the rustic porch of a windswept prairie in the middle of nowhere . `` Falling Off the Face of the Earth '' is an example of Young 's amazing ability to mesmerize simplistically , without bells and whistles . Whether he 's rocking out electrically with his Crazy Horse band or playing lighter fare , as on `` Falling , '' many of Young 's songs have a way of sneakily sucking you in in a catchy , repetitive manner that 's lulling , both vocally and musically . On some of Young 's tunes , seven minutes have passed by before you realize it ; but somehow , the composition does n't drag.Not all of `` Prairie Wind '' is soothing Western ballads played on the Badlands . `` Far From Home '' has a good-time , old-fashioned vibe that 's endearing like an enjoyable family reunion ; the title track dares to flex its acoustic muscle with hardened but longing lyrics and great backing vocals by a slew of talented female musicians ; `` He Was the King , '' a tune about Elvis in all his incarnations , is pure rock and roll fun , while `` When God Made Me '' is a piano-soaked gospel relic that questions just as much as it faithfully believes.As poignant as all these songs are , perhaps none are more so than the sublime `` This Old Guitar , '' sung and played plaintively by Young , but somehow stirring up emotion by the truckload . The song is indicative of this entire heartwarming album , which thrives on simplicity , feeling and easy hooks .
 I too recently saw Neil Young and his friends perform on Shotime at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville . I am a seasoned Neil Young fan and I am excited to order his Prairie Wind concert DVD for my 30-year-old son , who has music ambitions of his own . Neil Young has so much to teach this generation and I am comfortable with the way he models for our young music aspirants .
 Prairie Wind is simply awesome . It is shot for High Definition , wide Screen and if you have those with surround sound you will feel like you are at the concert . The footage is remarkable and Neil sounds as good as always -- maybe better . He plays new music from the Prairie Wind CD and then ends with many of his greatest hits . I watch it about once a week and everyone who I have had with me to view it have been floored by how good this is . If you like Neil Young at all then this is a must for your collection . Do n't rent this . Own It .
 I bought Neil Young 's 33 1/3 album , ` After the Gold Rush , ' in April 1972 . Until April 2006 , I had had no further contact with his music . At that time , I just by chance chose to see the documentary , ` Heart of Gold , ' at a movie theater in Knoxville . It was a captivating experience . I felt I had been lifted into the presence of honest , powerful art and pure poetry . I buy few DVD 's and own few ; this was one I had to have . Now I am in danger of over-playing it and wearing the edge off my enthusiasm .
 I realy like this cd . Smooth and calm music . Just like in the 70 's . Finally , so glad he 's come back . Wonderfull ! Thanks Neil & Band .
 This is a light , dark , introspective tour through the mind of Neil contemplating his mortality . It 's an image-filled attic that takes you for a great ride . Lots of good cuts , some pure inspiration , and minimal filler material . If you love the way Neil 's mind works , Prairie Wind provides more of the picture . Some great sounds , too !
 The GoodThe great thing about a Neil Young record is that you never know what you 're going to get . He 's done everything from hard rock to rockabilly . Prairie Wind is a mellow , country flavored release . Acoustic finger-picking and layered vocal melodies will draw you into the opening track `` The Painter '' . `` Falling Off the Face of the Earth '' slows the pace down to a crawl . Young 's patented falsetto rings out from time to time throughout the verses . `` Far From Home '' employs a brass section and harmonica to accent its bluesy sound . Young lays down some great guitar slides and bends . `` It 's a Dream '' is a sad ballad whose tone is enhanced by a soft string arrangement and piano playing . `` Prairie Wind '' trots along like a cowboy on his mighty stead . `` He Was the King '' is a clever tribute to Elvis Presley . Either Young did his research or he knew the man personally . It 's set to a catchy rhythm and has a gospel meets rock warmth to it . The final track `` When God Made Me '' is the centerpiece of the entire album . If this one does n't get you thinking or crying , then you must be dead . Young emits such emotion and intelligence with this one.The BadNothing notable.The VerdictI would have liked to have heard a rocker or two , but overall the album is of high Neil Young quality . I 've never really thought that Neil Young was a great singer , but he always delivers well-written and thought-provoking lyrics . Prairie Wind will trigger lots of emotions within you ; as I 'm sure it did for Neil .
 I just love this new cd of Neil . True fans should have this album in there Neil Young collection . The music here touches the soul . I pattern this cd with Harvest Moon . Neil my man , please continue to make great music .
 Neil Young 's place in the pantheon of , whatever you want to call it ... let 's just say `` all music '' is assured . He is one of the greatest musical artists ever , end of story . Whether or not this album is a critical and/or commercial hit is immaterial
 This C.D. is one of the best that I have heard by anyone in the last 10 years . If you liked Harvest , you will love this one . The mood is slow and and so introspective . I really wish that he would make more like this . I would buy them in a hurry !!!! ENJOY !!!!!!!
 Neil Young waltzes on the brink of sentimental but never falls over the edge . He does the same with politics . Only when you listen carefully do you hear he 's said something radical . Never does the music stop being good .
 Thee are three kinds of Neil Young albums
 Neil Young 's career has been punctuated by a stubborn earnestness which , while occasionally soliciting the disparagement of critics , has resulted in some of the most heartwarming and awe-inspiring music of the 20th century . `` Prairie Wind '' finds Young in familiar territory ... gentle guitar arrangements accompanied by subtle yet effective instrumentals . Lyrically , `` Prarie Wind '' is certainly indicative of a man who has recently confronted his own mortality -LRB- Young recently recovered from a brain aneurysm -RRB- and is quite content with bittersweet ruminations on the past , present , and future . `` The Painter '' sets the tone for what is to follow
 I am listening to the CD right now , again . This CD is truly amazing . It captures the best Neil Young has to offer . Very moving . The first track , Painter , is an especially beautiful song , as are many other tracks . It 's a Dream is `` off the charts '' amazing . Melodic , soulful and sweet . Once of his best balads ever . Ca n't stop listening to this one . When God Made Me is truly a spiritual experience . BUY this album , you WILL NOT be disappointed . In fact , buy one for your mother , friends , and kids . Excellent production quality . Top notch musicians . IT IS REALLY REALLY GOOD .
 The first time I listened to the album , I enjoyed the basic sound . By the fourth time , after reading the lyrics , the album is one of his best . And that 's saying something when you consider the Harvest albums , the Buffalo Springfied albums , CSNY , and Crazy Horse.I have not read much at all about the song , It 's a Dream , but it 's a standout , where Young creates wonderful images then calls the image a dream and says , `` It 's a dream , it 's only a dream , and it 's fading now ... '' illustrating the surreal nature of life and life passing . I cried the fourth time I listened -LRB- first time really listening -RRB- to Hear for You , essentially , a letter from a deceased parent for a child with the message , in other words , `` I let you go when the time came , but now you must let go of me so that you may move forward with your life . But if you need me , look for my spirit . '' This album definately carries Young 's spirit but may be a bit too serious or reflective for an audience below , let 's say , 21 .
 What can one say about Neil Young ? He has gone down the highway in the slow lane , the passing lane and sometimes in the ditch but he always writes what he FEELS . That is what makes him so GREAT . The new album is very touching . I laugh , He was the King , I cry , When God made me , I reflect , This old guitar . There is not a bad song in the lot . Of course there are those that think differently but Neil does what he does and THAT is what makes him who he is . Sure , he 's run the gamut of weirdness
 Perhaps , like me , you are concerned of the hype surrounding Neil Young 's newest release . Oh , no-not another heralded cd from a back-side of fifty voice from the past ! I fell for the hype surrounding the newest albums by Bruce Springsteen , Paul McCartney , Van Morrison , and the Rolling Stones . Those albums have not been bad , but they have -LRB- IMHO -RRB- fallen far short of the hype lavished on them.Neil Young 's newest release is worthy of the hype it has received . While not quite the career-resurrecting achievement of Dylan 's TIME OUT OF MIND or LOVE AND THEFT , Prairie Wind finds Neil in fine form making memorable music once again .
 Well I ca n't give this album 6 stars , but I would like to . Are there any musicians who have lasted as long as Neil Young and still produced good music ? I do n't think so . I 've listened to so many other claims as to what might be the `` Best Album of 2005 '' or `` Best Album of the Year '' , but they all fall short compared to this album . Neil Young is heartwarming and yet melancholy , passionate yet detached in this album . It is easily the best album of the year , and possibly one of the best albums I 've ever listened to . For someone like me , who has become so disenchanted with modern `` rock '' in any form , country rock , hard rock , whatever the hell , it really takes an amazing album to make me return to any music that has guitar . Leave it to Neil Young to bring me back to reality . For a work of true genius and pure emotion by one of the greatest musicians of all time , go get this CD and enjoy it as much as I have . I could go on and on , but for those who have short attention spans , I will end this review here .
 I 've been a fan of Neil 's since I first heard Mr. Soul with Buffalo Springfeild and after hearing/seeing this combo CD/DVD , I know why I keep coming back ! Whether he 's electric or acoustic , he 's a wordsmith of the 1st order.This is Neil via acoustic with musicians who 've been on ` Harvest ' , ` Comes a Time ' , ` Harvest Moon ' and more . The central connection between most of the songs has to do with his roots growing up in Canada and you get a sense of memories that were the building blocks of who he is as an adult . The folk singer musician once again stands out here with wonderful arrangements for pedal steel , piano , dobro , sax , drums , backing vocals and tamborine.This is a MUST for any Neil Young collection and I 've about got 'em all !
 I have been a Neil Young fan since the early 70 's . This is a great CD , every song is wonderful . If you are a Neil Young fan , you have to listen to this one . Classic Neil all the way . Thanks Neil for some more great music !!
 This album has created a lot of confusion . Many have confused the Neil Young of this album -LRB- hereafter N.Y. -RRB- with the Neil Young of such albums as `` Harvest , '' `` Tonight 's the Night , '' and `` Sleeps with Angels . '' That Neil Young has n't made an album since 1997 -LRB- Broken Arrow -RRB- . This is a mistake that even Rolling Stone and Amazon.com has made , so do n't feel too bad about it.This is a different N.Y. , whose catalogue includes Silver and Gold -LRB- 1999 -RRB- , Are You Passionate -LRB- 2002 -RRB- , Greendale -LRB- 2003 -RRB- , and now , the enigmatic Prairie Wind.Prairie Wind succeeds where his previous 3 albums have failed . It is a myriad of styles and lyrical tone which N.Y. has perfected over the previous 3 albums . This is not to say that this is simply a new coat of paint ; rather it is N.Y. creating a new vehicle from old parts . He 's stripped off all that bogged the other albums down , and thrown together an entirely new machine.So rather than comparing this to the efforts of the similarly named Neil Young , take N.Y. 's new car for a ride ...
 I appreciate Neil Young and his new album even though I do n't have it yet . I ordered it from Amazon.com but it has n't shipped yet but that 's ok . I just keep listening to it on Neil Young 's web site . I hope we have many more wonderful albums from Neil like this one . When I heard When God Made Me this summer on Live 8 it sent chills down my spine . What an inspired song . Also seeing and hearing Neil play Walking To New Orleans from CMT made me cry . Thanks so much Neil for putting your feelings into music for us .
 From the beginning of the first set you plunge into the Neil Young universe . I will not grade the sets . There are some that I associated within my life experiences and some not so much . His politics are aired / or are they masked . If you have ever liked Neil Young - BUY THIS ONE .
 Oni koji Neil Young nisu voleli do sada , nece ga zavoleti ni sa ovim albumom . Oni koji su ga voleli , nastavice . Ovo je jednostavno Neil klasika . Apsolutno magicno . Dokaz da stara skola jos uvek moze mnogo toga da da .
 Once again the master puts out another great CD . After all these years Neil keeps creating excellent music . I ca n't remember the last time I played a new cd 5 times straight from beginning to end . When God Made Me , Prairie Wind , It 's A Dream , The PainterClassic ! ----------------------------------------------------------------- Was he planning only for believersOr for those who just have faith?Did he envision all the warsThat were fought in his name?Did he say there was only one wayTo be close to him?When God made meWhen God made me ----------------------------------------------------------------- Mark.Ontario , Canada
 This is his softer stuff ... and so so so beautiful.Who has the right to put Neil Young down anyway ? It 's Neil Young ! I think he has earned the right to do whatever he wants ... and this album is downright lovely !
 The thing is , people always like to compare one set of work against another . In the case of Neil Young 's body of work , you ca n't compare anything to Neil , not even old Neil . There is a continuity , but its also like reviewing a new artist -- cause you do n't know what Neil you will get , or if it will be a brand new version . Prairie Wind offers a familiar yet still fresh Neil . It has songs I think will be classics , at least three . I use two tried and true measures of how good any new Neil is
 Comfortable . That 's how I 'd describe the new Neil Album . It 's familiar and down home-y . At the same time there 's also an odd quality of The Dating Game horns meets Nashville . Strange as that sounds Neil somehow makes it work , and makes it seem as natural as wood . It takes me back and forth to the past and yet it still manages something new and different . That 's what I love about Neil .
 Neil Young has been one of my biggest influences , and he always amazes me with his brilliant albums . He bedazzled me with Greendale , his last album , and I was looking very forward to owning prairie wind , but as it turns out , pw is not as good as I expected . Do n't get me wrong , it 's a good album , but not great . I definitely like it though .
 I have always favored Neil Young 's acoustic endeavors over his louder electric and often distorted Crazy Horse releases . `` Prarie Wind '' , ranks right up there with `` Harvest , Harvest Moon , and Comes A Time '' . Not only is this release listenable , but Young comes across as a master story-teller in a way that is very Dylan like . The melodies are ear catching , and the instrumentation is crystal clear . It makes you feel as though you are sitting on a porch sitting next to Neil for a an evening sing a long . This is a fantastic effort on Neil Young 's part , that is without question one of his best releases to date . Do n't miss out on this one .
 I have always admired and liked Neil Young as far back as I can remember , and for several reasons ; he sang Canadian , he sang with a heart and he cared about what he was singing . Like Dylan , his voice was not polished , but poetic , was not fine-tuned but well-worn . Now decades later , listening to Prairie Wind , nothing has changed . From the lyrical , light and lovely `` Painter '' to the reverent and thoughtful `` When God Made Me '' , Neil Young is the ultimate musical storyteller . There is an air of humility that brands this album , perhaps from his recent bout with a brain aneurysm or simply a thankfulness for having 50 plus years and making music . Prairie Wind is an enlightenment of Neil Young 's life journey and I could n't help get the feeling he invited me along for the walk .
 At least since Silver and Gold , Mr. Young 's music seems to have transformed . Its basic ingredients remain
 now too the album this is the final in the trilogy , that beckon 's young 's creative folk rock beauty , starting with harvest harvest moon and now prairie winda beauty book end to the chapter 's that un-ravel depth and beauty as every song fades into a minasual murmur.this album was a highlight in the year when not much was happening from the old rock and roll pensioner home , , paul mccartney released another dismal album . . but neil young keeps un-ravelling beauty , after all these yearsgod bless the old coot , he 's not wanking his strings this time like failed eighties experimental albums i.e transhe leaves me mesmerised by the stripped bare to the bones nature of each of these blissful `` paintings '' of songs . . a classic album by the `` godfather of grunge ''
 I have n't bought this CD yet -- but will as soon as I finish writing this review . Having just seen the movie , I can only say that this is one of those magically - divinely ? - inspired musical moments . At 56 , I 'm slightly younger than Young and his friends and musicians who put on this concert in Nashville . Neil 's song to his 21 year old daughter -LRB- mine is 22 -RRB- made me weep and smile at the same time . His tributes to Hank and his own ` daddy ' were , well , ` golden hearted . ' Neil , at this point in our lives , the ` road behind us ' is longer than the one ahead -- but I hope for my sake , that the road ahead for you is as long as possible . P. S . The kid behind the ticket counter asked me my age . I said `` 61 . '' He offered -- and I accepted -- the ` senior discount . '
 A Neil young album is like a leather jacket . It takes some getting used to , it might seem a little too shiny at first , you have to break it in , and once you do , you begin to realize that you never want to let it go . That 's how I feel about Prairie Wind ... . At first , I was a little put off , those horns seemed a tad corny , the choir singers a little out of place . But after several -LRB- okay , maybe twenty -RRB- run throughs , I began to see the utter magic of this album . . Simplistic complexity ... `` No Wonder '' stands out like another `` Dangerbird '' - the chord changes and hooks invite you , indeed pull you , into Neil 's wonderful world of juxtapositions . I love the line , `` Somewhere a senator sits in his leather chair , behind his wooden desk . The caribou he killed mean nothing to him , he took his money just like all the rest ... '' Classic Neil . The album radiates Neil 's wonder with the world , the haunting , Jack Nitzsche-esque `` It 's a dream '' paints some incredible and touching pictures . You get the feeling that Neil thought that THIS was very possibly his last album -LRB- not counting his archives -RRB- . Thank god , we have him for sometime to come -- he is a treasure . Oh , and by all means watch the DVD , not only is the sound quality better -- you get to see what everyone put into this effort ...
 As usual Neil Young is right on the money . Neil has stayed on top of things for 5 decades because he is a constantly changing flow of creatism . This album is no different . Sometimes I think Neil has a seperate personality to go with each of his styles of music . On this album Neil performs much the way you would expect a `` just turned '' 60 year old man , facing life threatening ailments , and who just lost his father would . Neil reflects on life , and his memories . He does a heck of a job at it too . To me the entire album is a highlight , but if I had to think of a song that stands out I would have to say it is `` No Wonder '' . But if I had to choose a quote or a ling from a song I would have to say that the chorus from `` Far From Home '' takes it all . `` Bury me out on the PrairieWhere the Buffalo used to roamYou wo n't have to shed a tear for meCause then I wo n't be far from home `` Then you have the DVD , the DVD is great . As a recording musician myself , I love to see what Neil does in the studio to actually complete a recording like this . Buying this Prairie Wind , and then opening it up and seeing the DVD is like buying a BMW and opening the glovebox and finding a check for $ 100,000 . The DVD is the real jewel of the two !!
 Neil Young , Prairie WindNeil Young shares what he values in Prairie Wind , taking us on a poetic tour of his southern homelands , from songs reflecting on life 's dreams like `` The Painter '' to fond memories of Elvis in `` He Was The King . '' Aptly named , the album starts and ends with the sounds of the prairie winds , and Young 's Nashville musical roots are emphasized throughout the album by the use of traditional instruments like the pedal steel , fiddle , harmonica , and Hammond B3 Organ .
 I 've been a fan of Neils for 25 years now , and the Neil Young that I know , and have grown up with , is in this album - alive and well . From the moment I saw ` The Painter ' video and listened to some tracks on his website , I could n't wait to get my copy . This CD will get plenty of playtime on my CD player and my MP3 player . I cant get enough of tracks like The Painter , He was the King , It 's a Dream , Here for You , and Falling Off The Face of the Earth . But if you want to hear that oh-so familiar sound that is unmistakably Neil Young , than you can find it in ` This Old Guitar ' . A ` must ' for any Neil Young fan .
 What a gift this album is . Neil reveals so much about who he is in this beautiful look back at childhood , Canada , his father , his family and the mysticism of music . Do writers really `` make it up '' or does it already exist , just waiting to manifest through them ? Neil often says he does not know where the music comes from , but is thankful for it and does all he can to remain open to it . I find the album to be deeply moving and powerful , especially The Painter , Falling Off The Face Of The Earth , Prairie Wind and my favorite , This Old Guitar with its simple melody , humble and reverent lyrics , Ben Keith 's slide guitar and Emmylou Harris vocal , it is just so good . I just realized that next year will be 40 years that Neil has been important in my life . Thank you so much .
 I 've loved Neil Young ever since I graduated from college . The man has an honesty about him that is extremely rare . His voice , though broken and scrappy , lets the listener feel the layers of the song.Prairie Wind is about a lot of things , but personally I think it is about respect . Not the gaining of respect , but more along the lines of appreciating what has happened to a man throughout his lifetime . By now I 'm sure everyone knows what he 's gone through , and in an interview , Neil wished no one knew about his brain surgery . By knowing , the listener is already biased to the music before going in . Neil is a very ` open ' singer , thus it takes a very ` open ' listener to appreciate his music ... patient as well.All this being said , Prairie Wind is a very nice album , as smooth as a James Taylor album but beyond the smoothness lies many questions about existence , God , love , and holding on.I 'm a writer , and this music does an incredible job of setting the mood and allows me the chance to clarify a lot of things in my head . Perhaps that is why Neil makes these ` windy ' albums . After the large Greendale project , something simple should have beeen expected . He is a loud and soft kind of guy . Though many people compare this album to Harvest and Harvest Moon -LRB- the latter in ` This Old Guitar ' sounds a lot like the title track ... a lot ! -RRB- I look at it more from ` Comes A Time ' , probably one of the best sing-a-long albums out there . Harvest went in different directions , and Harvest Moon seemed determine to stay as close to mellow as possible . Prairie Wind is , without a doubt , the most humble album he has ever made . Like some critics have said , it lacks the creative thrust that many Neil Young albums are known for -LRB- Rust Never Sleeps , On The Beach -RRB- , but it still remains one of the most honest CD 's out there . Listen to it at nighttime with something nice to drink as you watch the sunset . If you do n't like it after that , then you never will.Favorite Song
 I have read through the other posts for Prairie Wind , and everyone 's comparisons of Priaire Wind to this Neil album or that Neil album - always a waste of time with any artist that grows older and changes with the time . I do understand some of the frustration of some of the listeners - you ca n't always follow even your favorite artists through all of their phases . Heck , I lost Springsteen in the 80 's , and have only enjoyed his two acoustic albums since -LRB- I do n't even want to talk about Devils and Dust -RRB- . But we are discussing Neil 's new album ... I found it comforting , emotionally moving in its personal touches -LRB- especially his thoughts on his dad -RRB- , and Falling Off the Face ... is simply a beautiful love song from the perspective of a man who struggles to make his emotions known . The only thing that bugged me a bit was using the orchestration a little heavy handed on too many of the tracks . I prefer the raw sound . I honestly can not reccommend a better fall album than Prairie Wind , and I look forward to grabbing my lawn seat this summer to watch Ol' Neil givin ' it to us live . For those who missed the Greendale concerts , I am sorry to tell you that you missed one of the greatest performances of any musician in the thirty years that I have been attending concerts .
 Thank God , Neil does n't . Just another great album from old shakey.No wonder and prairie wind are instant classic 's . other gems are ` the painter ' , falling of the face of the earth '' far from home ' & ` here for you ' . This album does n't have a clunker.It 's in the same vain as harvest and silver and gold , but it has it 's own fill to it.In response to the critic 's who tell you this cd suck 's , and too buy this , that , & this instead.I say buy this , that and prairie wind.It 's neil , and it 's all good!you critic 's got mash potatoe 's , but you got no t-bone . Long my you run neil !
 Neil tackles alot of subject matter here , ecology , family -LRB- the loss of his father -RRB- 9/11 , the decline of our civilazation , a tribute to Elvis , a tribute to Hank Williams SR. in This Old Guitar which Neil somehow obtained , God in When God Made Me . the songs are more like After The Goldrush , Harvest Moon , Harvest and Old Ways . Neil recorded all of this shortly after discovering he had an anyeurism and prior to his surgery . So there is also a sense of immortality that weaves it self through the cd . There is not one single bad song.I listened to the whole cd on his web site for weeks before it was released and bought it instantly when it came out.If you liked Comes A Time , Silver & Gold or any of the previous cds mention , you will love this one It simply beats them all .
 A brilliant evocation of the universal longing for home . Impeccably produced . Young sends his love with PRAIRIE WIND .
 This is acoustic like I have n't heard Neil , or anyone , do before . Neil dug deep for this one -- the lyrics are lyrical , the singing heartfelt -LRB- even where it 's Shakey -RRB- and he gets real weight out of his acoustic guitar with some of the finest rythmn playing I 've ever heard , from anyone . It reminds me of Jimi 's rythmn playing on `` All Along the Watchtower '' . Say what you will , for me this cuts everything he 's done acoustically , overall , except Harvest and in some ways -LRB- maturity and heart -RRB- it 's beyond them all . Even the horns work , which surprises me as much as anyone , and the strings are great !!! Everything fits tightly into the whole to create a truely powerful experience . I 'm VERY surprised , but Neil Young has pulled it off . Taken together , this is the best Neil Young record since -- `` Rust Never Sleeps '' ? , `` Sleeps with Angels '' ? ----- in the end though , in the unique way Neil has of crafting individual and unique works , it has no peers .
 I 've been a Neil Young fan for over 10 years . He 's been an important part of my life . I was first awstruck by the song `` After the Gold Rush . '' I wondered , when I first heard it , whose chilling falsetto voice is that with such amazing lyrics ? I was driving when I heard the song and was just blown away . . I can only compare his voice to that of the singer of Five for Fighting . I find it beautiful and unique . Like Neil , himself.Prairie Wind starts with a mellow and catchy tune and then enters into a scene from Hawks and Doves with No Wonder . Very similar start off to `` Captain Kennedy . `` Tracks 3 , 4 and 5 really hit the road running . `` Falling off the Face of the Earth '' is a very pretty song . I especially love Neil 's voice on this one and how he manages to even take it an octave higher . Very effective and melodic.What really stirred me up was the next song , `` Far from Home . '' It 's a blues/folksy song with horns intermixed -LRB- like from his album `` This Notes for You . '' You 'll find yourself slapping your knee or stomping your foot on this one . The song itself is a reflection on family values , memories of growing up , his father and his longing for the stark tranquility of the prairie , which I can strongly relate to . . Next , is my favorite song , `` It 's a Dream . '' This is a masterpiece through and through . The way Neil conjours up images of the past and explains them is amazing . The song brings visions of a simpler and better time . A boy fishing under a bridge , the blueness of the sky , the winds of autumn , an old man taking time to talk to a policeman when policeman had time to chat , the imagery of a train station and its passengers departing into the prairie . For Neil , these were days passed by that he is longing for again . A more innocent time . This song brought tears to my eyes for so many reasons . Almost like `` A Man Needs a Maid '' does for me when I hear the lyrics '' . . when will I see you again ? . . `` Here there is a more classical music sound mixed with the tune.Of course , you 'll never hear it on mainstream radio due to being too lengthly and actually having substance . Truly a great song that makes you think of your own good memories . Neil really gets in your head with this song.It truly , to me , is one of Neil Young 's most amazing songs ever made . `` Prairie Wind '' , `` Here For You '' and `` This Old Guitar '' all are very good songs , as well . `` This Old Guitar '' seems to come from Harvest Moon and is very nice . `` Prairie Wind '' is catchy with repeated chorus verses by backup singers -LRB- I think Pegi , his wife , and Emmylou Harris -RRB- `` He Was The King '' is a tribute to Elvis and `` When God Made Me '' is almost a gospel song . I could easily see churches using these lyrics for their choirs to sing . It 's a nice song asking questions of belief , existence and why we 're all here . I heard Neil play this live and liked it.All in all , this album fuses sounds from Harvest , Harvest Moon , On The Beach , This Notes for You , Silver and Gold and Greendale in a very smart way . Neil is always changing and inventing himself . This is why I love his music and presence so much.I ca n't wait to see what 's next.Great effort by the master !
 Neil Young has created four decades of music . His first solo record came out in 1969 . Now it 's 35 years later and we got Prairie Wind . His last few albums have been weird and strange . Young has gone back to the basic for this one . He recorded it in Nashville . It is mostly an acoustic record . The first songs `` The Painter '' and `` No Wonder '' are excellent . He has created maybe some of his best songs since Harvest -LRB- 1972 -RRB- . Emmylou Harris sings on a few of these songs . The production is really great . There are a lot of horns and strings on this record . There are a lot of musicians too . I do n't want to say that it is just voice and guitar because there is a full band sound on most of the tracks . But this is a more intimate Neil Young record , than a typical Crazy Horse rock record . The song `` Prairie Wind '' has some cool guitar picking on it . Young has n't lost the fire , like some young bands have recently . The melody of `` Here For You '' is just lovely . People have told me that the last few Dylan records have been good . I am not so sure if that is true . But some of these songs show that Neil Young is still very gifted in this late period . He has the ear for the music . `` He Was The King '' has that raw feeling that is just wonderful . Neil Young may be the greatest gifted songwriter that I know of . This guy is the real deal .
 This is some of Neil Young 's finest work . It is truly an inspired offering . I have found it to be outstanding from the first to the last and I rarely listen to it in any fashion other than in its entirety.This has gradually grown to become one of my favorite albums of the last 10 years . Whenever I put it down I find myself coming back to it and always thinking that it is better than I remember it . The album has a remarkable continuity or `` album arc '' that weaves its way through each track . These songs are good individually , but outstanding as a package deal . There are many common themes expressed in many different ways . You get a glimpse into Neil 's mind during a tough period for him -LRB- and the associated ups and downs that go with it -RRB- . These emotions and memories are extremely relateable and the way they are expressed feels immediately familiar.Thanks Neil ! I 'll keep enjoying this album for decades to come .
 Well-produced , great lyrics , very nostalgic , introspective , soft country feel , big collaborative effort . Play it several times - let it get inside of you . I purchased this CD , because I fell in love with Jonathan Demme 's documentary film `` Neil Young - Heart of Gold '' . Between my boyfriend and me , we now own 3 copies of the CD and it 's on all of our electronic devices . I 'm a long time Neil fan and I love his louder , harder , rockier music , too , but this album is something different and very special . Highly recommend !
 A new MASTERPIECE is born
 `` Prairie Wind '' is a collection of beautiful songs . `` The Painter '' , in no uncertain terms , sets a wonderful tone to start the album ... thoughts in shades of color to match the moods of a lifetime . There 's really `` No Wonder '' how such an artist can distinguish the good imagery in one memorable song after another.Into track 3 , I really start to feel the affecting power of the music ... you can feel Neil 's heartfelt appreciation here . `` Far From Home '' he 's not , as we 're able to share his sense of good times with family in the land he loves , and it nearly becomes a little piece of the listener 's home as well when you 're awash in such imagery . `` It 's a Dream '' now , but oh my goodness , the beautiful music and scenes to experience ... I 've never heard a song that sounds and feels at once so real yet imaginary . He and band take us to places that could seem familiar , but where we 've never quite been through musical art like this.When you listen to `` Prairie Wind '' you 're in a way allowing yourself to be painted into the picture that Neil creates with lyrics , while the music lifts and soothes your spirit in tune . With the songs we 're allowed to come along with Neil into his lyrical landscapes , and we 're able to share in the wondrous mindscape that is `` Prairie Wind '' . ` Mindscape ' is n't a word actually , but shows how the album can affect you personally ... the breathtaking imagery arouses memories of my own lifetime that are reflected in how I feel through the songs ... portraying the concerns for family happiness , fun and the deep questions that we all feel -LRB- `` When God Made Me '' -RRB- . Neil Young and the wonderful band , through their art , have given us the chance once again to enjoy a portrait of one of the greatest musical minds of our lifetime . Buy `` Prairie Wind '' and chances are you too will treasure the experience .
 I must admit I 've mostly just listened to this CD while in the car and have n't analyzed the lyrics . The overall impression is of mellow , relaxing music with Neil 's pleasant-sounding voice -- that is , he 's not sounding raunchy , nor screaming , etc. , on this CD . Read other reviews for analysis of the lyrics , but if you want a good CD to mellow out with , this is a good pick .
 Once again Neil Young has wriiten a beautiful story through his music . An added bonus is watching him on the DVD . Got ta love the harmonica , and the musical arrangement overall takes my breath away . This Old Guitar is so pretty ... kinda reminds me of ` Without Rings '' from Silver and Gold ... I am looking froward to Mr. Demme 's interpretation .
 Mr. Young does a nice job this time with the 10 selections . Neil & his group goes back to basics with excellent country rockers in this light collection . Neil is doing what he does best , commentaries along with great melodies & a pleasant sound . Mr. Young is a living legend , listen to this CD by candlelight outside , you will get the message . Neil Young , live forever - ROCK ON !
 When i read that the sessions took place in nashville , i was a little disappointed . Though i know that neil is probably too old to write `` Ragged Glory 2 '' or even `` Tonight 's the night 2 '' , i never liked Harvest and Harvest Moon as other people did . Harvest was a masterpiece and i like it but i prefer many other albums from the man . I 'm not against being mellow or country , i just did n't liked the `` sound '' of it ... Also , i did n't like much of the late songwriting he did . I was expecting a Harvest Moon , or worse , a Silver and Gold , which are `` sufficient '' albums for my tastes . I 'm surprised tough
 A new MASTERPIECE is born
 Okay , I am listening to Neil Young 's latest release and what are these people who are giving it only one or two stars talkin ' about ? This is great stuff ! This is classic Neil ! It 's not time for him to `` retire '' as one inept reviewer claimed , it 's time for him to fly even higher ... burn even brighter ... It used to take at least two listenings of a Neil Young recording to decide whether or not I liked it but that 's when I was young and foolish . Now I can tell from the moment the music begins because I now understand that Neil 's music is not something one can superficially appreciate , Neil is the `` realest of the real '' and although he says he does n't know where the music comes from , I know , as every `` true '' fan knows , this music comes from deep within his spirit ... his soul ... Neil Young is Mr. Soul himself!For those who whined about the overproduction of this recording , put down the crack pipe and realize the Truth that Neil can never be a `` sellout '' . It 's just not in his blood . You sold out when you gave this recording a bad review.Neil Young is too much a part of my psyche to abandon him now . I 'm not saying that he 's infallible ... he 's quite fallible . He 's not the greatest singer , he 's not the greatest musician but it is his raw humanity and his true humble willingness to bow down before the gods of creativity that make Neil Young one of the greatest and when he goes , the world will be a lonelier place.LONG LIVE NEIL YOUNG !!!!
 Well , Neil Young has graced with yet another album in his long , well-documented career . And while `` Prairie Wind '' might not be his best , it is a noble , heartfelt effort.Upon first listen , I must admit I was a little dissapointed at the lyrical content and wistfulness of the album . Sure , the songs are catchy , but there is nothing that compares to the goosebump-raising opening to `` Old Man '' from Harvest or even the joy of something like `` Cripple Creek Fairy '' from After the Goldrush . It seemed as if Neil was indeed getting old and growing slightly too reminiscent . Where 's the lyrical genious of `` Do n't Let It Bring You Down '' or the anger of the Greendale ? All of these forementioned cons aside , I can totally see why he looks back on his youth after the roller-coaster type of year he 's had.Prairie Wind starts off with `` The Painter '' a nice , slow acoustic number that features some great steel guitar work by Ben Keith . It 's a good song , it wo n't end up being classic , although to chorus is pretty catchy . `` No Wonder '' is one of the strongest songs on this album , with its fast , hard-core countryish sound . The writing on this song is quite strong , with references to 9-11 , Willie Nelson , Chris Rock . `` Falling Off the Face of the Earth , '' while not representing anything new , is a wonderful , little heartfelt melody . The soft , acoustic lick , the background singers
 It 's hard to be objective about new material when you 're a Neil Young fan . However , I am not in love with all of his work . Prairie Wind is a great effort and the finished material is very well done . Someone described `` Greendale '' as a `` demo tape '' that became a CD . Greendale is an excellent piece of work as well and I can not argue the `` rough around the edges '' sound but you have to consider how Neil `` hears '' his work re-produced . Crazy Horse -LRB- Greendale -RRB- vs. basically The International Harvesters -LRB- Prairie Wind -RRB- are a long way apart in concept and sound . These songs are heartfelt and very personal in nature , revealing things about Neil 's life that have rarely gone beyond the private circle of his family and friends . When he has said `` I heard Emmy Lou 's voice or , Ben Keith 's steel guitar when I wrote these songs '' , we are listening to what must be his replication of that sound on the finished product . Many of Neil 's albums must be heard several times and more frequently than not , they will grow on you . Prairie Wind is one of these . I am amazed at Neil 's marketing skills to reach out to the listener with a DVD of the work being filmed live during the recording sessions . The interaction between Neil , his friend 's and the musicians are a visual testimony to just how important the music really is to him . I am certain that the Nashville concert film with these performances , when it is released , will be outstanding as well . So , I rate Prairie Wind as one of the best pieces of Neil 's work that I have . And , I basically have all of his releases .
 Just finished listening to the CD my standouts are . . It 's a Dream , Far From Home . Check out the chord structure on This Old Guitar borrowed from Harvest Moon . As a previous reviewer stated it 's just slightly better than Greendale , but not much .
 Prairie Wind is a very good cd , certainly one of Neil Young 's best since the cd it 's so often compared to , Harvest Moon . The closer , `` When God Made Me '' , questioning whether there is only one way to worship god versus a more individual approach , is a real gem . The song before it , `` He was the King '' -LRB- referring to Elvis , that is -RRB- , stands out as a bit of a clunker in the set both in it 's lyrical content and it 's forced `` tossed off '' approach . But overall the songs are very good and it 's well recorded with good musicians . Any fan of Young 's acoustic oriented material should enjoy this cd.Those looking for a recent Young `` masterpiece '' though should perhaps look to his `` Greendale '' cd instead . Though not as accessible with it 's minimally constructed songs -LRB- and some clocking in around the ten minute mark -RRB- , the cd recorded with Crazy Horse demonstrates Young 's gift to act as a lightening rod to inspiration . `` Greendale '' ranks with his absolute best and without question is his best work of the last twenty years .
 A wonderfull album with some of the strongest songs Young has written . `` It 's a Dream '' is stunning an older man 's reflections on a similar theme to `` Do n't be Denied '' 30 years earlier.This is my album of the year , to date , in a strong year with very good albums from Ry Cooder , The Stones , McCartney & Richard Thompson .
 I think this is one of the best CDs Neil has ever done . I do n't understand the criticism . Beautiful album , by an absolute legend .
 Like Johnny Cash , Neil 's been everywhere , man . Which means that the occasional quiet , unassuming , unpretentious country-folk record is perfectly welcome . This happens to be a quiet , unassuming , unpretentious country-folk record . Draw your own conclusions . This is a good record for sure , but it 's a couple songs short of being a crowning achievement like , say , After the Gold Rush . It 's not overproduced , it 's melodic , it 's relaxing , there 's a horn section that sounds good but slightly out-of-place . Really , what else do you need to know ? Oh yeah , what songs are good and what songs are n't . My favorite is the intense `` No Wonder '' , followed by the longish , reflective title track and the depressed `` Painter '' - I also enjoy the quiet , brief `` Fallin ' off the Face of the Earth '' and the hymnal `` When God Made Me '' -LRB- though the choir is a bit much -RRB- . I suppose that , if I was a jerk , I could slag `` Far from Home '' for being exaggerated and syrupy , but the truth is I like that one too . It 's just exaggerated and syrupy , that 's all . Now when Neil opens up a bottle of Aunt Jemima and pours it everywhere , like he does on the Elvis tribute `` He Was the King '' , `` It 's a Dream '' and `` Here for You '' , that 's where the problems start to set in . I hope you like cheese , because between those three songs there 's a lot of gorgonzola . Good thing that he mostly forgets about the aforementioned metaphorical dairy products and pancake toppings , and chooses instead to go for a quiet , subdued , genuinely heartfelt album in a day and age where self-centered angst means money in the bank .
 This is a great CD to add to your Neil Young collection . His songs are very well written and preformed .
 I found Prarie Wind to be one of those albums that you play over and over again until the song order is etched in your memory so much that you start humming the next song just as the previous one is finishing . Kind of ateenage/college habit that has reappeared as I reach retirement and pre-senility . The theme of the album isalso along those lines too . It 's a collection of Neil 's songs about an age , a generation . The line , `` too much time took away his head '' is an example along with the empty-nest message of `` Here For You '' . As a parentwhose kids have left home to begin their adventure it sure hits home . Neil 's tremendous range of abilities isso evident in this country collection but the signature is still his . If you really want to enjoy this take a look at hisDVD `` Heart of Gold '' and you 'll see this CD visually . Worth the cost anyway you look at it or listen to it .
 I just finished listening to this for about the 5th time . This is a stirring and beautiful piece of work for Mr Young . His vocal and lyrics are palpable with emotion and the stripped down effect of he and his guitar with a outstanding band made me feel his music.This is one of his best , do yourself a favor and listen to this album and read the lyrics.Thanks Neil .
 Very nice CD . Love to order from Amazon . Can listen to samples and this really helps to choose . Enjoyable Neil Young CD .
 If you are not up , dancing around the room to `` He Was The Kig , '' Neil 's ode to Elvis , you need to see a doctor .
 After listening to this album , one can definitely hear that Neil Young has turned a corner in his life . Great listening , and the quality of the recording on the dvd is outstanding .
 ... stealing cars and having a wife in every port?No!Not THAT Neil -LRB- Cassidy -RRB- ! I mean , he also admits he 's doing always the same things
 J' &eacute;tais sceptique quant &agrave; la qualit&eacute; du nouvel album de Neil Young , `` Prairie Wind '' . Depuis `` Broken Arrow '' en 1996 , aucun album , mis &agrave; part peut-tre `` Silver and Gold '' , qui contient toutefois quelques chansons ordinaires -LRB- `` Buffalo Springfield Again '' , `` Razor Love '' , qui ont toutefois &eacute;t&eacute; les plus populaires -LRB- allez savoir pourquoi ! -RRB- , n ' a su v&eacute;ritablement me charmer . `` Are You Passionate ? '' me semble tre le moins bon Young des 10 derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es , alors que `` Greendale '' contient quelques chansons int&eacute;ressantes , mais rien pour casser la baraque , et `` Road Rocks '' , un album `` live '' somme toute ordinaire , aussi ordinaire que le jeu de drums de Keltner qui prend tout l'avant-sc &egrave;ne . Avec `` Prairie Wind '' , finalement , on retrouve un Neil Young &eacute;videmment d&eacute;chir&eacute; par la mort de son p&egrave;re -LRB- `` It 's A Dream '' , entre autres -RRB- . On retrouve un auteur qui , de toute sa carri&egrave;re , -LRB- re -RRB- fait ce qu'il a toujours su faire le mieux
 Lazy Journalism . Every time Neil makes an acoustic or countryish album , its hailed as a sequel to Harvest or the 3rd part in the apparent Trilogy after Harvest Moon . Only problem - reviews have said that about `` comes a time '' , `` old ways '' , and `` silver and gold '' already . Lazy lazy lazy.This album stand on its own , with 3 tracks instant classics - tracks 1 , 2 , and 10 . Best album in 11 years , but does n't quite reach the heights of `` sleeps with angels '' , only slightly better than `` greendale '' . Overall this is recommended .
 Neil Young has a nasal , sometimes annoying voice . His saving grace is that he writes great songs . This album has several , centred firmly on the Canadian prairie . The style is country rock - tending to the softer end of the spectrum but the lyrics are perceptive , sometimes whimsical and longing , often biting . For example , he describes the joyous scene of a wedding in a church he 's previously described as `` the fallen soldier bell '' . There are elements of nostalgia and undercurrents of bitterness -LRB- `` Somewhere a senator sits in a leather chair ... He takes his money just like all the rest . '' -RRB- . There 's sweetness and love for both people present and those past . There are many lovely pictures in words.The more I 've played this , the more I like it . I have a few albums that I simply ca n't put away . This is one .
 Strong , pretty melodies . Even after classic after classic , Neil still can write a beautiful melody . Lyrically intelligent and musically brilliant.Another keeper from Mr. Eclectic .
 A must buy . Neil Young is an enduring classic and if you 've enjoyed his folk rock over the years , you will certainly mellow out when you listen to his latest CD . `` Just a Dream '' is especially good listening .
 I 've spent my whole life listening to this guy , and he never dissapoints.Friends , times and places come and go , Neil never fails to deliver . God blessCanada for sharing Neil with us all these years . I first was made aware of Prarie Wind by watching the DVD of the Nashville concert with Emmylou . Itwas spectacular by the way and I had to have the CD . It 's the easiest five stars I 've ever given out . The songs rattle around in my brain along with Neil 's signature hardscrabble guitar riffs . There 's not a bad song to be found on here . Prarie Wind -LRB- Blowing Through My Head -RRB- just makes me shake my head and wonder how Neil does it . No Wonder and Falling Off The Face Ofthe Earth are outstanding .
 Another positive review for this album . Some wonderful tracks here that just get more enjoyable with repeated playing . Young 's voice keeps getting mellower and sweeter . Plus , his songs have great message . Great work , Neil .
 Awonderfuland ddply felt Cc , which he thought might be his farewell , pending brain surgery , which wqs successful A Classis .
 I got this within a couple of days of its release . There are some very nice songs on it and an overall mood that suggests Neil was appreciating the vibe of these songs and knew his audience was going to love them . The last year or so has been rough on Mr. Young and it 's a wonder he was able to get this project completed . This is all acoustic with backing band . Of course , it 's been compared to Harvest since the day it came out . So let 's just use Harvest as a comparison . If you like Harvest you will not be dissapointed with Prairie Wind . At least that 's my opinion .
 With all of the albums that Neil Young has turned out over the years , this may be his best.From the soulful tunes that we have come to expect from him to his use of words which is unexcelled , I found this to be a totally satisfying experience . Very reminiscent of `` Harvest Moon ''
 At first I was n't really thrilled with this one . It 's been a while since I dipped into the new NEIL YOUNG files . The last new release I purchased was Broken Arrow back in '96 and that ai n't nothing like this . But , my moms got me this one , and she told me to give it a few listens . She tends to dig the soft side of Neil , while I tend to go for the hard grind version , but usually wemeet in the middle ; so I gave it a few listens.The first song I liked the best , and was a little skeptical on the rest at first . . but the first track THE PAINTER , I liked . Then however , after a few more listens , I really started to feel this thing . Unlike 2003 's Greendale , which sounded sloppily mixed together , this album features a rich mix , of lullabye like songs and dirges.The vocal tracks are extremely cool . They seem to cut through you from time to time . It really stands out on NO WONDER , the second song , which starts to take on a darker feel everytime you listen.Some of these tunes are upbeat in a Harvest sort of way . Theres no bleeding Crazy Horse here . The title track is a honky style romper , with brass . . almost like a Van Morrison track , I like that one . I even enjoyed HE WAS THE KING , with Neil Young cracking a few stale jokes at the end . . `` Elvis has left the arena ! '' -LRB- ah ha ha ha , you jolly bastard ... -RRB- Anyway . Neil Young always seems to grow on me . I have a good ton of his 35 plus albums , and the fun is you never know what he 's coming out with yet . If you like his country/acoustic style stuff , I can reccommend . I actually like this better than his hugely succesful Harvest Moon album , so yeah , I 'm talking to all you peeps who flocked towards that one . This record is for you . Its a new season of Harvest .
 I 've been looking forward to four albums this year , all of which were promised to be really good from industry insiders.The first two , `` A Bigger Bang '' by the Rolling Stones and `` Chaos & Creation in the Backyard '' by Paul McCartney were both good records that grew on you with repeated listenings . Bravo.Then came `` Prairie Wind '' by Neil Young , followed by `` Rapture of the Deep '' by another legendary act , Deep Purple.Well , Neil has kept up his end of this `` four way '' promoise and came through with a good solid effert . A couple of tracks are descended to be classics.The first time I played the album I was thinking `` two stars '' but after a number of listens , it 's more of a `` three and a half stars '' effert . Bravo Neil.That 's three album 's down and now it 's Rapture of the Deep . What a nice surprise , a real winner , I give Deep Purple a rare `` five star '' rating for their latest . It 's a testament to a `` dinosaur '' band that is still very hungry with important things to write about . It 's what European fans and press are calling a Purple masterpiece!Prairie Wind = 3 1/2 stars
 a life threatening ailment and/or the passing of an important person from your life can make you pause and reflect . on `` prarie wind '' neil is in a reflective mood . the disc opens with `` the painter '' , an infectious melody which might be construed as an ode to a certain fellow canadian musician neil has been linked to since the early days . `` no wonder '' employs the same musical motif as `` the old homestead '' from `` hawks and doves '' and laments the current environmental condition , by comparing it with the prarie of his childhood . `` falling off the face of the earth '' is a heart display . `` far from home '' recounts the family sing-a-longs of his youth `` that left a big mark '' on him . the horns help to give it a raucous feel . `` it 's a dream '' is perhaps the most beatiful song neil has ever recorded . a poignant reflection on the ephemeral nature of life , it is reminiscent of some of the best van morrison has to offer . the title tune is a soulful affair that combines funky horns and effective backing vocals which include those from spouse pegi young . `` here for you '' seems like it might be for his children , something any parent can relate to . `` this old guitar '' is about the instrument he plays throughout the recording , which once belonged to hank williams -LRB- background vocals by emmylou -RRB- . `` he was the king '' was probably more fun for neil to record then it is for his fans to listen to ; the only dispensable song in the bunch . the closing song is `` when god made me '' , a diatribe concerning the current lack of religious tolerance in this country cleverly cloaked in christian church music . a fine mature offering from neil . the DVD shows the disc being recorded , good if you 're interested in the process .
 The CD arrived within one week in the stated condition . Will definitely use this reseller again .
 This is the 1st Young album I 've bought in many years . Probably the last thing I purchased by him was Re * Ac * Tor a long long time ago . `` Prairie Wind '' is a very nicely recorded and performed work , but some of it could have been better . Too many slow tunes . Tracks 8 , 9 and 10 drag down the album , `` When God Made Me '' not a good way to end the CD , a faster more guitar-oriented track would have been a better closer . And that song about Elvis ? Filler , very inane lyrics . Some electric guitar would have been nice too , although I suppose Neil 's aim with this particular project was a full acoustic recording . I always loved all the great guitar on classic tracks such as `` Cinnamon Girl , '' `` Down By The River '' and many many others . I hope in the future , Young will someday go back to a straight rock & roll album . The same could be said for Sir Paul McCartney . Good new album but not enough rockers .
 I am a huge fan of catchy , country-folk music with insightful lyrics . If you enjoy this album then I strongly recommend that you check out the following :1 -RRB- Ghosts Of The Great Highway by Sun Kil Moon2 -RRB- Kings Avenue Joe Kile3 -RRB- Subtitulo by Josh Rouse4 -RRB- Banjos and Sunshine by Sixty Acres
 This is an essential Neil Young album . Taking yet another turn in his long , interesting and forever relevant career Neil follows a country rock muse and his words and music is delivered in a heltfelt and moving way that is straight from his soul . Neil faced several personal traumas during 2005 , not the least the death of his father and his own health concerns which he has since rebounded from in emphatic fashion.The Painter opens this strong set with its whistful acoustic guitar progression and gentle steel pedal guitar giving it a real country feel . You will note that his voice is as tender and melodic as it has ever been . This song was nominated for a Grammy and it ai n't hard to see why . `` If you follow every dream , you might get lost `` As someone else pointed out , No Wonder is vintage Neil Young in every sense of the statement . It is really melodic and has great tempo changes . He may as well have recorded this with CSNY all those years ago . Being a guitar player I rate this his best acoustic riff since My My Hey Hey . `` no wonder were loosing time `` Falling Of The Face of The Earth features a rough around the edges falsetto , that 's the great thing about Neil , he does n't care if his songs are not 100 % perfect technically . Just listen to the words and the music.Far From Home kicks up the dust a bit , here we have a joyous uptempo song where Neil recalls his upbringing on the Prairie , `` those were the good family times that left a big mark on me `` It 's A Dream is enough to bring a tear in ones eye . It is such a beautiful song , one of the best he ever did , for sure one of his best melodies and musical arrangements.Prarie Wind features some female backup singers and is more of an uptempo song with Neil exercising his vocals a little.Here For You is similar to a song you would find on his `` Comes A Time '' album . It features lovely pedal steel guitar and harmonica from Neil . There is a vulnerable warble to his voice.This Old Guitar is about how the guitar will outlive its owner . Neil plays Hank Williams guitar on the DVD Heart Of Gold which I highly recommend as he plays this song on the guitar , along with the other songs from this album and several acoustic classics spanning his career . `` Were gon na start in an F '' ? , son Ben agrees so Neil begins his goofy little song about the king that adds a light hearted moment to this largely introspective album.The final track , `` When God Made Me '' has a lovely spiritual tone and was a fitting performance at the Katrina Benefit Concert.This is one of Neils best and consistent albums and I rank it up with his very best that includes Rust Never Sleeps , Harvest , Everyone Knows This Is Nowhere , After The Goldrush and On The Beach.Neil Young is a gift to the world , and there is no one like him , thankyou Neil for keeping it real , after all of these years , still rocking in the free world . You are Mr Soul .
 Prairie Wind return Neil to his folk-country material . There 's a few minor differences with this release compared to the rest of his folkier outputs . Neil employs horn sections on a few of his best cuts like Long Way Home , and He was the King . The songs are stalker and more mature than the rest of his folk records . It works like a charm with the wheezing harmonica and banjos Neil sounds pretty good for his age , but you can tell he is an old man . His voice does not have the same energy and punch anymore . Yet , for a person in his early 60 's , he ca n't be touched . Take for instance , Eric Clapton 's Back Home . Clapton 's voice is gone and his music has been contemptorary for a long time . The rolling stones need to retire . They still commercialize their music like they acutally need the money , it makes me sick . So , if anyone is going to tell Neil to hang it up , you should tell many of the others in that age cateogry to do the same . Neil 's material despite his age is still better than anyone else his age .
 I began listening to Neil Young when I was a teenager , some thirty years ago . Back then people would say , `` I guess that David Crosby , Stephen Stills and Graham Nash are giving Young a break . '' They would then go on to muse about his `` weird '' or `` mediocre '' voice while praising his abilities as a songwriter . Then as now , there is one fact that must be taken into consideration here
 the reason to buy the DVD is the hi resolution soundtrack . So smooooooooth you may wind up not playing the CD again any time soon except in the car . Not that the CD is n't anything short of excellent . It 's just that it 's a CD . I 'm not suggesting you go out and spend your hard-earned dough on one of those over-priced hi-end get-ups . The 24-bit 96 kHz soundtrack on the DVD can be played on any decent DVD player and played through your stereo or home theatre system and it 'll sound great . You can enjoy the music and it 'll sound as good as Neil meant it to sound . Take it from him and go out and get the DVD.The studio recording sessions are an added bonus !!!!
 A big Neil Young fan in the 60s and 70s , I had n't followed his music in many years -LRB- or any other popular music , for that matter -RRB- . One of my 8th grade students , knowing how I feel about the war in Iraq , gave me Neil 's LIVING WITH WAR . I loved it , so I checked out reviews of PRAIRIE WIND , and I bought it . As far as I 'm concerned , it 's a masterwork . The songs are incredibly moving , especially for someone who is Neil 's age . I love this man for having made it .
 When I picked this up tuesday I listened to it once , twice , again and again . This album has an ambiance that is amazing . All the tracks are tops . This is Neil taking stock of his times and his roots . `` tick tock - the clock on the wall - no wonder were losing time '' Greendale was an amazing record , but Prarie Wind is an all emcompassing statement of an artist who has the words but wisdom to keep it simple . Buy this record , it will be one of the Neil Young lp 's that you keep coming back too . Honest , Reflective , Dark , Prarie Wind is his masterwork .
 I have long been a Neil Young fan . His music `` rings home '' to me . The music resonates as far back as the `` Crosby , Stills , Nash , and Young '' days . `` Prairie Wind '' is one of Young 's best works . The album is one excellent performance followed by another.The music is symphony-like and captivating.I purchased the CD and the `` Heart of Gold '' DVD the same day . Subsequent to listening to `` Prairie Wind '' , I said , `` Wow ! '' . I like the inclusion of the lyrics on the CD jacket . After viewing the DVD , I said , `` Spectacular ! '' . If a singer/songwriter should write about that which he knows , and a performer perform with both knowledge and heart-felt emotion , then these performances define success . As a son of the Prairie , I say `` Five stars . '' and `` Two thumbs up ! '' .
 By now I 'm sure everyone knows who Neil Young is , so I 'll just start by saying that some people might look at Prairie Wind as the album that almost did n't happen . Not only did Neil lose his father and the mother of his first child prior to its recording , but he also suffered a brain aneurysm DURING its recording . Fortunately , though , all this seemed to give him the motivation he needed to produce one of his best albums.My favorite song is the title track , but another song not to miss is `` He Was the King '' , a silly but funky tribute to Elvis Presley . Those are really the only upbeat songs on here , but Neil does still score with mellow songs , like `` The Painter '' and especially `` It 's a Dream '' . `` Here For You '' is also an interesting take on the I 'll - be-there-for-you ballad.Neil 's vocal has always had sort of an acquired taste -LRB- see `` Falling Off the Face of the Earth '' -RRB- , which is why this album gets 4-1/2 stars instead of 5 . But songs like `` This Old Guitar '' makes you forget all about that . Prairie Wind is a nice breezy album that you ought to have in your collection.Anthony Rupert
 Prairie Wind was an outstanding CD . Once i heard it i had to keep playing it over and over . Hey Marty From Nashville ! Your an idiot for thinking it sucked . you do n't know Neil Young 's music . this was a great mix of amazing music . some of neil young 's best . Marty it is you who sucks .
 Neil Young made this album with his heart and sings from his soul . I find it comprable in a way to `` Harvest Moon '' -LRB- which I love -RRB- but with more guts .
 I was feeling a little out of the loop the other day while listening to the tune `` No Wonder '' from this record . I mean , I dunno what Chris Rock said about much of anything , except maybe tossed salad . And what does any of that have to do with Willie Nelson ? Well , thank le bon dieu for Google , a quick search brings up a reference to a post 9/11 concert Neil played at , in which he was surrounded by candles while performing John Lennon 's `` Imagine . '' And Chris made a joke about it , but then is `` Do n't send no more candles , no matter what you do '' really all THAT memorable.Apparently , it was for Neil , and that 's the kind of stream-of-consciousness moment I always liked in Neil Young tunes . The Amazon writer above uses the word `` elliptical '' in reference to this song , and that just about says it all . Neil Young is NOT all that linear , even when he starts out to be . Dylan can go from obscurantism to story teller mode in the bat of an ice blue eye . Neil Young has never struck me as a master of narrative , really
 Neil Young 's 2005 release `` Prairie Wind '' is a strong album , and had it not been because the album loses some of its clarity towards the end I might have to have ranked it up among great works such as `` After the Gold Rush '' and `` Harvest . '' There is as soft melodic country touch to many of the songs , and many actually have a similar sound to his classic 1970 's albums . Lyrically , though , there has been a change and the themes of his songs are generally darker.The opening song `` The Painter '' is a very beautiful composition that makes you look out for your guitar to figure out how it goes . This is surely a classic . `` No Wonder '' is great too , maybe more traditional in its structure , but with lyrics that give rise for reflection . `` Falling Off The Face Of The Earth '' has a great verse line - reminds me a lot about Lou Reed . The falsetto part does not quite live up to the verse , but generally it 's a great song too , with nice tasteful organ in the background . `` Far From Home '' and `` It 's Dream '' is both sad songs - the first a bluesy tune with both horns , harmonica and slide guitar , whereas the second is a slow waltzy song . There is also some nostalgia in the lyrics of the title-track `` Prarie Wind '' - one of the few blues-rockers on the album , the longest track , too . `` Here For You '' is a melodic ballad which in spite of steel guitar and strings has a naked honesty to it . `` This Old Guitar '' is quite nice , but best remembered for the guest-appearance of Emmylou Harris . `` He was the King '' has a live unplugged feel to it , and the closing track `` When God Made Me '' is a gospel kind of tune . Without being weak are the last numbers of the album make to lose a little strength , and my favorites are among those first seven .
 I have watched the performance on cable several times and had to buy the DVD . I have read reviews where some did n't like this album ... did n't like what Neil Young had done . I see this as a product of his maturation and professional evolution . We all mellow out eventually and I love hearing this music . Neil Young has traveled a long journey and this album was a welcome addition to my collection . I never grow tired of it .
 First off , I 'm no Neil Young expert . I 'm simply someone who was introduced to Neil Young 's music by a friend , some 15 years ago . I do n't own every Neil album - not even close . But Young fascinates me , and when he releases the kind of album that I think I 'll like , I buy it.This does n't strike me as the 3rd piece to a Harvest trilogy . Neither did `` Silver and Gold '' . But this album comes closer to ranking with the 2 ` Harvest ' classics . There 's a lot more depth and added instrumentation to this album.Some of the best
 This is Neil Young as he was in the early seventies , only aged like a fine wine . For those , like myself , who wore out several copies of the Harvest album , I recommend Prairie Wind . His soulful lyrics and haunting voice have n't changed over the decades .
 THE PAINTER ... if you follow every dream you might get lost . . I keep my friends eternally . . we leave our tracks in the sounds . . some of them are with me now . . some of them ca n't be found ... Prairie Wind just could be my favorite Neil Young and I have quite a Neil Young collection , maybe it 's just the magic of the lyrics . . it 's as if Neil and I have travelled the same road . . but really it 's the work of a legend and a master , one who can touch you 30 years ago and then again move you today as well as he did then . . and never sell out his integrity in music . . no Vegas act for Neil Young just soul-touching , memorable music .
 He finally did it ! Neil Young has recorded another masterpiece to stand alongside his 1972 album , Harvest . Full of honest emotion , beauty and variety , the colorful Prairie Wind -LRB- 2005 -RRB- is an ambitious work of art that reflects the life of Neil Young at 60 . During the recording of Prairie Wind , Young 's famous Canadian sportswriter dad passed away , and Neil himself had brain surgery to repair a life threatening aneurysm . Thoughts of his own mortality show up in various songs on the album , such as This Old Guitar , an acoustic guitar duet with Emmylou Harris.This old guitar ai n't mine to keep , It 's mine to play for a while , This old guitar ai n't mine to keep , It 's only mine for a while.The song is performed on Hank Williams ' old Martin guitar , and the singer realizes his guitar will outlive him , just as it has outlived it 's other famous owner . Here For You is a father 's touching letter to a daughter who has just left the nest , and many fathers of daughters will recognize themselves in this song even if their daughters are still at home . The Painter is a song that would have fit well on Harvest or Harvest Moon , and offers this advice : If you follow every dreamYou might get lostNo Wonder includes some solid acoustic guitar work from Young , and while an electric slide guitar wails , Neil sings of an `` old church on the hill '' , a `` fallen soldier bell '' , and a senator that `` took his money just like all the rest '' . Musically , the album features acoustic guitars , harmonica , pedal steel guitar , fiddle , electric guitars , a horn section , a church choir , piano , dobro , and an orchestra.He Was The King is a fun , rollicking , half satire , half tribute to Elvis , and the last song adresses a subject Young has been reticent about most of his career , his faith . In the hymn When God Made Me , Young sings about the world 's and his own relationship with God.Did He give us the gift of love , To say who we could choose , When God made meWhen God made me.Prairie Wind satisfies at every level . Musically , lyrically , emotionally . The prevailing theme is what Neil Young has on his mind at 60 years old , and as it turns out , these are the same things that most of of us have on our minds , too , whether we 're 60 or not . Come to think of it , quite a few of Neil Young 's albums are like that , but Prairie Wind also has images of Canadian geese , buffalo , Indian spirits , a weathered train station , old guitars , dreams , and a girl cousin that sings harmony .
 Simply one of the best CD 's I 've ever purchased . He has captured life in the moments of middle age that those of us from the 70 's can relate to in this chapter of our lives . VERY well done .
 Who would have guessed Neil Young could get any better ? This is a classic Neil Young sound . Incredible .
 I know that title might set off a lot of Neil 's fans , but I love this album and my wife and I often listen to it while making dinner at home together and never tire of it being in our shuffle of CDs playing .
 I remember finding this disc as a cut-out in a bin at some random record store , and getting the store owner to loan it to me for a day or two . Next thing I knew , I had bought it and was blasting it ALL THE TIME . But I can count the number of people who remember them on one hand . I put this group in that special category of acts that really ought to have gotten to the next level of fame and recognition , but for whatever reason , the timing or buzz just was n't right . Worth buying if you want to time-warp to 1990 and jam to some fun pop R&B . Also , DEFINITELY look at S.G. 's Butterflies album .
 This was one of M.C. Hammer 's many groups that he signed to his Bust It label . `` Spark of Love '' was the lead single . Great album ! Where are these guys now ? Very talented .
 As this CD is from Cleopatra , I was expecting remixes of songs from hit-makers The Sweet . Therefore , at first play I was very disappointed . But then I quickly got swept away.It 's a loose collection of outtakes , demos , rehearsal passes , & live tracks , so if you 're a fan it might take you a moment to adjust from the usual heavily-produced sheen we came to expect from The Sweet -- the work is worth it . For instance , the first track , `` Blockbuster , '' totally beats up on the master tape 's headroom , & the big vocal chord that ends the chorus is badly distorted ... but this version is a little faster than the lope of the single , with some nice variations on vocals & guitar.Here 's some highlights . `` Fox on the Run '' is a first pass , with no drums & forgotten lyrics , yet charming . `` Sweet F.A. '' is a studio jam , as the band messes around with keyboards , a few lead guitar mistakes , & an accidental-sounding key change that they run with to end the track . This CD 's version of `` Action '' is a lot rawer than the single , almost punk in its drive & no guitar overdubs . The hard-rocking `` Cockroach '' is a tune I 've never heard before , with a wild guitar solo -- the band at its peak swagger . This version of `` Love is Like Oxygen '' -LRB- their last real hit -RRB- has some problems with levels , but is much less slick than the single -LRB- with a nice jazzy break at the halfway point -RRB- & so sounds more like the band 's previous work . The four live tracks at the end give you a good idea of how The Sweet dominated U.S. coliseums in the 1970s . All in all , a great addition to the collection of any fan of The Sweet & mid-1970s hard rock .
 Wow , I ca n't believe no one wrote a review for this yet ! This is fantastic , stompin ' stuff . It is quite original ; the sticker on the CD wrapper describes it as `` Grim Germanic Thrash '' - a fair description , but inadequate ! I hear elements of thrash , black metal , viking metal , and some doomy gothic/industrial . Maybe like ... Rammstein meets Falkenbach ? Probably not a great comparison but it 's difficult to describe!Much of this music has a very strong , heavy , rhythmic , marching quality to it , there is also some keyboard use in very interesting , enhancing ways . And , I do n't know if this is the production or what , but the whole album has this amazing echo-like quality to it , as if it was recorded in some great huge hall.The languages of the songs vary - some English , a lot of German -LRB- which sounds particularly powerful with the thrashy music ! -RRB- and another language I can not determine . The guy 's voice is absolutely amazing , very doomy/gothic , very powerful-sounding . Here 's a song-by-song breakdown :1 . Ragnarok - 10/10 - a standout ! `` Ragnarok '' chants gives it an especially epic feel . Not sure what language it 's in , but sounds cool ! 2 . Shock & Awe - 7/10 - This one 's in English , pure poetry against American policy in Iraq . Musically it is not as interesting as the other songs -LRB- hence the 7 -RRB- but the lyrics are strong .3 . Erlkonig - 10/10 - slower in tempo , very stompin ' sound , his voice is incredible on this one ! This guy has growly and clean vocals that are equally amazing .4 . Army of Odin - 11/10 - Total standout !!! AMAZING !!! Again , his voice works wonders . Great thrashy guitar . Great `` Army of Odin '' and `` Vikings of Midgard '' chants in the background . This is the song I heard first , and I bought the album just on the merit of this song .5 . Master Hunter - 10/10 - shifting tempos - slower tempo with strong drumming on a lot of parts along with the cool gothy vocals , then speeds up in other parts .6 . Rattenfanger - 8/10 - does n't stand out so much but still a solid slower-tempo track with strong guitars and German lyrics that go great with the music .7 . Grimmer than Ugly - 9/10 - another good solid track but not quite a stand-out , English lyrics on this one . A great marching quality to it that reminds me of some Viking metal .8 . Walpurgisnacht - 10/10 - This one is in 2 parts , making 9 tracks total . Very strong ! Varying tempos , in many parts has the slower marching feel typical of other songs on this album , then in certain parts breaks out in some fierce black metal sounding stuff ! Goes back in forth that way throughout the song , and ends the album very fiercly!In general , this album is very , very , very highly recommended to any fan of interesting , heavy music .
 If you have ever heard of Solefald the brilliant avant garde black metal band then you know what you are in for with this . One of the best industrial black metal albums I have ever encountered . I also recommend the works of Solefald , another brilliant black metal band on the cutting edge .
 This CD is one of the all-time greats in my collection . Belle et Fou literally has it all
 In 2006 Berlin acquired a new show ... and as realized by four star chef and events caterer Hans-Peter Wodarz and producer/director Arthur Castro , Belle Et Fou combines dance , theatre and refined culinary delights and is topped off with an exquisite soundtrack that is produced and compiled by none other than Jazzanova!This soundtrack features new material from Jazzanova as well as several amazing hand-picked selections from the Sonar Kollektiv label 's back-catalogue . Orchestral soul is the predominant ` genre ' on the soundtrack , however we see a wide-ranging plethora of influence and style when we examine this 70 minute collection of aural ecstasy in greater detail.Take for instance , Micatone 's `` D-D-D-Dance , '' -LRB- from their 2005 release Nomad Songs -RRB- which builds the funky groove with shakers , deep funky bass and vocals that make you want to strut your stuff all the way down your block!Once you 've had your dancing fill and would like to take it a little slower , this soundtrack has got you covered ! Just take a listen to the live recording of Jazzanova ft. Clara Hill performing `` That Night '' at the Sonar Kollektiv Office , and not only will the pure beauty of Clara 's voice and the professionalism that Jazzanova play their instruments with bring a tear to your eye , but will firmly establish that the sweetness of this sound is coming from a very real and heartfelt place in this life.Don ' t be fooled , this soundtrack is coming full-range and represents sounds from a higher-realization on Jazzanova 's angelic downtempo ` killer of a track , ' `` Sirens . '' This cinematic arrangement is both lush and wondrous in texture and uses sounds of the female voice as an instrument -LRB- as opposed to a vehicle through which words bring imagery to mind -RRB- gently melded with acoustic guitar , harp and smooth bass sounds to form a song that could easily be mistaken for the feeling of soaring along mountain tops on the back of a majestic bird in flight .
 This is the bomb , Kids - Oh Yeah - really wonderfully creative sound - fresh beats , deep rythmn and overall just really cool .
 Chill-sexy-funky-jetset-loungy-retro-jazzy-downtempo hipnessI do n't know how ` Belle ' manages to span the genres yet maintain some semblance of continuity , but it surely . ` Belle ' is one of those compilations that instantly elevates your mood . You can hardly play it w/o someone asking , ` Who is that ? ` Melodius ... mellifluous ... sublime
 Based on the traditional American folksong , this compelling tale recounts the daring adventures of one family 's escape from slavery via the Underground Railroad . This touching story captures all the drama of a perilous flight to freedom . Told by Morgan Freeman , Music by Taj Mahal . The video won New York Festivals Gold Medal , Parents ' Choice Silver Honors , and Chicago International Children 's Film Festival . Great for all ages , especially ages 4 and up !
 It 's hard to believe that Buddy Guy 's first album , `` Left My Blues in San Francisco '' was n't released until 1967 , but at that time the Chess brothers simply did not know what to do with the young bluesman.Buddy first moved to Chicago in 1957 . After cutting four sides for the Cobra label , he signed with Chess records mainly as a sideman for Muddy Waters , Howlin ' Wolf and Willie Dixon . During this time , Buddy recorded in a style influenced by B.B. King , but he longed to stretch out as a showman and `` blast that thing '' in the style of Guitar Slim , a wild player from Guy 's home state of Louisiana . `` San Francisco '' is an example of Buddy 's style right before leaving Chess , playing in a restrained manner heavy on soul.One of the reasons this album works so well is the production and tenor sax work of Gene Barge . Known as `` Daddy G '' , Barge plays the solos on Koko Taylor 's `` Wang Dang Doodle '' -LRB- Buddy is on this track also -RSB- and all of Gary `` U.S. '' Bonds ' hits.He knew where to add horns and when to spotlight Guy 's guitar . `` She Suits Me to a Tee '' makes it 's first appearance here , as does the rollicking `` Every Girl I See '' . The soulful groove throughout the album shows a style different from his later recordings . Of course , many superior albums would follow over the decades , but `` San Francisco '' is a great snapshot of the young Guy finding his voice.The Universal Japan import is remastered and contains three extra tracks-well worth the extra few dollars .
 Imperative Reaction combines the depressing lyrics of American industrial bands -LRB- Skinny Puppy , Nine Inch Nails , and Praga Khan -RRB- with the inspired , organized , and atmospheric electronic music of European industrial bands . Eulogy has some great tracks on it -LRB- Scorpio , The Longing , Overcast -RRB- , while some just seem like fillers . Overall , I think this a great debut release for Imperative Reaction , and that they should be commended for implementing the more European style to their sound .
 If you love industrial , this album is a terrific way to get a lot of music from a crucial time in the development of the genre . They were halcyon days , at least for me.There are reasons to fault the album ; the lyrics and cover art , but as an artifact and representation of the genre , it is overwhelmingly exceptional . Get this one before trying any other Imperative Reaction , or maybe even before trying any other industrial.Regards , proclus -LSB- ... -RSB-
 I buy a lot of EBM and industrial music and this album is by far my newest favorite for the year . I love industrial dance of this quality and every track on the album is strong . The music is complex with simple melodies layered into delicately harsh vocals and strong industrial dance-beats , and yet sustain excellent musical form . I was quite surprised to discover the band is based in the US because I would expect the sound to come out of Belgium or Germany . The closest bands I can relate them to are all on Metropolis - Wumpscut , Informatik , Decoded Feedback , etc. .
 With Industrial music hitting the wall lately , the lack of originality and innovation in much of the material in this genre persuaded some to seek out more challenging music . Imperative Reaction may fall into the dreaded ` Industrial Dance ' category , but they do it exceptionally well and most of the songs on the band 's debut release ` Eulogy for a Sick Child ' are actually quite good . The style they have chose for their first release is nothing that many other bands like Funker Vogt , FLA , : Wumpscut : , Velvet Acid Christ , Lether Strip , etc. have n't already incorporated , but again , Imperative Reaction has a very good handle on this . This is textbook Industrial - growling vocals , jumpy synth-lines , four-on-the-floor pounding techno beats , movie samples , and the like , but what makes this release interesting is the tight grip IR seem to have on this style . Ted Phillips ' vocal approach is strangely close to Rudy Ratzinger 's on many tracks but in light of the recent : Wumpscut
 I 've always liked Imperative Reaction and somehow their music has managed to change in sync with my tastes . `` Eulogy for the sick child '' was a great album for it 's time and still has some catchy tunes .

 First , a little housekeeping . There are no biographical notes or recording information included with this set . The recordings are monaural , probably from the early 1950 's . The sound engineering is not displeasing , although the violin is often recorded very close up , with the piano slightly in the background and with somewhat limited dynamics . Two of the sonatas feature George Szell , the rest are with Horszowski . While Horszowski 's playing is tonally beautiful and always stylish , Szell plays with a little more expression and greater clarity , if with less tonal allure . While all the performances on this set are good , the two sonatas with Szell really come alive in a quite special way . Oscar Levant , when the original LP of the Szell recordings came out , stopped Szell on New York 's 57th St. to tell him how much he enjoyed the record . Szell 's reply was , `` I did n't know you cared for good music . '' These recordings should make you want to investigate Szell 's 1946 recordings of the Mozart Piano Quartets with the Budapest Qt . As for Szigeti , his playing is always full bodied , scrupulously phrased , and essentially joy giving . This is a classic set .
 These are wonderful historical recordings that are very well transferred . Most enjoyable is the patrician ` pianism ' by both Horszowski and , particularly , Szell -LRB- in K454 and K481 . -RRB- While the uninitiated may find Szigeti 's astringent and somewhat insecure tone unsettling , the reason for purchasing this set should be the delight imparted by the impeccable musicianship of the artists .
 There are no 2 star Glad albums ! Every album has been carefully crafted to Glorify God and Edify man . The music is 1st class , and used by many other bands during their set-ups for their concerts . If you are only looking for a cappella type songs you should not be surprised when you find both . They were schooled in vocals but have always been a band . I gave this album 4 stars only because there are many 5 star Glad albums and there needs to be a step here for the best albums . This album asks the question , who do you love ? And God Is My Rock was recorded first on this rock album .
 I enjoy all of the composers featured in this album , but I bought it because of Katchen 's gorgeous performance of Grieg 's piano concerto . I received this recording -LRB- in LP form -RRB- for Christmas when I was a teenager , and I loved it dearly . I have waited for it to be released on CD for years . Hooray!There are few performers these days who can equal the classical performers of the 20th century . When you get the chance to obtain a recording by one of these masters -- grab it .
 After buying a half-dozen of the `` Art of Julius Katchen '' volumes as expensive imports -LRB- see my reviews -RRB- , I too was finally able to take advantage of purchasing one of the domestic releases at a much lower price . I had not previously purchased this title , Volume 4 in the series , because I already owned Katchen 's accounts of the Liszt Piano Concertos with Argenta on a Decca Legends CD -LRB- see my review -RRB- . But the opportunity to hear Katchen perform the Grieg Concerto and an entire disc of solo works for piano , with the Liszt Concertos tossed in , was too great to pass up . The Grieg , with Kertesz conducting the Israel Philharmonic from 1962 , is very good but the Liszt Concertos are still the highlight in my opinion . The solo works on CD2 range from Mussorgssky 's `` Pictures at an Exhibition '' and Balakirev 's `` Islamey '' to three pieces by Liszt -- `` Mephistio Waltz No. 1 , '' `` Funerallies , '' and `` Hungarian Rhapsody No. 12 . '' These performances are all in mono -LRB- recorded between 1951 and 1955 -RRB- , and the sound and playing are both excellent . In all , this is a priceless set , even more enjoyable at a cheaper price .
 It 's a bit funny that this album has been reissued and remastered like this ... it was originally issued on vinyl as part of MCA/Chess 's `` Chess Blues Masters Series '' almost thirty years ago , and everything here is now available on either Wolf 's `` His Best '' or the three-disc `` Chess Box '' . But `` Change My Way '' is a fine album in its own right , drawing from Wolf 's 1959-1963 singles , many of which are in stereo . The sound is really good , and Hubert Sumlin plays fiery lead guitar on songs like `` Change My Way '' , `` My Mind Is Ramblin ' '' , and the funky `` Hidden Charms '' , which features one of the best electric guitar solos ever recorded.This is some of the finest , grittiest electric blues you 'll ever hear ... a terrific , stylistically cohesive collection of prime Wolf . `` Change My Way '' would make quite a nice introduction to the Wolf , but it is not definitive , even though does contain a few lesser-known songs which usually are n't found on single-disc Wolf compilations . `` His Best '' and `` His Best vol . 2 '' , and `` The Chess Box '' , remain the best and most thorough Howlin ' Wolf-compilations and the very best place to start building your Wolf-collection .
 Wow , what a great CD . David 's voice is capitivating , and the songs very smart & original . `` Mercy on Me '' and `` Pyro '' get repeated spins in my CD player in my car . . anyone interested in a great sngwriter with an amazing performing presence should get this CD ! I first saw David perform in Los Angeles , and promptly got a copy of `` Pyro '' . . very cool music .
 If you 're here I 'll assume you 've already purchasedBoxerand realize that , though `` Mistaken for Strangers '' is an amazing song , it hardly characterizes the album . That said , `` Santa Clara '' levels everything off of Boxer with beautiful , somber glory . `` Blank Slate , '' on the other hand , is a bit more lighthearted than most of the National 's current material ; in fact , it 's a reworking of an old b-side called `` Keep it Upstairs '' off of the singleAbel.These b-sides perfectly compliment Boxer , but a $ 16.00 price tag for 2 songs is really misguided . Instead , check outSkin a Night & The Virginia Ep -LRB- 2pc -RRB- -LRB- W/CD -RRB- ! It has a total of 12 b-sides , including the ones from `` Mistaken for Strangers , '' and a movie about the making of the album for only $ 2 more than this single !
 this is a very good cd ... everyone that reads this should get a copy . Marc 's vocals are amazing and they have some very unique sounds throughout the album . This album comes in right after their other newer cd -LRB- The Inbetween Time -RRB- which is absolutly amazing . This is a great band , too bad they have split but atleast we can still enjoy their music .
 This one has everything ! Hard driving rock on a few tracks , to understated songs of quiet praise or longing . It took a few listens to get into , but the best albums always do . This album is a lynchpin in any rock collection , Christian or not .
 this CD is not all that bad . most of the tracks are not that hard -LRB- there are a few though -RRB- . their lyrics are deep . they express their feeling about God without coming out and saying the word God a thousand times , which is something i like .
 It 's truly remarkable when an artist is able to express both the pain that is felt in life , and the grace needed to overcome that pain . This album , in my opinion , is the quintessential example of how one can achieve this balance . Employing acoustic gems , near `` dream pop '' odes and post-punk thunderings , `` Delicate Fade '' paints a moving landscape through the `` sigh with a smile '' eyes of Marc Byrd . The opening violin of the brooding but hopeful `` Stains of Time '' is indicative of the rest of the album . The title track wraps lush harmonies and a mid-tempo arrangement around a sadly reflective theme , including a powerful outro . The more upbeat `` Eyes of God '' was a radio hit , and `` Drift '' pairs yearning lyrics with a pleasant acoustic guitar . `` Storm Boy '' has a haunting sentimentality , and `` Reprise '' is a beautiful reference to `` Broken Smile '' from the first record . Also , `` Firefly '' embraces a noise-light sound as a window into the writer 's mind , -LRB- `` Welcome to my life ... '' -RRB- . My favorite track is `` Strange Rain '' , with it 's rainy-day dream-pop arrangement and lamenting over the loss of innocence in growing older . Throughout the entire CD , the songs point to the fact that God is the One responsible for being able to make it through everything , -LRB- which is especially evident in `` Blue Raft '' and `` Whisper '' -RRB- . One of the best albums I have ever owned .
 This cd can make you cry and give you hope at the same time . I am really really confused why they did n't get alot more attention from the secular and Christian world . This cd is really well put together .
 I am a musician . I own around 500 CDs and listen to a varity of music from classic Jazz , to metal , to southern Gospial , to just about anything else you can imagin . If I had to give up all but one CD in my collection , this would be the one I would keep .
 Fans of the debut album from Common Children will be surprised to find a new album far removed from the original sound of this trio . A possible step away from the Nirvana comparisons garnered from Skywire , Delicate Fade is an album which swings wildly from jangly-guitar modern rock to heavy post-punk to fuzzed out moodiness in the style of Pink Floyd . Although the combination of different sounds would not seem to work , the Children have somehow fused together these diverse sonic landscapes to craft an album of great impressiveness . The overall gist of the album is the grace and love of God in the midst of the pain we experience in life . In reference to the old desert island , three albums question , this particular cd would definitely make my final cut . The maturation of Marc Byrd 's lyrics and the intricate guitar work draw me back to this album again and again . It is unfortunate that such talented bands receive such little recognition . I definitely recommend this album to the devotee of serious musical enterprise .
 I 'd agree with the other reviews for this CD . It 's hard enough for a band with this much creativity to break through in Christian circles , but that `` tag '' probably makes it doubly hard to make it outside CCM . And it 's a big fat shame , too . `` Delicate Fade '' is one of those recordings that is still going to sound great 10 years from today . The music is so much more mature than their debut . It 's truly one of the greatest rock recordings I own -LRB- and I have around 2000 CDs -RRB- . If anyone out there wants to hear an album similar and just as good they need to buy Christine Glass ' `` Love and Poverty '' . Marc Byrd from Common Children helped produce the CD and it sounds like the female compliment to `` Delicate Fade '' -LRB- not a big surprise since Glass sang on `` Delicate Fade '' -RRB- . I actually think Glass ' recording is better and that is a HIGH compliment . I will never understand why these 2 recordings were practically ignored . I would pit them both against anything else available .
 If you can find this album , be sure to get it . I have listened , owned , and sold hundreds of albums , and after all of this time , this ranks as one of my favorites . After a decade , it 's still impressive . I do n't want to overstate here , but it 's hard not to
 A couple of the songs on this album have been in my personal top ten list for years . It is simply an outstanding collection .
 got to be one of my all-time favorite cd 's . amazing instrumental pieces fused with rock . i love all the songs on the cd but definitely love stains of time most .
 This may be the best CD ever put together . Every song can be a favorite .
 While most bands falter on their sophomore release , Common Children shines . From the haunting opening strains of a lone cello to the radio-friendly closing remix of Eyes of God , the album delivers one stellar track after another . The songs reveal an addictive glimpse into the mind of Mark Byrd , the band 's lead singer , who matures on this CD to stand among the most skillful of living male lyricists . From anger to anguish , contentment to otherworldly bliss , Delicate Fade offers music to suit any mood . This record is a polished gem among the dross of soundalike alternative rock . Do we want to hear these stories ? Yes .
 This is one of the better albums that I have heard in a while , and they seem destined for very good things in the coming year -LRB- Bound Stems first full length album comes out in June . -RRB- There are seven songs on this album and they are all good , but the highlights are `` Wake Up Ma and Par are gone '' , My Kingdom for a Trundle Bed , '' `` Crimes and Follies '' and `` Risking Life and limb for the Coupon . '' I would recomend this for anyone who likes Modest Mouse or Pavement or any other indie band because Bound Stems are awsome .
 This album is awesome Wake Up is the best song . Go MR. GALLIVAN !
 First off all , Lyrically , these songs are right up there with the best in pop music . Completely unpretentious , unpredictable , romantic , outragous ... In a nutshell , very rich and textured . Great singing . Great sounds , covering a full spectrum from wild -LRB- Suicide Transvestite -RRB- to desperate longing -LRB- My Design Is Not My Own -RRB- . It has been a while since I fell for a band and I can honestly say I am head over heels for Charlus . I cant wait for them to make another record !
 Like Prefuse 73 with balls ; this is the album I wish would have followed `` Vocal Studies ... '' Glitchy but never nerdy , hip-hop enough without posturing , a damn near perfect listen aside from the couple tracks with French rappers but what can you do ? Dude representsMontreal to the fullest .
 These 4 discs were first issued separately in the 1990s on Decca 's L'Oiseau-Lyre label . I 'm not a music critic , but I can tell you that these performances are the Penguin Guide 's top choices for these works . The contents
 I really had no complaints about this set when I bought it on an impulse
 Although , I like quite a bit of Glad 's later material and their vocal skills have never diminished , it was earlier Glad that made an impact on me . Captured in Time represents their best effort in my opinion . Everything worked . The musicianship was first rate , the production very professional , the writing was powerful and every song is saturated with scripture . At first listen , this music is enjoyable just for the music 's sake ; however , repeated listens and attention to the lyrics will reveal substance beyond the aural.I highly recommend this CD while it is still in stock and available . I went many years listening to a worn out cassette but this digital version is so much better.I would also recommend Beyond a Star but it is almost impossible to find as I think it never made it to CD -LRB- if anyone knows otherwise PLEASE let me know -RRB- . Romans is another title that ministers but again , extremely hard to find.Find what early titles you can , listen and Be Ye Glad ! - Rick
 This is one of my favorite Glad albums . Not only is it a great evangelism to non-believers , but it brings a needed reminder to Christians that God is always there for us , even when we have `` Questions '' , or want to `` Hide Myself in You '' . This album also contains Glad 's `` signature '' song , `` Be Ye Glad '' , by Michael Kelly Blanchard , one of my favorites . Musically , the entire album is a masterwork of tight harmony , clean , clear vocals , and wonderful arrangements . Not only do these guys carry a powerful message , but they present it with amazing talent .
 This is what I consider to be one of GLAD 's best band albums . Not only in musicianship but lyrically as well . This album may have been released in 1982 , but the songs are still relevant today . And their listening styles are easy as ever , with light jazz to a 80 's pop feel , they have it all . I have loved listening to this album for so many years , it 's been such a blessing to me . And just to let you know ... if I was stuck on an island with only one GLAD band album to choose , this would be one of my top picks !!!
 I was surprised to learn that this CD was first recorded by Glad in 1982 . The vocal skills of this group have wide appeal because of their timeless musicianship and the message they are conveying . Their style features impeccable harmony and pleasing arrangements which show their love of the Lord in a wonderful way . The mood of the music is upbeat and uplifting and has a message for Christians in any stage of their walk . The songs on the album are not widely known , so they have a fresh appeal and each one is a delightful surprise . This is the first Glad CD I have bought , but it wo n't be the last !
 One of Glad 's early recordings before they became an acappella unit . I did not recognize it at first due to the change in cover artwork -LRB- my old LP had the band in front of an old juke-box but without the green border . Superb songwriting , musicianship and vocal harmonies are what 's in store on this excellent recording of diverse tunes assembled in a attention-holding mix . . The music style blends rock , jazz and pop styles effectively . This disc should be re-issued if it has n't already , but then the CCM record industry seems reluctant to do so with many if not most of the early to mid-era classics . Get it when you find it !
 This CD is exactly what it states on the cover
 Foucault once said to Pierre Boulez that he admired new music for it at least kept pace profoundly with technology and came to powerfully utilize whatever dimensions it had offered the creative person , in concept.Development in electronic sound/timbre was not without its own sets of dead-ends , and paradigms . At one point it was considered `` mausoleum-like '' . Here you sit in an audience row staring at two large box seven-foot rectangles , suggesting nothing live , alive , nothing interactive , nothing leading anywhere , no human form of intervention , but into a frozen expanse , of a reconcocted abstract electronic space , i.e. whatever is projected out of these rectangles to you . Live electronics was certainly a breath of fresh air especially then with ensembles and groups with a better focus on human interaction and social content . Surely AMM of London , MEV in Rome , and Stockhausen 's Group were great examples introducing the improvisitory element as well . There were others , but now we tend to think of improvised music situations as the `` cutting edge '' of this creative trajectory.This two Disk set allows you here to survey Luigi Nono 's contributions to this creative trajectory who also utilized live performers with electronics . Sorry the concept / package here was to limit Nono 's works to only those for `` Solo Tape '' , -LRB- nastro magnettico -RRB- . There are many important works missing I beleive '' Musica Manifesto No. 2 Non consumiano Marx '' , -LRB- 1969 -RRB- , the impressive 40 minute `` A floresta e jovem e cheja de vida '' -LRB- 1966 -RRB- , a dedication to Dallapiccola `` Con Luigi Dallapicccola '' -LRB- 1979 and the powerful `` La Fabbrica Illuminata '' -LRB- -LRB- 1964 -RRB- Nono thought of the electronic genre as incredibly suitable to promuligating Marxism , the cause of the Left . The concert hall venue was increasingly hostile to political content and overall too difficult and bound to exclusively the middle classes.Who could better to afford seats at the opera.It was only with the help of the PCI in Italy that Nono was able to have any of his large-scale works produced , as his opera to activism in women 's history , `` like a burgeoning light of love '' -LRB- 1972/74 -RRB- Obvious as well was this form of radical expression did not sit well within bourgeois venues , concert promotors and corporate funders.Nono at one point was banned from travel to the USA , and refused a visa . So having more complete control over the final product without sacrificing the technology or inflammatory content it may incorporate on a complex level appealed to Nono.Especially since his works were broadcast on the radio for a larger audience . Here he could utilize documentary-like texts , also live or pre-recorded footage from demonstrations for whatever he thought important relative to current events.It was as close as a composer can come to working in film . You can also pre-record singers without the `` inaccuracies '' rendered during a live performance.But then you need to circumvent the `` frozen '' stilted singing that may result , if edited and done with splicing the segments together . You can however finely hone a work as long as you like.The radical content of much of the work here certainly reflects the scale of time portrayed roughly the Sixties , the time of the student movements , Algeria , and Vietnam , the rise of Nasser and the still functioning anti-fascist Left in Europe . There is also a long work after the Nazi Trials in Frankfurt , made into a Play by Peter Weiss , `` Ermittlung '' . Weiss also wrote a situation , position text for this time `` The Aesthetics of Resistance '' , a work that still holds true favor for the political artist if you care to read and follow it . Nono was asked by Weiss to provide electronic sounds for his controversial Play . This largley takened from Nono 's previous work of the same subject matter `` Ricorda cosa ti hanno fatto in Auschwitz -LRB- 1966 -RRB- , `` remember what was done to you in Auschwitz '' . Both are powerful examples of how serious music can perhaps remain the only form to express , to represent how millions came to be were murdered , and for What ? the question of genocide , of various `` ethnic cleansings '' still remains , as it also remains today in the Middle East.The overall effect of the tape sounds here are mural-like , and the timbres sound dated with many different voices occuring simultaneously , with long sustained enveloping sounds , sharply cut , then noise-like `` musicque concrete '' events , shouting , all quite effective and powerful.The anti-war `` Contrappunto dialettico alla mente '' -LRB- 1967-68 -RRB- commissioned for radio broadcast especially has this incredible power of disunity , of fragmentations . It is serious music here with a rich complex pallette of sounds and texts from the Sixties.Nono thought of the medium itself of electronics as subversive , for it came to disrupt the logical projections of instrumental music . His opera `` Intolleranza '' for example , the electronics projected from multiple speakers throught the performing space `` fights '' with the pit orchestra and becomes circumvented where you can not decipher whats going where.There are also very detailed notes and complete texts for all the works here in the accompaning booklet , all translated into English . These texts are seminal , never published -LRB- in English -RRB- takened from the Studio Fonologia -LRB- RAI -RRB- in Milan and the Nono Archive in Venice.Nono then went on , as you may know to requistion all this work , the experiences to a live electronics , that proved ever more developmental in the subsequent utilization of computer systems , storing sounds for released later within a work , antiphonal usage as well , and transformations of instrumental timbres , as his powerful `` Prometeo ''
 I have other albums by Luigi Nono , but this I find the most interesting . The music like it 's creator can be rather enigmatic at times . I think this album has an interesting sense of time and space that still sounds fresh today.The fact that Nono began to incorporate documentary material -LRB- political speeches , slogans , extraneous sounds -RRB- on tape , and a new use of electronics , that he felt necessary to produce the `` concrete situations '' relevant to contemporary political issues -LRB- Annibaldi 1980 -RRB- . The instrumental writing tended to conglomerate the ` punctual ' serial style of the early 1950s into groups , clusters of sounds -- broadstrokes that effectively complimented the use of tape collage -LRB- Annibaldi 1980 -RRB- . I would like to hear a live performance of these works , but I will not hold my breath . `` Omaggio A Emilio Vedova '' is a very interesting slice of sound sheets and `` Contrappunto Dialettico Alla Mente '' has a haunting quality I find intriguing . All in all this is a pretty good collection of Nono 's electronic work from his late 1950 's to 60 's period .
 I stayed away from this one for quite awhile -- first to get used to Current 93 's `` apocalyptic folk '' style -LRB- I considered it a sell-out compared to their excellent early albums -RRB- , then because it is just piano . Finally , I gave it a try , and the first thing I realized is that this man can make his songs work with just piano . `` A Gothic Love Song '' is of course a hit , but there are many other songs that deal so poignantly with loss of a loved one and all manner of ravings about Christ . I ca n't say I am crazy about the piano solo tracks -- wish they 'd tuned the piano and it 's just not so interesting without Tibet . Guitars or no guitars , I would take this one hands down as a very personal and visceral effort over `` Sleep has his house '' -LRB- for example -RRB- any day .
 I really liked this album and still do but as a lot the music has been lifted directly from the ` music box theme ' from the movie ` The Innocents ' I am kind off dissapointed . It has also ruined my viewing of the movie as I just hear Current 93 whenever I watch it :-LRB- .
 I do n't know much about other C93 releases . This was my first , and I really enjoyed it . I do n't know if enjoyed is the most accurate word ... perhaps , it conveyed much emotion and experience that one finds in introspection . This music is not calm or peaceful . There are intense parts . The delivery of the lyrics are organic without much structure , but with a purpose like free verse . The `` spoken '' delivery creates more intimacy like you are talking to yourself . I ca n't listen to this album often , but that is because it is draining and very emotional . Great piece of art . -LRB- Also , the paintings by Tibet are intersting ... -RRB-
 The title of this album , referencing the redoubtable Thomas Ligotti 's ` Teattro Grottesco ' wass enough to interest me . That it was another product of the prolific and diverse Current 93 further whetted my apetite.The pieces here are quieter and more minimal than one might expect , with David Tibet intoning his words to a skeletal Satie-esque piano accompaniment . The words and music meld into a timeless , crystalline beauty . There are too many elements to catalogue here , but in many ways this can be considered an autobiographical album . By the standards of Current 93 it is extremely accessible , and I would hope that more people would take the time to experience and enjoy the subtle beauty.The minimalism of these compositions is significant . Not a word , not a note is wasted . The listener is presented with glittering fragments of life . These soft black stars are our friends , unlike Dr. Groddeck 's .
 Easily one of the top 10 albums I 've ever had the pleasure of coming across . David Late Tibet 's songwriting hits some very personal notes-assuming for him and the listener . As the father of a 2 yr old , Soft Black Stars , in particular , has touched me.As with all Current 93 's work , it is sublime and about much more than the music . A must have .
 many people seem to want another nature unveiled or thunder perfect mind or some other great c93 album repeated . i find that possible only if c93 is superficially understood , so one does n't see the substance of current 's work and that is a specific spiritual life made manifest through expression in the broadest sense of the word . expression can be a hum , a whisper , words , noise , melody , guitar , piano ...
 My Wife , Girlfriend at the Time , introduced me to this Album back in 1998 . I remember she told me that she wanted to show me the most beautiful music that she had heard . When she played it for me I had to agree that it was indeed beautiful , I had never heard anything else like it . Soft Black Stars has never lost that for me , no matter how matter how many times I have listened to it .
 Current 93 continue their transition into neo-classicism / minimalism apace . Herein , Tibet 's songwriting makes an intensely personal shift , reaching an almost confessional tone . The fragile and sombre mood of the album is all encompassing and of equal , if not greater , intensity to their earlier more overtly ` doomy ' works , and Heeman , Tibet and Stapleton 's music is beautifully understated .
 An awful lot of people have a hard time with current 93 's music , and i would think it 's more than just those people that would agree that it is because of david 's voice . I was one of the people who just could n't dig it cause of this guys voice . I really did n't get it untill i heard this album . It made it all make sense . I did a complete 180 . It changed my point of veiw completely about david tibet . I now understand what too few people understand because of soft black stars . And thank you
 There are not too many words to explain the ethereal beauty of this c.d. . You just need to listen once to be hooked on the sounds created by David Tibet and friends . Just buy it and then purchase the accompanying live c.d. . It 's `` A Gothic Love Song '' is a masterpiece in it 's own right .
 Somberly soft tone . A clearer and sparser project than the nevertheless equally listenable SLEEP HAS HIS HOUSE . I can take in Tibet 's vocals before I get around to really listening to the lyrical matter . So that says that the music is immediate and his voice is musical as always . AND A CORRECTION ? -- The liner notes say * David Tibet * did the artwork , not Bunting as the critic 's review here says . I would n't think it 's an alias ...
 It may be true that this album lacks in some of the elements C93 is renowned for . it will not shock or surprize anyone . Still it in a sense epitomizes their music of the 90-ties . Of course , it is subjective , but for me this album wholy reveals the side of C93 I appreciate most - intelligent lyrics , mood , sadness , introspection . Very minimalistic and beautiful.Also - very personal for David Tibet , I guess .

 Julius Katchen was considered one of the world 's best pianists when he died tragically of cancer at the age of 42 in 1969 . This 2-CD Double Decca Import title , Volume 5 of `` The Art of Julius Katchen '' series , easily shows why . CD 1 begins with Katchen performing Tchaikovsky 's 1st Piano Concerto with Piero Gamba conducting the London Symphony Orchestra . Gamba and Katchen also made highly regarded recordings of the Beethoven Piano Concertos , and the Tchaikovsky is equally special . Next is Prokofiev 's 3rd Piano Concerto with Istvan Kertesz and the LSO . The pianist recorded a mono version of this Concerto with Ansermet -LRB- recently reissued on Testament -- see my review -RRB- , but Katchen 's stereo account is even better -- Katchen and Kertesz always made musical magic together . Disc one concludes with Liszt 's Hungarian Fantasia again with Gamba and the LSO . CD 2 is basically a re-tread of `` The Classic Sound '' title available domestically -- Rachmaninov 's 2nd with Solti and the LSO , and the Paganini Rhapsody and Dohnanyi 's `` Variations on a Nursey Theme '' with Boult and the London Philharmonic . As mentioned above , many of Katchen 's vintage performances have been available sporadically stateside , but these Australian imports are without a doubt the best way to currently get all of his glorious Concerto recordings .
 I 've been burnt a number of times when I take a chance on a CD based on one song . Too often the one you heard is the best of the bunch and the rest amount to filler . I heard the title cut from this album on our local Christian radio station and took a chance despite my past experience . I 'm happy to say there 's nice music here.Although the title cut , `` Boomerang '' , has a nice hook and Bruce is at his James Taylor best , there 's a lot more to be discovered on the other numbers.Good tunes and some truly insightful lyrics provide some really refreshing , inspiring Christian moments on this CD.Buy it .
 I ordered this album on whim . I stumbled across the video for `` Closer '' online , and fell in love with the song and the sound of the band . This album is spare and quirky , and yet haunting and beautiful . Overall , the sound is mellow , introspective , and dreamy . I love this album.The instrumentation consists of piano/keyboards , violin , cello , and double base . The lead singer makes interesting use of her voice . She croons . She whispers . Sometimes , she even warbles . Her quirky voice is accompanied by harmony on only one track . Together , these elements combine to create an album unlike anything out there right now.This album is an excellent addition to any music collection .
 This is adorable music , but not in the American sense of the word . It 's a very non-melodic style and extremely abstract as well . What makes it adorable is the way it 's executed , slow , methodical , light , breathy and in the style of Beth Gibbons from Portishead , who in turn was influenced by Billie Holliday and another singer named Shirley who last name I ca n't remember . In addition to the adorable quality of her voice , there is a certain element of darkness that accompanies this music and I think it has something to do with the dissonant style that pops up at times , but I 'm still welcome to this since it 's distinctive to me . As far as what the instruments sound like , just look at the cover and the instruments that they have , it 's that spare . It has a worthy place in my collection and I enjoy it quietly .
 I was not a fan of The Tiny on first listen , but I soon became intrigued and then very into it and now I own the cd . I do n't recommend them to everyone . Music is subjective . At least give it a try though . You might find them fascinating too .
 I found this album only because it was playing in a local record store when i was there . I immediately loved it and purchased it that visit . This album has a very downbeat sound that is mostly instrumental . The lyrics that are included are very fitting and the music never seems to get beyond a pleasant , soft , and medium speed . With mellow and almost hypnotizing rhythms , it is perfect music to listen to in the evening , and mellow enough to sleep to . Apparently there are two good things out of Iceland .
 Blindfold is produced by a couple guys from Sigor Ros , and is the side project of one of the guys from Ampop . It 's good album if you like downbeat ambient atmospheric instrumentals . Very few vocals , very cinematic , very good . Worth the listen .
 This is the best instrumental Christmas cd . The music imparts the very essence of the Spirit of Christmas . I 'm sure you 'll agree once you 've heard it .
 I have finally found Ralph Carmichael 's &#34; Christmas Spirit &#34; in CD . I still have the cassette of it from the 1980 's but I wanted to put it on my IPOD.Each year I would look to see if anyone had consider to put this Beautiful Christmas music on CD and they did this year.Ralph Carmichael 's . &#34; Christmas Spirit &#34; is most enjoyable , I play it on my IPOD in my car on the way to Christmas shopping or just out and about . I enjoy it when at home relaxing with family & friends , or baking and cooking for this Beautiful Holiday ! You will enjoy it as much I do and will smile Merry Christmas !
 of the Moby it have so far this is one of my favorites . i has all the best aspects of Moby 's musical ability
 Techno , house , ambient , dance , electronica , whatever you want to call it , `` Everything is Wrong '' is just great music by a great artist . It has everything a fan of pop music could want .
 `` Everything Is Wrong '' is my personal favorite of Moby 's albums . It has such techno as `` Feeling So Real , '' such minimalist classical as `` God Moving Over the Face of the Waters , '' and many more . It 's one of the CDs that I listen to constantly , and yet do not tire of .
 Well , some people love the play on different styles on this album , while others hate it . I think it works . It prevents the album from becoming monotonous . And it show 's Moby 's open mindedness to variety and experimentation . On tracks 2 , 3 and 7 I can barely stay still , while tracks 1 , 11 , 12 are so relaxing you feel like flying . A very good accomplishment for Moby .
 YOU MUST BUY THIS CD ! This is truly one of man 's greatest achievements . Many genres of music seamlessly blend . The music rocks . It is of all emotions . You will not be disapointed ! Moby rules ! Start here then buy all his other stuff !
 Moby 's `` Everything is Wrong '' features a stunningly diverse mix of musical genres . Listeners seeking an example of the best sounds techno has to offer need look no further than the superb dance tracks on this album , particularly `` Feeling So Real '' and `` Every Time You Touch Me . '' The other songs on the album are also wonderful and bear all the hallmarks of a master at the top of his form . This disc is one of the unrecognized classics of the nineties .
 I did n't like this at first , but now I find it great ! It 's really lighthearted and happy , foreign to what we 're used to seeing on tv and radio . It has harder rock too . It 's a surreal soundscape , a wonderful escape .
 Everything Is Wrong
 Everything is Wrong by Moby may be his most interesting album . It contains the soaring , beautiful rave music in `` Feeling So Real '' , the somber piano melody of `` Hymn '' and the deep , spiritual feel in `` Into the Blue '' . The result is an album that features Moby 's various tastes and talents in different genres of music . I think more of this album as a Moby sampler . A very good sampler . However , it may sound like a `` club '' cd to the mainstream people who recently discovered Moby after he was OVER-EXPOSED by the media and MTV . In my opinion that was a HUGE mistake . Moby is way too talented to cater to the likes of people who listen to N'Sync and Busta Rhymes .
 Alot of techno artists often decry Moby 's lack of innovation or genuine craft , but that was never really Moby 's agenda . Moby built his name on his ambient work , which is frankly some of the moving , inspirational music you will ever hear in pop . Ambient as a form of chamber/soundtrack music , melancholy melodies , Baroque fills , and epic dynamics . Really very beautiful stuff.Using ambient as his foundation , he forms 12 great pop tunes that run the gamut of styles -- house , classical , trance , jungle , punk , hip-hop , and world-beat -- map -LSB- ing an emotionally wild journey into the heart of Moby 's faith . At parts , you 'll be hurled into pits of rage . At others , you 'll be moved to tears . And frequently , you 'll feel a pure ecstatic joy that exceeds most house music.His Christian faith informs almost all of Everything Is Wrong , for in a sense , most of the tracks are really gospel songs , put to his ambient `` orchestra '' , and mixed in with beats . Ear candy and chicken soup for the soul.To judge Moby 's music on purely dance terms is to ignore that Moby is a modern soul man . And this is truly a great soul record in a genre often assumed to have none .
 Long before there was Play , 18 , the Gwen Stefani duets , or videos in spacesuits , there was Everything is Wrong , the album where Moby slid in under the radar and came into his own . It 's an ambitious and groundbreaking album , that goes from piano laced ambient -LRB- `` Hymn '' and the seminal `` God Moving Over the Face of the Waters '' -RRB- to infectious get-on-your-feet techno -LRB- `` Feeling So Real '' -RRB- to trance like investigations into deeper musical channels -LRB- `` First Cool Hive '' and `` Anthem '' , which is a personal favorite -RRB- . Though a bit uneven , this is by far a defining album for Moby , and an extremely worthwhile listen for anyone who enjoyed `` Play '' or `` 18 '' .
 Okay , so a few months after EVERYTHING IS WRONG was released -LRB- a truly superb album -RRB- , I was walking past a music store when I saw a poster on the window advertising this album . I had already fallen in love with the original so I just had to buy it . I have never regretted it since , as it has become one of my all-time favourites.Basically , Moby has compiled a bunch of tracks that are remixes of tracks from the original release . Some are remixes from the singles , some are exclusive to this release -LRB- most are remixed by Moby but you do get some other artists remixing - Westbam and Josh Wink to name but two -RRB- . He then got two turntables and mixed the songs onto two CD 's -LRB- he really did do it that way , on a couple of tracks - if you listen really closely - you can hear the vinyl popping ! -RRB- and the result is this amazing `` mixed and remixed '' album.The 1st CD is the best . Starts off with a very ambient remix of FIRST COOL HIVE , and then neatly slips into FEELING SO REAL -LRB- UNASHAMED ECSTATIC PIANO MIX -RRB- and from there it 's non-stop until the two beautifully mastered remixes of ANTHEM and EVERYTHING IS WRONG . The mixing is amazing , Moby truly is a master at the decks , and this is good proof of that.The 2nd CD does n't really get going for me until the MENACING MIX of HYMN , and from there it 's great . Still , even with the tracks before , it 's a damn good CD . Mixed just as well as CD1.The remixes themselves are mainly superb . Most were available on the singles , such as the FEELING SO REAL mixes and MOVE mixes , but you do get some rare stuff , such as HYMN -LRB- MENACING MIX -RRB- which was only available on the HYMN - REMIXES CD single in Germany -LRB- now long deleted and almost impossible to find -RRB- and ALL THAT I NEED IS TO BE LOVED -LRB- MELODIC MIX -RRB- which was only available on the German 12 '' release of HYMN and Survival 2000 - A Benefit for Survival International which was a various artist double CD album -LRB- both out of print of course -RRB- . And then there are remixes which are only available on this album , such asANTHEM -LRB- CINEMATIC VERSION -RRB- and WHEN IT 'S COLD I 'D LIKE TO DIE -LRB- INSTRUMENTAL VERSION -RRB- . Brilliant tracks , all of them.All in all , this is -LRB- I believe -RRB- Moby 's best release - alongside the original version of EVERYTHING IS WRONG . Do n't get me wrong , PLAY was very good , but for me , EVERYTHING IS WRONG and EVERYTHING IS WRONG
 Shallow teeny-bopper pop ? Excuse me ? Listen to the lyrics of `` Everytime You Touch Me '' - do those seem shallow to you ? Moby has merely realized the truth - everything truly is wrong , but that does n't mean you have to let it put you down . And when Moby genre-bounces , it 's really okay ... he writes good songs no matter what style it is . Another thing ... he writes his own music ! Oooh ! What a breakthrough ! NSync is teenybopper ; Moby is not . This CD is absolutly breathtaking ... has ambient songs , like `` God Moving Over The Face Of The Waters '' , rave/techno -LRB- `` Feeling So Real '' -RRB- and thrash industrial punk -LRB- `` All That I Need Is to Be Loved '' -RRB- . And you should respect the fact that Moby has taken an underground sound and made it accessable to the mainstream - I do n't think your other techno DJ 's would have the talent to be able to do that . Long live Moby .
 Forget what you hear about this album being a mixed bag of empty pop music and failed attempts at bluesy rock . Forget everything about this being more of a sampler than an album . Forget everything about this disc having nothing to say . Remember this is one of the greatest recordings ever.I do n't use those words lightly , and one should n't . All I can say is that no other album as impacted me like this one has . It 's an extremely emotional , desperate , spiritual experience . You may not get it right away , but that 's okay . I suggest your first listen be in the car on a stormy day speeding down the highway . Listen to the whole thing from begining to end , no matter if tracks like `` All That I Need Is To Be Loved '' shock you to the point of pressing the skip button . Then listen to it again . The first time I heard this album I cried for hours . I ca n't decribe what went through my mind ... I 'm not sure I 'd know how to start.If you can , find `` Hymn -LRB- This is My Dream -RRB- '' and `` Hymn.Quiet.Alt Version '' . These are two mind blowing versions of the opening track and perfectly complement the album . One is like a whole different song all together -LRB- almost has a religious feel with a choir in the backround -RRB- . The second is a thirty minute ambient track that must be listened to in it 's entirety with the volume full blast . These two songs reveal how great of an artist Moby is .
 Simply put , one of the best albums in my collection . Find myself listening to it over and over again . Covers many differnet styles and never boring , never dull .
 Moby is infamous for never sticking with a given style , and attemting to write many different kinds of music . This amazing CD features some of Moby 's best songs in every genre that he 's tried , while avoiding the excesses that `` Play '' went to with regard to musical experimentation and eclecticism . `` Feeling So Real , '' `` Bring Back My Happiness , '' and `` Anthem '' are all energetic , fast-paced dance tracks that anyone can enjoy . This album , however , also comes through for the more relaxed , introspective listener . The ambient tracks -LRB- `` Hymn , '' `` God Moving Over the Face of the Waters , '' `` Everything Is Wrong '' -RRB- are top-notch , featuring effective use of the piano and synth together to create hauntingly beautiful songs . Also worthy of note is the wonderful and melancholy `` When It 's Cold I 'd Like to Die , '' featuring vocalist Mimi Goese.Despite a few annoying tracks -LRB- `` All That I Need Is To Be Loved , '' `` Let 's Go Free '' -RRB- , `` Everything Is Wrong '' overall is a great success , highly representative of Moby 's creative , versatile nature as an artist . It is his best album -LRB- better than `` Play '' in my opinion -RRB- , and it has my highest recommendation.-Bill , the Mecha Master
 I love this album , it is my favorite album of all time , and thats all I have to say about it .
 I absolutely love Moby and have for about 5 years , ever since my brother started listening to him . My favorite song is `` Everytime You Touch Me '' because it exerts so much energy and it 's really fun to sing along with . I love all the others and I 've just always that that he has a real talent and feel for what music should be . He never fails to impress me ... except with `` Animal Rights '' but there were still some good songs on that one . If you like Techno you 'll love Moby ... and if you like moby you should also check out `` Sunscreem '' O3 ... well , you know . like the oxygen symbol thingy , only with a three instead of a two . They rule ! just one last thing before I go ... LONG LIVE MOBY !!!
 This is a great cd , relflecting what moby is capable of , and of course where he 's coming from ... Definetly beter that `` Play '' which reeks of `` this is what people want to hear '' and a bit more refined and developped that some of his previous albums , `` Ambient '' comes to mind .
 This is one of my favorite Moby albums ... it 's after his really techno-y days , and before his newer work , so it 's a nice mix of both.I love it !
 Moby 's 1995 contribution to the world is a mixed bag of delights and mystery . `` Hymn '' introduces one to this collection with an almost hyper piano melody on steroids . It certainly fits into the ` hymn ' or a ` song of praise ' category , but feels repetitious despite its pleasant feel . Then the listener is attacked with nasty punk grunge-like selections of songs like , `` Feeling So Real '' , `` All That I Need Is To Be Loved '' and `` What Love '' . To be fair , these are perfectly good punk rockers . `` Let 's Go Free '' and `` Bring Back My Happiness '' are probably the most confusing techno-pop I 've heard in a long time . They seem like experiments rather than songs . And just when you think all is starting to fall away , the listener is treated to mellow melodic trance-inducing mood songs like , `` First Cool Jive '' , `` Into The Blue and the truly original `` God Moving Over The Face Of The Waters '' . While Moby could never be fit into any one specific category other than `` maybe '' techno-pop , his creations are always wildly imaginative . This collection is a keeper simply for so many of its unique creations on so many different levels . Moby also always keeps you guessing , as in the instance of the title track , `` Everything Is Wrong '' which seems so very ordinary , plodding and slow . But then he finishes the album with one of his most beautiful songs ever . `` When It 's Cold I 'd Like To Die '' is an amazing , romantic piece of music with instrumentals that flow through you like calming waves and a vocal that rivals Annie Lennox . This song is alone worth the ownership of this album . Moby can be a genius when he wants to be .
 Moby is probably one of the most influentual dance artist to date , this album however was released before his big breakthrough in America . The music is a little diffrent to what it sounds today , but if you listen to it you can hear that certain songs are simular to what moby is making today . `` Anthem '' reminds me alot of `` Why does my heart ... '' but it 's more of a house song . `` Into the blue '' and `` First cool hive '' are also something for newer Moby fans . There are many slow and beautiful songs on the album like the piano song `` Everything is wrong '' and `` God Moving Over The Face Of The Waters '' . my favorutes are the uptempo techno songs `` Feeling so real '' and `` Everytime you touch me '' those are simply wonderful . A few songs are almost punk-rock , they are very noisy and should be ignored . Moby is in the middle of his progress . A very good album with a great mix of diffrent flavors . Must have .
 I found this in a used record -LRB- I still call them records ... -RRB- store and took a chance on it . It is Moby doing what he does best
 Before Play was released and people found out the existence of electro music 's recent prince , Moby had recorded Everything Is Wrong . This 1995 album includes a beautifull artwork with melancholic photos of the artist swimming underwater -LRB- his face almost looks like a mask on the cover -RRB- . The songs too have somehow the sense of waves in their sound . Ethereal instrumental tracks like '' Hymn '' and '' God Moving Over The Face Of Waters '' are simply angelic while equally atmospheric are '' Into The Blue '' and '' When It 's cold i 'd like to die '' where he cooperates with Hugo Largo 's Mimi Goese . Finally , '' Feeling So Real '' and '' Everytime You Touch Me '' are pure dance perfection . Overall , Everything Is Wrong is so full of energy and ideas that you get the impression this is a prodigy kid 's debut . It 's not though . It 's the second record by the genius vegeterian musician who , besides a great future ahead of him , has a great record past too .
 As much of the music released by moby , This Album is spectacular . Each songs fits well with the next . Sweet beats are well mixed with many different tempos . Specifically , the song everything is wrong is slow paced , but portrays a great deal of emotion throughout it . Overall , Any Moby fan would enjoy this Album .
 While there might me thematic motivations for the periodic instances of the punk/thrash-metal hybrid that occur on Moby 's `` Everything is Wrong '' , it is an unfortunate truth that the songs that exemplify this mode -LRB- ie `` What Love '' -RRB- are not , in and of themselves , well done . Remove those hardcore pistaches , and what we have is a melancholy , classically-influenced collection of some of Moby 's best , most soulful offerings . The album begins -LRB- `` Hymn '' -RRB- and ends -LRB- `` God Moving Over the Face of the Waters '' , `` When it 's Cold I 'd Like to Die '' -RRB- in the gorgeous , blissed-out heaves and sighs of synthesizers ; `` When it 's Cold I 'd Like to Die '' is my nominee for Moby 's best work to date . On the whole worthwhile , but spotty .
 I could not disagree more strongly with the comment that this album is suitable only for club-kids . I think actually this might not be a clubber 's cup of tea . Instead , this is perfect driving , cleaning , dancing around the house music . It can be listened to as background or at high volume
 This CD is pure timeless genius . One of the most significant works of art that was released into the collective consciousness during the 1990 's . A s honest an exposition of love , fear and the beauty of life as one can imagine . Addictive and haunting . Buy it now . Far superior to this year 's overrated , less personal Play . The Beach Boys ' Pet Sounds is referred to as ` music that makes you feel loved ' . ` Everything is Wrong ' continues that legacy .
 OK , so the stuff printed on the CD jacket is pretentious & irritating -- what 's important is the music ... & from whatever inspired Moby , the results are impressive . Although not nearly as catchy or complex as the grooves on ` Play , ' ` Everything Is Wrong ' dives into both joyous up-tempo & slowly etched electronica . If you 're suffering from pre-millennial angst , this is a good choice .
 Excellent ... Superb ... an artist who is n't afraid to access the universe ... Absolutely Amazing ... Ground breaking ... Mature . . Earth shattering ... Not for trendy people.So what are you waiting for?God Bless Moby !
 Before Play and Animal Rights , Everything is Wrong is a bit of a warmup to Moby 's later works . This album , unlike Animal Rights , is pure techno . Songs like `` Hymn '' and `` First Cool Hive '' showcase Moby 's early stages of imaginative electronic music . The 7-minute song `` God Moving over the Face of the Waters '' is my personal favorite on this album
 As always , Moby takes his music to another level , with creative piano pieces , a variety of techno and various voices . Where was Moby during the days I frequented raves ? Luckily , Moby 's music is available to those of us who appreciate genuine art .
 The atonal approach with fluctuating volumes and busy motives underlining the orchestral pulsating in some tracks is what i liked most . If only he had spent a bit more score time on tonal action , I think the album could have been better.Also fat boy slim has great sounds . but something new would be fusing these with some jazz or rock . Just check E.S.T. or Fusio 's album Perfect Circumstances for example.Why not dance to some piano and stings for example?Check this for example : http://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Circumstances/dp/B0047XLQE0/ref=sr_shvl_album_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1290798488&sr;=301-1
 For everyone who was too young at the time for listening him.For everyone who got to know him only by that time when his creations started to belong to up-to-date and soooo cool outfits.For everyone who is wondering what 's this special music that 's coming out of the speakers in Target.For everyone who wants to know how his whole masterwork started.But most importantly
 I can not put this album down . Moby released it in the 90s , but it resonates loudly , even today.Moby 's talent is obvious here.I recommend it highly .
 Everything Is Wrong was mostly a album combined with many different and experimented songs . He goes from melodic piano to hard rock to ambient textures and others . This album sounds more like something similar to ` Animal Rights ' but , Animal Rights was not as great . My personal favorites were his piano tunes -LRB- Hymn , God Moving Over the Face of the Waters , & Everything Is Wrong -RRB- ... I wish he 'd make more tracks like that in his future albums to come . For those who would prefer to stick with his gool ol' dance tunes , listen to the tracks
 Moby , the underground techno icon , put his strongest effort is to everything is Wrong . Hymn starts you with a hint of ambient , almost eclastic beauty . Feeling So Real grabs you after the second or third listen . Moby really streches musically here . Its an odd piece that really grows on you . What Love & First Cool Hive brings us to the forefront of the depth of expresion this man is capable of . He took chances that no other artist of his time would take . With Everything is Wrong , he was finalizing the techno bible so-to-speak . We end with Into the Blue - a fantastic piece that leaves you hanging in his grooves . In 1995 , Moby was awesome but most folks did not see it . Then the off beat strang attempt with Animal Rights , which even now distance himself from . If you REALLY want to know Moby , this record is a must ! Beautiful spin !
 One of the top 10 electronic albums of all time , and probably Moby 's best , Everything is wrong is excellent . It is his most diverse album . Sometimes you fill find yourself groovin to a techno beat -LRB- `` Feeling So Real '' -RRB- and sometimes you will be deeply moved -LRB- `` God Moving Over The Face Of The Waters '' -RRB- . Some electronic artists that try to fuse those stylings do n't pull it off , but Moby does and with style . Buy this album , it 's incredible .
 I must say I was blown away by this collection.It is a Continuous mix frombeginning to end.Disc 1 in my opinionis better because the remixes are simply awesome ! Even one song seems to flow nicely to the next.These remixes sound far superior to the original onesbecause they sound fresher and full oflife.Disc 2 is very good but not as good as the first.The remixes are notas fun and catchy . Actually some arevery repetitive.You will want to use the skip button on some tracks.Otherwise it is an essential buyand listen for all Moby and Techno fans .
 If you are a fan of incredible music , period ... add `` Everything Is Wrong '' to your collection ! Not only is it was of the most inventive and truly moving albums ever put out , it also defies categorization which is a serious accomplishment in today 's pop-driven music world ! Forget the labels ... anyone with a love for life should own this ! LOL
 After purchasing my first Moby album -LRB- Play -RRB- , and attending a fantastic concert , I was n't sure which of the numerous Moby albums to get ! Luckily , I chose this one . This album has two tones . The first -LRB- 1-7 -RRB- songs have faster beats , and are more dance-oriented . The last -LRB- 8-13 -RRB- are slower , much more introspective tracks .1 - `` Hymn '' - A nice opening song , neo-classical , fairly short -LRB- 3 minutes -RRB- .2 - `` Feeling So Real '' - You ca n't help but move to this song ! Sweet synth , catchy vocals , and a great underlying beat . If you like this song , try the Westbam Remix ! 3 - `` All That I Need Is To Be Loved '' - More on the rock side , scratchy guitars and Moby 's classic scream/singing lyrics ! A refreshing change from the rest of the album .4 - `` Let 's Go Free '' - A thirty-seven second `` song . '' I skip this song .5 - `` Everytime You Touch Me '' - A great dance song , with a touch of reggae . The singer has a fantastic voice . `` Everytime ... '' is similar to `` Feeling So Real . `` 6 - `` Bring Back My Happiness '' - Piano , synth , a throbbing beat and -LRB- should I say it again ? -RRB- , fantastic vocals . This is the fastest song on the cd , and a favorite of mine .7 - `` What Love '' - Starts out bluesy , then breaks into a fast rock-genre song . The lyrics are screamed and just great ! 8 - `` First Cool Hive '' - The first song of the `` second set . '' -LRB- The word FIRST is in the title , I wonder if this is coincidental ? -RRB- Hummed vocals , and a feeling almost similar to `` Porcelain '' from Play .9 - `` Into The Blue '' - A female vocalist whom evokes a sense of deja-vu for me . A sweet song , but not one of my favorites . 10 - `` Anthem '' - This track somewhat is a blend of the first and second set . A quick pace , but vocals similar to the slower tracks . Creepy children voices at about the minute and a half mark .11 - `` Everything is Wrong '' - Piano , perfectly framed by synth . An extremely sad song . It has nearly brought me to tears at times . Beautiful , but depressing .12 - `` God Moving Over The Face Of The Waters '' - My personal favorite . Neo-classical , with piano . It truly does remind you of water dropping , or waves cresting and falling . Just try to listen to this , watch the rain out your window and NOT be completely mesmerized ! 13 - `` When It 's Cold , I 'd Like to Die '' - The female singer from `` Into The Blue , '' is on this track also . It 's interesting how both this album and Play both end with a slow song , similar in feel.All in all , this is an absolutely wonderful cd . At first I did n't like the almost abrupt change from the dance songs to the slower tracks . But after listening to `` Everything Is Wrong '' almost non-stop this weekend , I have gained a new respect and appreciation for Moby as not so mucha musician , but an artist . This album is worth it 's weight in gold .
 . . Ok . Get this album and read the liner notes.If this album was just a loop of pop corn popping , what he writes in the liner notes says more than 90 percent of the music out today.The fact that this album contains some of the best techno and neo-classical music you will ever hear is musical equivelant of winning the lottery and Publishers Clearing House Sweepstakes in the same day . That Moby , he 's got brains and beats!If you like classical music but want something more 1990 's rather than 1890 's heres your chance . If you love the beety-beat-beat of techno but wished the DJs had more of a voice and said something worth while , heres your chance . If you like PLAY by Moby and want to learn more about his sound HERE IS YOUR CHANCE!If someone were burning all the records in the world and I could only save 10 , this would be one of the 10 I would choose to save.ITS THAT GOOD !
 Everything Is Wrong which was Moby 's 6th CD -LRB- counting the EP , Move -RRB- is a very important album in his career . It helped establish the fact that he 's a very eclectic artist . Before Everything Is Wrong , Moby was primarily known as a techno artist , and a pretty good one at that . However , on this album , he gives the listener a variety of different styles
 Everything is right with this album . This must be Moby 's most eclectic and hence most innovative release , coming as it did in 1995 , a year still dominated by alternative music in the post-Cobain era.There 's the standard techno `` Feeling So Real , '' `` Everytime You Touch Me , '' and `` Bring Back My Happiness . '' and `` Anthem . '' The last two have more BPM 's . After the opening synthesizers of the latter , get ready to jack your body into rave overdrive ! `` Anthem '' would definitely fit in a car mix-tape , but be careful not to get too carried away with it , because when BPM begins to equal MPH , a B&W will give you a speeding ticket.There are simple piano compositions like the opener , `` Hymn , '' and the title track . `` What Love '' , with Moby 's distorted and monstrous vocals , contains an industrial NIN sound . It 's like Pearl Jam 's `` Spin The Black Circle '' being given a Trent Reznor remix job . This is the hardest track on the album . `` First Cool Hive '' and `` Into The Blue '' fall into Enigma-style ambient.The last two songs constitute another glass from the bottle of pleasant melancholy I constantly drink from . `` God Moving Over The Face Of The Waters '' is a 7:20 orchestral instrumental with piano . The rhythm keeps repeating , along with a single pound of a bass drum , with a cymbal crash added later , slowly gaining in volume until it reaches a majestic crescendo before sinking back down in volume . Part of this song is played at the end of Heat , after Robert de Niro dies . `` When It 's Cold I 'd Like To Die '' is a nominee for a song I 'd like to here as I 'm drawing my last breath . The mental image I form in my head is myself floating down the Thames . London 's bright lights are the candles at my vigil , and as the song fades , I slowly sail down the river 's mouth and into the ocean . It 's a lovely song of . I do n't want to swim the ocean/I do n't want to fight the tide/I do n't want to swim forever/When it 's cold I 'd like to die '' . Mimi Goese 's forlorn vocals give it a blissfully heavenly ambience.The essays included in the album sleeve demonstrate how thoughtful , intelligent , and conscientious Moby is . He promotes a vegetarian diet , priority in caring for the environment , tolerance of race , creed , and individual beliefs , and decries the agenda of the Christian right . And if the list of facts he 's collected in the sleeve does n't stir you , you must be six feet underground . Yes , everything is wrong , including not listening to this eclectic masterpiece .
 While I can see where the reviews are coming from -LRB- e.g. , that the music is unoriginal , the message not coming through -RRB- , after repeated listening , I suddenly got it . The beginning half , while a bit `` poppish , '' gives me the eerie image of someone frantic , eyes wild , trying to distract himself from the all-too-real knowledge that `` Everything is Wrong . '' Sure , it seems like simple dance music on the surface , but there 's a desperation underlying the album , from the frantic first half to the dread and acquiescence of the second half . The music , do n't get me wrong , is great ; but taken as a whole , it 's so much more powerful that you just want to cry at the despair he conveys . Do n't just judge on first impressions , folks ; it takes a while , but once you get it , you 'll know what I mean , and why I gave this piece of art five stars .
 this album is just so beautiful , very grandiose . it gives you the feeling of flying over the arctic and looking at the blue water and the icebergs . the loneliness you feel , the coldness , and the warmth that you have in knowing that you have something as grand as this record to comfort you . it 's also worth it to read his comments about life and philosophy on the record sleeve . if it hits you in some way good or bad then it was worth it .
 I have no problem with Moby 's social , religious , and political opinions , but there is something really missing on this work-of-genius CD . But maybe that 's exactly what Moby is trying to communicate -- the emptiness of modern technical virtuosity . While it has its thrilling moments , and while its simple but beautiful melodies and lyrics linger in my head , ultimately the CD leaves a somewhat depressing mental residue . Whether that is the message -LRB- like , beware , wake up ! -RRB- or whether the missing element is that Moby does n't have a warm , human response to the vacuum he identifies , I do n't know . His message seems rather extreme -- but maybe it has to be to convey his point .
 I originally gave this album a five-star review , but I have changed my mind . The reason I am changing the review is because of two songs
 well , the year is 2006 , and the album `` Everything is Wrong '' came out in ' 95 . How sad -LRB- but absolutely amazing -RRB- it took me THIS long to actually discover this album and give it a chance.Putting all the wonderful songs aside , I would like to mention one song on this album that is absolutely incredibly breath-taking . Its not even breath-taking , you ca n't even breath to lose your own breath ! `` When It 's Cold I 'd Like To Die `` This piece is just brilliant . I 've listened to it non-stop today and probably tomorrow and the next day . Being an artist/actor - I have written a performance art piece to the minute I heard and in hopes of performing it and getting it out there . Its just gorgeous and I do n't even think my words can explain it . I come across many songs as so , but I never ever expected this of Moby -LRB- not a bad thing -RRB- but like everyone else here , I think I can speak for everyone else here , that this really displays Moby as an artist , and an amazing one.The ending of the song is perfect , as if the song is just a moment in time , an epiphany , and at the end - it just ALL fades away in an echo . Its as if the song will continue in its next life.If my piece ever gets performed , i 'll be glad to share it with all the fans .
 `` HYMN '' , AND `` GOD MOVING OVER THE FACE OF THE WATERS '' ALONE MAKE THIS ALBUM AN ESSENTIAL PART OF ANY ELECTRONIC / AMBIENT MUSIC FAN ... BOTH ARE TIMELESS PIECES OF BRILLIANCE , LIFE-AFFIRMING MELANCHOLIC EMOTION THRUST UPON THE LISTENER LEAVING YOU IN A TRANCE OF DEEP THOUGHTS AND CONTEMPLATION ... THE UPTEMPO TRACKS ARE DATED BY TODAYS STANDARDS OF SYNTH MANIPULATION AND SOUND COUNSTRUCTION , BUT THEN AGAIN , THE BEAUTY OF ITS AMBIENT AND DOWNTEMPO MOMENTS ARE WHAT YOU ARE REALLY BUYING THIS ALBUM FOR ANYWAY ... A MUST-HAVE ...
 I really enjoy this album , and really jive with the very well-thought out liner notes . I like more of the songs of `` Play '' , but this is still a must-have for Moby fans .
 I only recently got into Moby.He really is awesome.So original and melodic .
 This is possibly the best CD that I have ever Listened to . After listening to it I became an instant Moby fan . The CD has a great variety of music , all of which are good . I have over 250 CD 's ranging from Iron Butterfly to EPMD to The Lenny Kravitz , and this satisfies all of my needs . I listen to it 1/3 of the time I listen to music . Buy it , and you will never regret it .
 I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM BACK IN 1995 AFTER LISTENING TO ONE OF THE TRACKS AT LA BOOM IN CANCUN , MEXICO . IT IS WITHOUT A DOUBT AN ASTOUNDING ALBUM . I COULD NEVER GET SICK OF IT . THE DAY THAT I DIE I 'LL TAKE THIS TO THE GRAVE .
 moby is the true master of his genre , whatever it happens to be at that moment . in a world of ` artists ' with teams of workers around them -LRB- engineers , writers , producers , musicians , etc. -RRB- helping create ` their sound ' , moby sits at home all alone and creates records by himself , top to botton , start to finish . if you love everything is wrong , i think you would also love ` jane jensen , comic book whore ' alot !
 `` Everyting is Wrong '' is the album of the 90 's . Moby has grasped what is needed to create a wonderfull album . People do n't understand that Moby is a genius , his music has no catagory -LRB- do n't belive me ? check out his album , `` Animal Rights '' -RRB- . Moby can create dance beats and classical all on one album . Solid .
 Moby somehow manages to throw in a little bit of everything into a magnificently unified CD . Whatever he tries his hand at seems to sparkle . The CD had some of the most energetic and some of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard . It is obvious that his music is a labour of love .
 I think that this could be Mobys best album . The best part about the album is the way rock is used . Mobys PLAY > dose not have song that I would call rock . ALL THAT I NEED IS TO BE LOVED is a good song but I think that WHAT LOVE is a much more enjoyble song . I think that FIRST COOL HIVE is a great song . I have heard it in TV adds and it is in the movie SCREAM , it has a short clip of sound when the movie ends just for a few sec . Moby music has been in many movies like DOBBLE TAP , TOMORROW NEVER DIES , COOL WORLD , and JOE 'S APARTMENT and just about every outher TV add it see ...
 I consider Moby one of the best techno artists around to date . I find his music so soothing to listen to -LRB- except for that horrid `` Animal Rights '' cd -RRB- . I did n't get into Moby until his breakout smash `` Play '' thanks to a former roommate who played that cd constantly . That was back in '99 and before `` Play '' was all over television and movies . After falling in love with `` Play '' , I eventually bought Moby 's underground classic `` Everything is Wrong '' . Although `` Everything is Wrong '' is n't nearly as flawless as `` Play '' or `` 18 '' , it is still an excellent Moby album . I was n't -LRB- and still is n't -RRB- wild about the guitar-oriented tracks `` All That I need is to be Loved '' and `` What Love '' . I just did n't think those songs flowed well on a mostly ambient cd . I was n't crazy about the hip hop influenced track `` Let 's Go Free '' either . Thankfully it was only 37 seconds long . I thought those two songs were the weakest tracks on `` Everything is Wrong '' . Songs that I did enjoy was the opening track `` Hymn '' with its gorgeous piano melodies . The same with the epic `` God Moving Over the Face of the Waters '' and the stunning gospel-influenced `` When It 's Cold I 'd Like to Die '' . Although flawed , `` Everything is Wrong '' is a beautiful piece of work that Moby produced and an excellent introduction to his greatness as an artist .
 Too many good songs on this disc to pass up . The perfect album for work , at home , in the car -LRB- though I defy you not to dance in your seat when the vocalist belts out , `` I 'm - Feeling so Real ! '' -RRB- If you remember the 90 's you have to get this one . Not to mention , it has some beautiful uplifting but sad songs , and at least one strangely dropped in punk number .
 Anthology was my introduction to 90 's Asia , and it won me over just by sheer value for what I got . Think about it ... it has every Asia album -LRB- up to ' 97 -RRB- sampled with a few songs each , plus two new cuts . What 's not to like?As others have mentioned , you do get re-recordings of 80 's Asia classics -LRB- `` Heat of the Moment '' , `` Only Time Will Tell '' , `` Do n't Cry '' , `` The Heat Goes On '' , `` Go '' -RRB- , and while some bits of them are good , I still prefer the original recordings . I must say , though , Payne does a superb job with `` Go '' . `` The Hunter '' is good , but again , I prefer GTR 's original . The Asia version is just different . The other new track , `` Different Worlds '' is fantastic ... one of Asia 's most haunting and passionate songs , with fantastic lyrics.The only missteps really are the lack of more tracks from the Arena album , a few typos , and a mis-printed track time for `` Aqua Part I '' , which , by the way , is an edit . -LRB- The original had the sounds of rain and thunder at the end . -RRB- The CD booklet has small concert photos , and lyrics to all songs.Musically , the 90 's were probably Asia 's mostly honestly `` progressive '' period . They started a little shaky on Aqua -LRB- 1992 -RRB- , sort 've bridging from their 80 's to 90 's sound -LRB- thankfully all of the best songs from Aqua are here on this disc -RRB- , then moving to the more polished , operatic and hard-edged Aria -LRB- 1994 -RRB- , and then doing a total 180-degree turn with Arena -LRB- 1996 -RRB- , which was full of smooth 70 's - style classic rock harmonies , Latin and Middle-Eastern rhythms , and dark 8-9 minute prog-metal mini-epics . If you 're curious about 90 's Asia , pick this up . If you 're new to Asia period and are on a budget , get this and Geffen 's Heat of the Moment
 Overall , this album is an excellent introduction to the Asia of the 90 's for those who have only heard their 80 's music . The re-make of the old GTR song `` The Hunter '' and the new `` Different Worlds '' track are also excellent , and almost worth the purchase price themselves . The other 90 's songs on this album are a good sample of the best tracks from Aqua -LRB- 1992 -RRB- , Aria -LRB- 1994 -RRB- , and Arena -LRB- 1996 -RRB- , although I wish that `` Lay Down Your Arms '' from Aqua had made it on here . Oh well , ca n't have everything I guess ... What mars this otherwise excellent album are the re-makes of the 80 's hits `` Heat of the Moment '' , `` Only Time Will Tell '' , `` Do n't Cry '' , `` The Heat Goes On '' , and `` Go '' . I do n't blame John Payne for this , I think he is a fine singer , at least the equal of John Wetton certainly . What messes these songs up is the engineering of them . `` Do n't Cry '' sounds like it was recorded down in a well , and the other songs do n't fare much better . The best sounding ones of the group are `` Only Time Will Tell '' and `` The Heat Goes On '' . These sound pretty decent , if still not as good as the versions on Asia and Alpha . I understand that there were a few pressings of this album that made it out onto the shelves before John Wetton got his court order stopping Asia from using the original versions of these songs on the album , which was their original plan . I would LOVE to get ahold of one of those !
 This is an awesome disc . This has to be the greatest band in the world .
 Asia has released a greatest hits cd that covers from their first cd to their latest . The songs fom their first three cds ASIA -LRB- 5 stars -RRB- , ALPHA -LRB- 4 -RRB- , and ASTRA -LRB- 2 1/2 -RRB- , have been excellently rerecorded , as well as the song `` The Hunter '' from GTR 's only studio cd GTR -LRB- 31/2 -RRB- . Lead vocalist Payne does a great job , on his songs and Wetton 's . Payne 's songs are of course taken from AQUA -LRB- 4 -RRB- , ARIA -LRB- 3 1/2 -RRB- and ARENA -LRB- 2 -RRB- . You can see how the group has changed over the years , gone is the over productuion of the past , and over the top playing , now it 's simple good rock-n-roll . Check it out , a good place to start , to check out the old and new Asia . Only grip , not long enough , some great songs from both eras of the group have been left off . AQUA suffers from the omission .
 This is a great compilation . John Payne is a passionate vocalist , and if you are n't already familiar with the original versions of the five remade 80s songs included here you will have no cause for complaint . I 'm certainly glad that they chose to include a new version of the rocking `` The Heat Goes On '' rather than the limp top 40 ballad `` The Smile Has Left Your Eyes '' . Two previously unavailable but superb tracks open and close the disc , the rest being made up of a very good selection of cuts from the 3 90s albums . Unfortunately their best album `` Arena '' is only represented by two tracks , but to get the best of the Payne era you really need that album in tandem with this collection anyway.As far as I 'm concerned , the 80s and 90s versions of the band were almost completely different and to compare them is akin to comparing apples and apparel . Suffice to say that the 90s version , after a limp start blossomed into a tight unit making excellent music , much of which can be found here .
 I 've been an Asia fan from the get go . This album is a must have for any fan of Asia ! The new tracks just for this album -LRB- `` The Hunter '' & `` Different World '' -RRB- are great tracks and show the continual growth of the band led by Downes & Payne . The true highlights for me are the John Payne versions of 80 's era Asia ! The best of that being `` Go '' & `` The Heat Goes On '' . Wetton is gone and Asia still goes on just fine . So , enjoy this album and check out asiaworld.org for the latest Asia news !
 Ok , so the ' 80 's hits are re-recorded . Thanks to original vocalist John Wetton , Asia had no choice . Because Wetton , Howe , Palmer , Thrall etc. chose to not continue with Asia does not make the band invalid . Even a cursory listen to the cuts that originally sprang from the John Payne era should reveal an extremely talented band moving prog rock forward . Geoff Downes is constantly proving his genius , and John Payne may very well be the most continually underrated singer/songwriter/musician in rock music . If you put `` Anthology '' on , you will have a marvelous time . The re-recordings are not bad at all either ; some are as good as the originals . I 'd advise anyone to start with `` Anthology '' , as to date it 's the only set to include Asia 's greatest from all era 's .
 I do n't understand how so many people find fault with this cd . I own over 2,000 cd 's and this is one of my favorites . Asia is a great band , and these are some of their greatest songs so what gives ? Anyway , if you like adult rock , you 'll love ANTHOLOGY .
 I say that because , unlike `` Then And Now '' , `` Archives '' , `` Axioms '' and the recent best-of , this one encompasses the band 's entire career to date in the song selection . There is no cross licensing , so the 1980 's songs have been re-recorded by the contemporary Asia -LRB- founding member Geoff Downes , ex - Yes keyboardist-songwriter ; and John Payne , since 1992 the bassist-lead singer-songwriter-guitarist , formerly of ELO -RRB- . When `` Anthology '' was first issued in Japan , the original recordings of the Wetton period songs were included ; original frontman John Wetton sued Asia successfully , and those tracks were removed from all future pressings in Japan and were never issued with `` Anthology '' anywhere else in the world . So it 's held back somewhat by this , but the new version of ` Go ' is actually better than the `` Astra '' version , and the others are excellent . `` Anthology '' is criticised by some other reviewers because of John Payne , but there has not been one specific criticism on this board of any of the Payne-era classics on this disc though . Obviously , it 's because they are great songs and amazing recordings . Asia has developed from a band of superstar great musicians involved in a temporary coalition to a living , breathing , ongoing entity of musical innovation . Asia has not been afraid to attempt different things in it 's more recent days , and has yet to fail . There 's the smart prog-rock of `` Aqua '' represented , the philsophical prog-metal of `` Aria '' is here -LRB- including the great track ` Reality ' found on the import and reissue versions of `` Aria '' -RRB- and the madly adventurous `` Arena '' is sampled too . There 's also two new '97 tracks , both of which serve as Asia classics among the fans , killer cuts . With the new versions of the old hits , `` Anthology '' thus presents Asia in it 's most logical and satisfying -LRB- and yes , definitive -RRB- compilation . If it dwells more on the John Payne material than the Wetton material , it is for the better and it only makes sense . The ' 90 's Asia is much more interesting musically , and they are continuing to release new music . I do n't care what anyone says , John Payne is incredible . Geoff Downes knew what he was doing when he took up the musical partnership . I have turned a lot of people who had either never heard of or had forgotten about Asia onto the band by playing them this cd . The ' 80 's hit songs are positioned brilliantly in the programming ; one appears exactly when they need to to sustain the interest of casual listeners . Longtime Asia fans will love this cd too . It 's fascinating to hear John Payne re-interpret the classic rock FM staples , and everything else is magnificent . And for Asia 's more serious fans , there are 7 tracks on `` Anthology '' that remain unavailable on any other release . Thats why it 's the absolutely essential Asia cd for everyone to have who 's even remotely interested in Asia or progressive rock in general . `` Anthology '' is a great , great cd ; it has something for everyone , but some people will just not listen . Do n't make that mistake .
 Some of the songs were re-made , not as good as the originals , but not bad in their own right . Still though , the overall feel of this album is pleasant . I ca n't say its the best Asia has ever released , but there is a new song `` A Different World '' which is one the best songs they have written in awhile . It was interesting to hear John Payne sing on some of the originals , not as effective as Wetton , but still entertaining . Nonetheless , this Asia release is relatively comprehensive , highlighten the better songs of the newer Asia and bringing back memories from the former Asia .
 I love Asia . And this is the one Asia cd that everyone must own .
 Wolf 's last album is an astonishing display of pure guts and deep , deep blues . Tracks like `` Coon On The Moon '' and `` Watergate Blues '' updated the form itself , and he re-invents the past in songs like `` Moving '' , `` Trying To Forget You '' , and the utterly amazing `` Ca n't Stay Here '' . Some so-called purists were put out by the keyboard-simulated harpsichord on a few cuts , but it only adds to the effect of killer tunes like `` Speak Now Woman '' . The great Hubert Sumlin is here as well , and if you 're a guitar player , clean your ears and listen up . While many people point out `` The London Howlin ' Wolf Sessions '' as the highlight of Wolf 's last years , this album is an even deeper , purer document of maybe the greatest of them all . He 's been gone twenty-two years , but I do n't think that voice will ever be entirely dead .
 On this 1973 effort you can hear some guy feeding Howlin ' Wolf his lyrics on the opening cut `` Moving . '' Wolf also flubs a line in the song . We must thank the guardians of blues authenticity for leaving in mistakes and off-mike cues . Nonetheless , this is a fine blues album and Howlin ' Wolf is everybody 's favorite artist . Bluesniks all over Sweden , London and El Cerrito still debate whether Hubert Sumlin or Buddy Guy played the classic guitar licks on Wolf 's '50s and '60s Chess records . On this one Sumlin is credited so I guess it 's him . Someone got Detroit Jr. a harpsichord to play on this album . Another example of that restless experimentation that characterized the Chess label . Howlin ' Wolf was a master of throwaway phrasing just like Frank Sinatra but I do n't believe Mr. Burnett ever got to hang out with any presidents , and if there was ever any chance of that happening his `` Watergate Blues '' queered that deal . But Wolf is easily as good as Sinatra or anybody else , he takes a back seat to no one , and in the ongoing debate over whether Francis Albert or Howlin ' Wolf was better , I say Wolf . This was Howlin ' Wolf 's last album before dying in 1976 . If you do n't know his music , get the early stuff he cut in the Memphis area in the early 1950s , as it remains perhaps his best work . I can hear that guy off-mike right now , feeding Wolf the words , and if I could find out who it was , I 'd write a letter to someone who cared .
 I enjoy listening to the music on this CD very much . This is the last album recorded by the legendary blues giant Chester Burnett , better known as Howlin ' Wolf . The CD notes provide a brief history of the man , the myth , the mighty , moanin ' Wolf . I learned from them that , although he had been performing since the 1930s , he started his recording career at the age of 40 in 1951 . It was in Memphis where he was discovered by Sam Phillips , as in Elvis . His first recording session resulted in a hit , `` MOANIN ' AT MIDNIGHT '' , a personal favourite , and landed him a contract with Leonard Chess . For twenty years begining in 1953 , the Wolf made records with Chess . Although , success was late in arriving for him in the US , if you were at the Crawdaddy Club in London in the 1960 's , you would have known who he was . He was one of the influences for the under-rated British group the YARDBIRDS which was a revolving door for legendary guitarists , Eric Clapton , Jeff Beck and finally , Jimmy Page . In the songs of this CD , Howlin ' Wolf and Hubert Sumlin , who was his guitarist since 1954 , look back over their recording career update and summarize it . As much as this is a Howlin ' Wolf album , it is also a Hubert Sumlin album . If you are learning to play guitar and have yet to master one of Sumlin 's leads , this is a good CD to listen closely to . He balances Wolf 's low growl with treble notes which bend , slide , jab and smoothly grace a pentatonic scale . Sumlin 's style depends on a solid rhythm section to keep things steady , and he is working with a fine one here . CA N'T STAY HERE , SPEAK NOW WOMAN -LRB- ALT . -RRB- and TRYING TO FORGET YOU are standouts as Sumlin showpieces . The last one is a retrospective tour through Wolf 's songs as that woman who is still `` trying to wreck '' his life has him `` moanin ' at midnight '' . If you are interested in the Chicago Blues , or would like to learn the classic guitar solos of Hubert Sumlin , this CD will be interesting to you
 Frankly , this album gets off to a less-than-good start , wherein a really good song -LRB- `` Movin ' '' -RRB- is effectively ruined by the highly audible presence of Eddie Shaw feeding Wolf his lines . This was standard practice for Wolf in the studio , as reading was n't his strong suit , but when it winds up on mic it 's distracting as hell , as it is here.Fortunately , this technical gaffe is not repeated , and the album picks up steam from there with a series of uniformly strong compositions from Wolf and/or Shaw . Wolf is in good voice despite his failing health and puts the songs over well , while Hubert Sumlin turns in some of the most indescribably sublime guitar work of his -LRB- or anyone else 's -RRB- career , which is saying a whole lot.Then there 's the harpsichord . I do n't pretend to know what the motivation was behind this experiment , but it does n't work on any level . The several songs on which it appears are rendered -LRB- to my ears at least -RRB- pretty much unlistenable . It 's too bad , because without the harpsichord , this would be an absolute five star career-closing triumph for one of the giants of American music in the 20th century . However , despite the harpsichord experiment gone awry , there 's still plenty of stuff to like here . If you already own Wolf 's extraordinary Chess albums of the '50s and '60s and are looking for more , The Back Door Wolf will certainly not disappoint .
 This is the last album The Wolf recorded . It has some top-notch songs on it , and a couple of not-so top-notch -LRB- the electric harpsichord is overdone ! -RRB- For any Wolf fan , this is a must . Even after a heart attack or two and kidneys that no longer functioned , Wolf showed on this album that he could still howl like no one else.Recommended
 Finished in August , 1973 , `` The Back Door Wolf '' comprises Howlin ' Wolf 's very last recordings for MCA/Chess . His last recordings for anybody , actually , since Wolf was a very sick man at the time , and he passed away less than 2 1/2 years later at the age of 65 . But it is by no means the last , barely audible gasp of a dying legend . Even at 63 , plagued by kidney failure and serious heart problems , Wolf could rock the house , and this album , while not quite the equal of his output during the 50s and early 60s , is more than worth a listen.It opens with the tough , pulsating `` Killing Floor '' - like `` Moving '' , an autobiographical song penned by Wolf himself , and containing references to many of his old hits , and ends on a high note as well , with bassist Andrew McMahon 's swaggering shuffle `` Ca n't Stay Here '' . Other highlights include the piano-driven `` Stop Using Me '' , the swinging `` Leave Here Walkin ' '' , and Wolf Gang saxist and bandleader Eddie Shaw 's wonderful `` Coon On The Moon '' , an easy , loping blues tune set to Shaw 's proud lyrics about the misfortunes and triumphs of the blacks of America , and delivered with power , dignity and conviction by the Wolf : `` You know they call us coons / Say we do n't have no sense / You know you gon na wake up one morning / And the old coon gon ' be the president - things have changed ! `` The band , anchored by drummer S.P. Leary , is great as always , although I could easily have done without Detroit Junior 's harpsichord which pops up here and there . But guitarists Hubert Sumlin and Willie Harris are excellent , with Sumlin getting off some fiery solos , and Wolf 's harmonica playing is sparse but just right as always.Not the place to start your Howlin ' Wolf collection , perhaps , but a great place to end up.Highly recommended .
 A more detailed review will be on the eventual way but for now ... I feel I must get in my two cents ... This album is EXCELLENT , that keyboard that everyone keeps complaining about rips like Herbie Hancock ! The vocals are at their most developed , the lyrics are at their best , and even speak out and take a stance on songs like `` Watergate Blues . '' Some EXCELLENT all-around muscianship . The title track is a ripping instrumental with the Wolf OOOing over the fine solos.Put this along with the highlight tracks off of `` Real Folk Blues '' and maybe a couple other albums and you have yourself a fine Wolf collection ... One love
 For the critics who think they 're `` purists '' at heart , And complain that the harpsichord `` bites '' , You 're deceiving the masses about Wolf 's GREAT last album , May ` Ol Howlin ' haunt you at night !!! -LRB- With apologies to Maria Ouspenskaya ... -RRB-
 This is an often overlooked and underrated album by Howlin ' Wolf . This was his last album and he is actually in good voice and plays some great harmonica . What I like about this album is the content . Newer songs like ` Coon on the Moon ' and ` Watergates Blues ' stand out for me . It 's not just a rehash of his hits . A major issue with the album is the harpsichord , which can be found on a number of tracks . Too much of this happended in the early 70 's and it really dates the album . This would not be the first place I start to discover the great Howlin ' Wolf , but would be a nice addition to round out a collection .
 On August 2 , 1969 , at the Ann Arbor Blues Festival , in an interview with Michael Erlewine , Howlin ' Wolf said the following in reference to his new song `` Coon on the Moon '' : `` Some of them said years ago , ` We will never make it to the moon . ' I said
 This is the best CD ever . The songs are amazing and the lyrics are beautiful . This CD really made me feel closer to God . I first heard this band at an international gathering of United Methodist Youth seminar , they were singing near the pool . at that instant i knew that i needed to buy the CD . Any one thinking of buying this , dont hesitate .
 I love this CD ! I listen to alot of music , DCtalk , NewsBoys , Etc ; and this by FAR is better than those groups ! If you do n't buy this CD , you 're fooling yourself !
 I also first learned about them at the Methodist youth gathering and feel in love with their music after hearing them play once . The cd is awesome , especially track 12 . Track 3 is the most heart-wrentchins song I have ever heard .
 When I was in middle school I bought this album and loved it . Years later I had lost it after moving to a new home . I spent months looking for one in stores and online . Finally someone listed it here on Amazon and I finally got a new copy . The music is well produced , very gentle music . I love the more allegorical style of story telling in this album . I highly recommend this for Christians or those seeking to know who God really is .
 I really love this CD . The songs will not only get you through the week but the month and year . Vickie is really encouraging the songs give hope and joy . This is a must have for everyone .
 This album is just wonderful . This is because the album sort of reminds us that , `` We Shall Behold Him '' , The Lord Is `` Sweeter Than The Honeycomb '' , and We 've Got The `` Victory '' . Vickie also recorded two new songs , `` That 's All There Is '' , and `` Make Me Over '' . It does n't matter if you have her debut album , and her second album . Buy this album because the Lord will make you over . I love you , Vickie !
 Praise The Lord!Vickie , this cd always take me back when I lived in Pontiac Michigan and all of us would go skating on Thursday nights in Detroit . The DJ would play this cd and it would bring such a pieceful and calm atmospher in there . The clark sisters would be there witness , commissioned some of the winans including angie and debbie , your sons and many other artist . We would all get on the floor and skate to your music . All the songs on the cd would be playing and I was loving every minute of it especially when they played SWEETER THAN A HONEYCOMB AND STAY WITH ME.These songs not only encouraged me they also gave me good memories to last for the rest of my life . I still listen to them this day.Good Gospel music for the soul that has been anointed by the Lord never grows old that includes yours vickie . love you alwaysBe Blessed !

 I am not sure Andr&aacute;s Schiff ever matched the freshness , the directness of his approach in this recording . I happen to believe that Andr&aacute;s Schiff is by far , since his Decca traversal , the best Bach pianist -LRB- and obviously one of the best in everything he touches -RRB- . If I were to grade this CD , I would give it a 100 , 99 for his Decca Bach recordings -LRB- but 95 for the works on this CD -RRB- and also 95 for his ECM recordings .
 Very funny . A must buy . Buy both . If you were ever a hunter , fisherman or Blatz , Pabst , or Old Style drinker , or cheezehead or know one you have got to hear this !
 Double Barrel is the funniest CD I have heard in a long time ! Each time I listen to the songs , I hear different things that I missed the first times and laugh even more . If you like parody songs or are a fisherman or hunter , you have to have Shad-Rapp ! Another CD they have is Shoot ! Der It Is ! -LRB- It 's just as funny -RRB- .
 I 've been burnt a number of times when I take a chance on a CD based on one song . Too often the one you heard is the best of the bunch and the rest amount to filler . I heard the title cut from this album on our local Christian radio station and took a chance despite my past experience . I 'm happy to say there 's nice music here.Although the title cut , `` Boomerang '' , has a nice hook and Bruce is at his James Taylor best , there 's a lot more to be discovered on the other numbers.Good tunes and some truly insightful lyrics provide some really refreshing , inspiring Christian moments on this CD.Buy it .
 Buy this CD if you love & appreciate classic vocal jazz . I first heard Sarah Vaughan on an older `` various artists '' album , later went on to prurchase `` Billie , Ella , Lena , Sarah '' , and then wanted MORE Sarah . This is a two CD set that delivers . Sarah 's voice is awesome , and I was delighted to hear the variations her style lends to classics -LRB- i.e. , Cheek to Cheek -RRB- that I have heard done by other greats like Ella . This CD does n't have the detailed and fascinating liner notes the like those that come with the CD -LRB- Highly Recommended -RRB- `` Billie , Ella , Lena , Sarah '' , but you get two CD 's for a total 31 tracks of brilliant , soulful and exquisite Sarah . This lady deserves to be in the same class as Ella and Billie , and deserves a place in everyone 's classic vocal jazz collection . Get this ! Relax ! Sing along ! Enjoy !
 Although many Moby fans have mixed feelings about his album ` Animal Rights ' , in my opinion it is his best work . Although he diverged from his common theme of techno/dance music to produce this more alternative/rock album , the final product is brilliant . Rather than mixing other pieces of music , Moby focuses more on his other talents , actually playing instruments and singing . The album contains both heavy and slow songs . Moby releases his rage with songs like , ` Say It 's All Mine ' , and ` That 's When I Reach For My Revolver ' , both very powerful songs featuring roaring guitars and Moby 's screaming voice above all . On the other hand , the album features some very relaxing instrumental mixes . Half of the album is consumed with beautiful instrumental mixes incuding , ` Now I Let It Go ' featuring a violin and piano duet , also ` Anima ' and ` Living ' which are both songs that take over all of your emotions . This album causes the listener to go through a mix of emotions which is why I think it is so unique . I love this album , it is much better than most of Moby 's recent songs which have somehow found themselves on top 40 radio play . ` Animal Rights ' deserves the rights to be known as Moby 's greatest work .
 I love that moby does different things and realizes that music is not set in boundaries . This album will surprise anyone who has the misconception that moby is just a techno or rave artist . The music on this album is strong , loud , angry , and then you hear `` Living '' and you relax . This album is emotional just like any of mobys albums . To realize why moby is amazing listen to this album and just feel it .
 This is a testament of the greatness of MOBY . The king of techno is also an amazing singer and songwriter and can thrash out some AWESOME jams.Returning to his roots as a punker , MOBY was once again ahead of his time , every song on this cd , from the beatiful violin tracks to the hard hitting fast paced garage thrash rock tracks and the cover of mission of burma 's `` Thats when i reach for my revolver '' are all amazing.I recommend to anyone who loves thrashing screaming rock , or just good rock music in general .
 At a time when `` electronica '' was coming into the mainstream , this electronic wizard chose to release a 100 % rock album . Disturbing and hardcore , this is one of my favorite of his albums -LRB- although you wo n't like it for the same reasons you like his other stuff -RRB- . Do n't let the other reviewers -LRB- who have probably only heard Play -RRB- fool you with their bad reviews - this is an excellent album -LRB- and as tuneful and accessible as some of his other stuff -RRB- .
 This is definately my favourite Moby album . It mixes some mellow ambient tracks that he 's famous for with exciting , incredibly fun punk-rock tracks.If you enjoyed ply a lot , you micht not like this , but that 's the risk you take . Personally , I like this a lot more than any techno he 's done , and it rates as even with his gospel stuff . `` Come on Baby '' , `` Alone '' , `` Someone to Love '' and `` That 's When I Reach for My Revolver '' are highlights.Give this album a try . You might like it .
 This album is for the true Moby fan . It 's very good , but stretches the limits in both directions with no middle ground.Half of the tracks are frantic , near punk as Moby screams to a frenzied beat . The rest of the songs are mellow , relaxed and hypnotic . The best of these is the Eno-esque , `` A Season In Hell '' . The remake of `` That 's When I Reach For My Revolver '' is a great rock and roll number - and the only one like it on the album . Moby brings out the violin on `` Love Song For My Mom '' -LRB- literally -RRB- and it 's hard to tell if it 's synthesized or real . The best song -LRB- IMO -RRB- on the album is `` Living '' , simply a pleasant song and worth the price of the entire CD.I could have done without all the pontificating in the liner notes and the pleading message , `` please listen to Animal Rights in its entirety at least once '' , however nice a gesture it was . It 's the music that really counts here . Moby seems to have been unsure which direction to take here , but just a few of the songs make it worth the listen .
 If you are going to buy `` Animal Rights , '' this is the version you should get . It comes with an extra CD titled `` Little Idiot , '' unavailable , as far as I know , on its own . Yes the first disk is evrything everyone has already said , but I bought it for the second disk - a subtle ambient synthesizer work of 9 lyricless pieces . Soothing and peaceful . In other words , a direct contrast of the Animal Rights CD . You are cheating yourself out of half of the story buying the `` domestic '' version . Go ahead and be a little daring , splurge for the import .
 This is an amazing disk . I personally love almost everything I have heard from Moby , but this album rates in the top three . `` Living '' is perhaps the most beautiful song I 've ever heard . The sounds of this album are soft , then hard , then soft again . It all works though . You wo n't be dissappointed .
 this record is so good ! I have listened to it over 100 times in its entirety , and I 'm not tired of it ! Its a departure from his other music , but it definitely lives up to the creative genius that Moby is known for . I love Moby , and all of his records , to me he can do no wrong . ANIMAL RIGHTS ROCKS !
 Whilst Animal Rights certainly is n't the best CD to introduce you to Moby , it certainly stands as an amazing testament to his ability to go rock . Moby was into punk as a teenager , and this CD harks back to his roots , with an intoxicating sound of guitar punk with just a dash of trippy beats added in to give it a distinct sound . Come on Baby and Someone to Love particularly stand out as fantastic tracks . There is a level of shine and discipline to this punk which makes it different to traditional punk music , but it only really serves to make the experiment sound even more interesting . Moby , as a truly excellent musician , plays guitar very well in addition to keyboards and all the other instruments he plays on his more recent classic Play and other older techno albums like Everything Is Wrong and I Like To Score . Even these albums show off some guitar work , and so it is fantastic to discover what it sounds like when Moby cranks up the volume of the guitar , puts it onto overdrive , and rocks out . And while there 's a time for techno , pop and neo-classical from his other albums , sometimes rocking out is what you want to hear .
 He 's a little strange though . Fed up with the dance music scene , Richard M. Hall decided to go back to his punk roots and produced this album . It 's pretty good to , if you like Moby 's rock angle . All you disco bunnies should run away and hide though.It 's odd that this , the UK version of Animal Rights -LRB- released several months before the US version -RRB- has a slightly different track list to its American counterpart . Well , not so much odd , as just plain annoying.Let 's get one thing straight
 In this album Moby uses his guitar a whole lot , do n't expect anything like Play , think `` All That I Need Is To Be Loved '' , and `` What Love '' from Everything Is Wrong .
 This is am amazing album . It covers every end of the spectrum . It kicks your bumcheeks one minute , and caresses them the next . And in some cases , such as the track `` Face It '' , it does both at once .
 If you are not interested in the dull , grey , median , this cd is for you . Moby is flirting with the edges of the extreme , from trashy songs like Someone To Love and Heavy Flow to songs that are themselves a mix like Say It 's All Mine towards the more usual Moby stuff . A pity most Moby fans do n't like this.I do n't see him do better than this ever ...
 Rare , very rare piece in Moby s catalogue , in the days were Animal Rigths were recorded Moby stated that he left listening techno and electronic music for a while and started to listen Metal and Hard and wanted to do something different , the final result is this collection of tracks loaded of dense sounds , chaotic vocals and adrenaline , recordings are not overproduced , you can even somethimes listen strings scratch , static sound , and echoes that reflect some lack of care in the details but you can be certain that all this is part of the album concept and sound , that have the intention to own a dirty and jamming atmosphere , please check `` thats when i reach for my revolver '' , Animal Rigths would be definitelly the only album i recommend from the descendent of the author of Moby DickHM
 this album rules , any dumb critic who says otherwise has no clue what their talkin about.moby is a wiz at the guitar . check out come on baby 's guitar solo at the end and youll see what i mean . the ambient/classical tunes are uplifting too . try to get the uk double cd , 1 disc rock , 1 disc quiet . it is so much better than the us release , which feels more like a compilation.one of rocks most underrated , like saturnzreturn and combat rock !
 Fresh off of `` Everything Is Wrong '' in 1995 , everyone expected Moby to remain in the world of dance/dj culture forever . They were wrong . In this album , Moby shatters his reputation as a prominent dj with shattering drum explosions and pulse-pounding guitar riffs . Moby is not just another boring fad . He is a talented musician who , in this album proves his can expiriment with a different sytle of music , and come out as always
 on animal rights , moby lets his hair down . Actually he doesnt have any hair , so he just rocks out . This is moby getting back to his punk roots and giving no one what they want . This album came out when `` Electronica '' was all the rage . Instead of sticking to his dance roots , he made a album he wanted to hear . You might not want to hear hard rock for the future , but moby does . So if you are feeling a little sick of dance , buy this record and rock out to moby 's pink rock future .
 As it 's already been said , this is a double cd . The first disk consists of mostly punk rock escapades with some good guitar riffs in between to take them into other levels but never losing a slightly sampled/electronically distorted sound . The second is an ambient disk with calm , relaxing but mournful melodies , simple but very beautiful . Listen with caution though , because it can get a bit boring if abused . All in all i think this is great recording both because of the standalone quality of each of the disks and because of the beautiful contrast you get by putting them together .
 Listening to the song ` Alone ' right now compels me to write this review . If nothing , buy this CD only for this track . A 10-minute long epic ambient composition . Showcases the genius that Moby is . There are several other very good songs on this album . This album is predominantly hard/punk rock with some softer ambient pieces sparsed in between . Most people know Moby for his work on techno and ambient music , but here Moby shows his versatility by doing an equally good job with hard rock . Many of the songs have him screaming at the top of his voice , but rest assured , they are still good and not average hard/punk rock music . Again , Moby shows that he does n't go by what sells . Rather he goes by his artistic instinct and likes to experiment with different genres of music.Most of Moby 's works are highly underrated and misunderstood . This is one of them . Moby 's music is intelligent music . Unfortunately , not many people can understand or appreciate that .
 Moby 's second foray into punk rock -LRB- his first was the song ` What Love ' on is 1995 release ` Everything is Wrong ' -RRB- , ` Animal Rights ' is an interesting look at the pathos of an artist . The songs are emotionally raw with lyrics much grittier than what Moby 's usual club clientele would expect . Not ` rock ' enough for the typical fans of the genre , and far too much rock for the typical fans of Moby , it 's quite easy to see why this album did not sell as well as Moby 's others . An objective look at the CD and its songs however , reveals it to be quite elegant in its own respect . The lyrics are not watered down or commercial , and the music is not the same three cords we 've come to see from some of the more garden-variety rock bands .
 One of my favorite albums by Moby . It has touched my soul and moved my body , a million times over . I love it .
 This is the perfect marriage of heavy and soft via Moby . Who knew that the little electronica man had metal in him?It 's amazing , and remains my favorite Moby album by far . `` Face It '' is the best !
 I will keep this short , Animal Rights is Moby returning to his rock roots as a lot of these songs are punk-oriented . Not a lot of people had much respect for this album because it is so UP AND DOWN , which is true if you have the US version which contains a few tracks from the bonus CD that this version contains . I had respect for this album because it was , believe it or not , something pleasant to hear when I wanted to move towards something with more anger and emotion . The real TREAT lies with the bonus CD -LRB- Little Idiot -RRB- . I remember getting this version of Animal Rights when Amazon only had about two listings and I took the cheapest out of the one of two still new copies . I already had the US version so I kept the bonus disc and lent the LE version to someone else . Little Idiot holds some of Moby 's most rare ambient tracks , inlcuding a different version of ` Love Song For My Mom ' using more of the quiet/soothing keyboard melodies instead of the violin playing . This has to be some of his best ambient work since his other ambient bonus cd in his recent album , Hotel . If you can find this used in great condition or even new at a low price , get it when you have the chance . That 's my review , thanks !
 This is my first Moby Album and I bought it because to the track `` That 's when I Reach for my Revolver '' . I was surprised upon listening to it and it 's kind of fun ride of emotional settings . Harsh and Heavy tracks intersparsed with Mellow and Soft . If you 're eclectic then you 'll love it all ! Here is an album for the soft hearted -LRB- Techno New Age -RRB- as well as for the Rock freaks -LRB- Sort of Industrail Trash what ever -RRB- . Buy it and see the prodigy out of Moby burst to your ear . For the Dance affeccionado this is not for ya , but give it a try you might like it !!!
 This album is very different from the rest of moby 's albums . And also kinda choppy as it goes from lots of guitars to very mellow -LRB- some would call depressing -RRB- . This album holds my favorite moby track which is song # 11 called Alone which was the song that got me hooked on him . It is a long instrumental that has a simple repeated rhythm that is built apon throughout the entire song . Even if you do n't like the heavy guitars , the mellow songs are still worth purchasing the album .
 this cd is wonderful . good solid songs , but if your a moby fan you might not like this one . as it stands i am not a techno fan . my ex put in this cd and i was blown away it is wonderful ... thats when i reach for my revolver thats when it all falls apart ... dam good
 Few albums sound good regardless of mood but when nothing else seems to satisfy this eclectic gem always hits the spot . One of my favorite albums of all time .
 I bought this album when it first came out and loved it . It real showed a side of Moby that was hinted at in a lot of his techno albums . He really shows his chops by basically giving the middle finger to his critics by letting his talents shine . Even though the tone is different and he sings a lot more , this is still Moby . Beautifully crafted tracks that swell and pulse with the same energy as his electronic tracks . The pacing of the album makes for a wonderful journey . If you like Moby or concept albums this is a gem ...
 Putting samples aside , Moby displays some of this catchiest work on this album , and the instrumentals are incredible . Some of the tracks are a little weak , sure , but for the most part this is a fun album . And it 's not just a big aggressive body of heavy guitar . I would n't say it 's as good as Everything Is Wrong , which people tend to lean on when comparing to this album , but in itself this album is strong , and the b-sides are worth heavy listen too .
 Animal Rights is one of those rare albums that come only once every so often ... Something that manages to take two different styles , and place them side by side . Punk and hard rock , next to ambient and experimental electronica . Barely two minute songs next to a 10:45 one . Screaming guitars next to a soft piano . Animal Rights is a great album that deserves more credit than it has gotten . This should go down as one of the greatest albums of the 1990 's .
 This album is easily the best piece of work Moby has ever done . No filler `` commercial '' tracks like his last two albums , no over the top techno like his early albums . A sweet intoxicating mix of hardcore and ambient songs . Thought provoking .
 Moby 's `` Animal Rights '' is n't what you expect to hear from a musician whose known for such songs as `` Go '' and `` Bodyrock '' . Moby used to play punk rock back in the day and he seems to be exploring some of those roots in this album . But do n't get me wrong this is by no means a punk album ; moby just cranks out the guitars and drums for a bitchn ' good ride . He does n't abandon the electronica element completely with stellar tracks `` Alone '' and `` A Season in Hell '' which seem to juxtapose the other guitar driven tracks . You can expect more lyrics than other moby albums , but they 're not written in the CD insert . The CD insert does offer up some refreshing moby rants about animal rights and the christian coalition . This is probably one of the best concept albums of the 90s ' and hopefully opened some doors for other electronic musicians who want add some rock to their music .
 This album is solid from beginning to end . Every song is worth listening to , and there are maybe three or four songs that I 'd rate at five stars.This is a great followup to `` Ya Got ta BG . '' His sound changes a little bit , and he has a few collaborations on this album . It definitely feels like a natural progression , though . If you like this CD , definitely check out Young Joker 's `` Who 's Laughin ' At Cha ? '' and Marv/Mitch and Lemay 's `` Livin ' In The Strange . ''

 I have at least one copy of every album -LRB- 24 -RRB- that Glad has ever done , going all the way back to two vinyl copies of the first album -- I wore out my first copy ! I love their `` a cappella '' music , and my two all-time favorite songs are both `` a cappella '' -LRB- `` Hallelujah '' and `` Amazing Love '' -RRB- , but , to me , this is the greatest album they have done , with a `` 5-Star '' from me on each and every song . These songs are perhaps the most deeply moving and spiritually challenging , real `` meat '' in the topics and issues they deal with , plus true `` fun '' in `` Variations on a Hymn '' at the end . I have found myself coming back to this album over-and-over again , since I got my first `` vinyl '' copy in 1983 , for inspiration and encouragement , and I hope you will too !
 The harmony and pure musical quality of Glad is always a welcome sound on my car stereo , long road trips and made much more enjoyable by being able to `` belt out '' along with the guys and praise Him while driving . This particular CD does n't have quite as many `` peppy '' sing along songs and some other selections I own , and I still have to say my favorite is , oddly , their Christmas CD `` An Acappella Christmas '' any time of year . We received an email from another Glad review from a fan looking for the recording with the different versions of `` Joyful , Joyful We Adore Thee '' explaining an amusing possible chronology of contemporary Christian music . This is the CD with that dialogue and recording on it , if it helps you now I hope ...
 This album is one of the last created by Glad before entering what would be their final phase
 One of my all time favorite Glad Albums . Music I grew up listening to . Great CD !
 I have been a fan of this group since college days in Fellowship of Christian Athletes - this CD is both inspiring and worshipful .
 I have bought this album several times over the last 15 -LRB- ? -RRB- years , in different forms , and it is still one of my favorites !
 I have loved this recording ever since I first heard and bought it on a hissy cassette tape in the late 70 's ; since then the sound has been cleaned up and you can hear Rogg playing with a grandeur and an over-arching grasp of the music 's shape which I believe has never since been equalled , The master performance here is of Bach 's own master work , the `` Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor '' ; the finest piece of its kind that I know , the `` Toccata and Fugue in D minor '' not excepted . Rogg has a marvellous grasp of the architecture and pacing of this wondrous work and the colour he draws from the organ by his choice of stops is a delight
 You are unlikely to find Lionel Rogg on the boulevard at St Tropez walking with Karl Lagerfeld and his precious pooches . Word has it that Pierre Berg&eacute; himself has banned Lionel from the premises of Prunier . Macau 's casino-owners breathe easier at the mere mention of his name
 With so many recordings of Beethoven quartets available in today 's marketplace , what would be the appeal of this one by a young British quartet ? For starters , there is the program , which features three of Beethoven 's quartets , two from his `` middle '' period and one from his final days , presented in chronological order . But what really sets this disk apart is the approach of the players , who come from Britain 's `` historically informed performance '' school . In performing these works , they have gone back to versions of the scores that indicate ways of playing that are somewhat different from what we are used to hearing today . For example , there is more slurring between notes than we are used to hearing in modern performances , and the bow is used differently from how it is used today.The result of these differences in performing style is a sound that is different from what we are used to hearing . I really enjoyed the Eroica performances of Opp . 74 -LRB- the `` Harp '' -RRB- and 95 -LRB- `` Quartetto Serioso '' -RRB- on first hearing , but their rendition of Op. 135 was disappointing to me in that it seemed to lack energy.Having listened to these performances many more times , I quite enjoy the disk overall . Although I still find Op. 135 to be bit on the tame side , I must admit that this approach works well in the slower portions of the work.All things considered , then , this is a highly recommendable recording of truly great music , especially to those who already have one or more recordings of these works and would like to hear what an alternative stylistic approach might sound like . The warm sound quality and informative liner notes make this release a top-notch production in every respect .
 When I first heard the cd I was a bit shocked . These musicians really have a unique way of playing these pieces . I am quite used to period performances of romantic music but this feels really unique . The more I listen , I start to appreciate and understand the point in using the playing style that they do . I realize that this is very close to the way it ones sounded and that is very exciting I think . The lack of constant vibrato and the glissandos that are frequently used creates a completely new atmosphere which I think is very suitable for this music . I really recommend this disc and believe that the Eroica quartet has a bright future ahead of itself . And that what they do today ... will shape the sound of tommorow !
 For the lover of classical music there is perhaps no greater thrill than listening to a well known piece and feeling as though you are hearing it for the first time . The period instruments have provided these works with the sorts of sounds vonB would have expected his audience to hear . In contrast to other reviewers on this page , I found the Opus 135 finally emoting what modern string instruments are incapable of expressing . After all these years the 16th String Quartet finally makes it 's contribution to the full portrait of the artist . This is the Beethoven I have loved all my life . This is Ludwig the Promethean madman .
 I have 5 brothers and numerous Uncles who live for hunting and fishing , this CD fits them to a T . This has given us great material for family reunions and birthday skits . We all have a relatives like Shad-Rapp somewhere in our closet .
 Shoot ! Der It Is ! is the perfect song to get you excited to go deer hunting . And even if you 're not a hunter , these guys are great ! They rap about fishing and drinking and having a good time . It 's really funny stuff !
 I have heard many , many albums in my time , and this may well be the best of 'em all . Lush melodies , regal arrangements , sharp vocals , and the unparallelled pop stylings of John Lennon and Paul McCartney . Favorite songs include `` A Day in the Life '' and `` Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds '' . These guys have made beautiful music in the past , but this is one for the ages . A MUST buy .
 `` Zirkus '' is Mias third release and its sweetest one , too ! Mia used to be known as playing punk music with some electronic influences . While their first release `` Hieb & Stichfest ; '' was all about electronic music with a punk attitude , `` Stille Post '' - their sophomore - was right inbetween electronic and punk music . Being controversially discussed in Germany for their song `` Was es ist '' because of the political somewhat patriotic contense Mia wo n't disturb any left-winged interest groups with their new album . `` Zirkus '' is all about love . Almost all songs deal with subjects like falling in and out of love . The lyrics are well-thought and playful with the German language . Mieze - Mia 's female lead singer - has improved her vocals a great deal . Her voice blends in really nice with the rest of the music . As a reference to this album 's title some of the songs have hints to the theme circus . There are even some circus noises in the background.When it comes to the songs , `` Zirkus '' first single `` Tanz der Molek&uuml;le '' is just right to represent the whole album . It 's a very positive , joyful song about being in love . `` Tanz der Molek&uuml;le '' was even in the German Top Ten . A success which the band has never had before.However , `` Zirkus '' is not really punk anymore , neither lyricwise nor musicwise . Some might be disappointed by that . Others might just now begin to appreciate Mia 's music . I just think it 's beautiful .
 People buying the Carmelites for the first time will usually and rightly go for the EMI set with Dervaux conducting and the irreplaceable Denise Duval as Blanche . But if , as Amazon.com suggests , the EMI set is now unavailable , this 1980 French radio recording is a very fine alternative - and an absolute must for lovers of Regine Crespin 's distinctive timbre . Crespin , as the prioress , and the young Felicity Lott as Blanche , are outstanding . Diction is of course key in French opera
 All of the songs on here are covers of older song except for the last one `` Brave Reality '' , but please do not let that stop you from getting this CD if you are a fan of Evergreen Terrace . They have done an exceptional job at makeing some good classic songs even better . They still manage to keep that sound we all know , love and expect from Evergreen Terrace . This CD gets better and better everytime I listen to it . It has from Tears for Fears -LRB- Mad world -RRB- to Smashing pumpkins and offspring . Its a little sort only having 10 songs but what would you prefer , a CD with 10 great songs or a cd where you only listen to one or two songs then switch cds ? Ill let you decide but I give this cd my full recomendation .
 I love these guys . They 're extremely tallented and they put a spin on songs that are at best mediocre and make them phenominal . I know this was n't meant to be a huge cd for them , but damn skippy , they did it anyway .
 the only two covers i listen to are the sponge cover -LRB- `` plowed '' -RRB- and the smashing pumkins song `` zero '' which was done incredibly well . `` zero '' is worth your money for the whole album but do n't count out the others.evergreen terrace has potential and i think this is a great way to get this hardcore band 's name out there .
 Evergreen Terrace blows the doors off the originals on alot of these songs . It 's true that some of them do n't exactly seem to work with the band 's hardcore style , but others like `` Zero '' are simply awesome ! These guys produce an unusually good cover album , which is hard to do , especially with idiots using Classic Rock beats in Rap now ...
 Ignore the closed-minded opinions of people like `` digestin fecess '' -LRB- does n't the name just scream `` intelligence '' ? -RRB- or others who think that this is a serious release by Evergeen Terrace . If you want to base your opinion of Evergreen Terrace , do n't bother with this CD , do n't bother with `` At Our Worst '' , pick up `` Burned Alive By Time '' and thank me later . Evergreen Terrace is a great band but what this album is , is just a release for the FANS to tide them over for the release of their next album . There 's nothing new or innovative here , E.T. never intended for this to be a monumental release for which people can revel in it 's infinite glory . It 's fun , it 's simple , you already know most of the songs , and when they play this stuff live , you can finally dance to U2 without looking like a moron ... I think ... Enjoy !
 Evergreen terrace has always been one of my favorite bands . They are one of the few in the hardcore/metalcore scene today who have found a way to make the genre their own . And with `` Writer 's Block , '' they have created a cover 's album worth listening to.Eevry song covered on here is a winner . They have found interesting ways to create popular songs , especially on U2 's `` Sunday Bloody Sunday , '' and Offspring 's `` The Kid 's Are n't Alright '' . And the hidden track , a meddley of Poison 's `` Every Rose Has A Thorn '' and the Spongbob Square Pants Theme is completely hillarious .
 Evergreen Terrace found such a creative way to cover some great songs . I think this album is amazing . If you truly love hardcore you will enjoy the music that has been recreated . Wether it 's a depeche mode cover , or a U2 cover . But , do not take this album seriously as to their musical abilities . This was just a quick release for fans to eat up while they worked on their new album ...
 Now I do n't agree with some of the articles on how much this cd sucks cause if you like constant grindcore and growling then there is no way you would like evergreen terrace , and covering songs is a way to show appreciation for that artist . On the other hand some of the covers turned out a little weird , like their op ivy cover of knowledge , and for some reason they covered part of bodies by drowning pool in an acoustic , then go into spungebob . okay so that is odd . but there are some great covers on here like bloody sunday , this is by far the best cover of that song i have ever heard . and if you do n't agree with me go listen to bad vulture 's cover of it . This Cd is though only worth buying if you really like evergreen terrace , If not , let your friend buy it .
 Nothing beats their cover of sunday bloody sunday '' , it 's just plain amazing . anybody that disses this album does n't know what great hardcore is .
 The whole CD is amazing . With covers such as `` Maniac '' by Michael Sembello , `` Zero '' by the Smashing Pumpkins and `` Sunday Bloody Sunday '' by U2 this cover CD does not disappoint at all . I must say though , that the best song on the CD is the Sponge Bob Square Pants cover after the secret song . Who 's with me ?
 I ca n't say that I like every song on the album , but there are 5 or 6 excellent covers on this CD . ` Mad World ' -LRB- Tears for Fears -RRB- , ` Stars ' -LRB- Hum -RRB- , and ` Plowed ' -LRB- Sponge -RRB- are all really great covers and have a much heavier tone than the originals . The ` Sunday Bloody Sunday ' -LRB- U2 -RRB- cover is one of the best on the CD and is really worth checking out . ` Zero ' -LRB- Smashing Pumpkins -RRB- is another really good cover and even the Offspring 's ` Kid 's Are n't Alright ' almost sound better than the originals . A definite must own for any hardcore/melodicore fan .
 Excellent cd . The remake of U2 's Sunday Bloody Sunday must be heard ! I ca n't stop listening to the song . As for the rest of the cd ... it 's great . Ca n't say it 's their best but it is worth buying .
 I really have enjoyed the styles of Dino Kartsonakis . This Cd has some of Dinos best recordings . You 'll love Battle Hymn it really creates a mood , in fact all of Dinos music does that . By the way any Dino product listed on this site is well worth purchasing I own just about every item mentioned on this site and I 've been listening to Dino for 20 years .
 I bought these for my 90 yr . old mother-in-law because she likes to listen to piano music , especially &#34; Dino &#34; . It made her happy to receive something for Christmas she really wanted instead of an unwanted bottle of perfume or lotion .

 This is a very promissing debut album from a band that is working in 2004 between Paris and Reunion Island to record a 2nd album.The singer -LRB- nicknamed `` blanc blanc '' -RRB- sings in english and has a superb voice close to Toto 's Steve Lukather 's voice or some powerful scandinavian hard rock singers . This CD includes a beautiful instrumental track called `` Strange ''
 Sounds like a young Rod Stewart , but better : -RRB- Did not find one bad track on this album !
 I am a big fan of industrial/ambient/experimental electronic music . I am also a fan of anything cEvin Key . My favorite industrial band growing up was Skinny Puppy . This is one of cEvin 's side projects and it is more ambient and experimental than Skinny Puppy was . It is more like Download . The Dutch Flowers EP was a great EP . It took me a little longer to obtain than I liked but I was so happy when I received that package . If you like electronic , ambient , and experimental music you should check this out . Music for Grass Bars is also awesome . The Plateau project was a collaboration between cEvin and Phil Western . Another brilliant mind in the electronic music scene .
 An outstanding collection of some highly collectible Latin music . Compiled by one of Britain ` s top Latin stalwarts - Gerry Lyseight . Another quality release in the `` Spectrum '' series from BBE .
 This is a great album . I 've worn out my cassette over many years , and it was a dub . Com ` era Dov ` era is a trip ! It will stay with you and haunt your dreams .
 This is one of those albums which was ignored and misunderstood in it 's time and is now virtually non-existent . He Said is Edward Graham Lewis from Wire . Fusing equal parts sophisticated songcraft -LRB- think Kate Bush/early Talk Talk -RRB- with industrial beats and structures -LRB- think Cabaret Voltaire -RRB- , this album was too slick for experimentalists and far too experimental for any mainstream consumption . If you are into early 4ad , Some Bizarre , Talk Talk , The Canterbury Now or even early Peter Gabriel then you MUST own this album . Brilliant , haunting and unique . Six stars !!!!
 Track Listing for Cassette Version
 If you missed this album you missed a stunning piece of history in the musical musings of Gilbert & Lewis of Wire fame . The other reviews are descriptive enough so I will leave it at that .
 For fans of Congotronics this is a must buy . Konono No1 makes better music with car parts and other scraps than rock groups with thousands of dollars in amps and twenty piece drum kits . Konono No1 's music takes you into its groove and never lets go . Like it says on the sleeve PLAY LOUD ! The ancesters are surely pleased .
 If you have n't heard this particular band , you 've never heard anything remotely like this music . I like this album even better than their first one .
 This Cd is great , it helped me through a really difficult time . I use to own a tape but it got destroyed ; however , Iam looking for the cd now and it is very hard to find ... I really need this album it 's a life changing gift .
 this CD has a great mix of contemporary and traditional gospel music . i lost the casette many years ago and just HAD to get one of the songs . `` I Found God '' is one of the best.I guess it 's no longer in print and hard to find , but it was well worth the extra money for me .
 What can one say ? Here is Monteux , aged 88 , on tour with his beloved London Symphony at the 1963 Vienna Festival . It is a live recording , with generally very good sound . All you can say after hearing it is , Where did that kind of music making go away to ? Romeo and Juliet is given a reading full of passion and drama , even if Monteux has no conductorial tricks up his sleeve . Ogdon 's playing in the Concerto is excellent , and quite remarkable for being captured in one take . Horowitz said that the three best accompanists were Barbirolli , Monteux , and Ormandy , in that order . You certainly can hear the wisdom of that remark in this performance . Monteux is with Ogdon every bar of the way , still making interesting points of his own throughout the accompaniment . The only performance of the Concerto I 've heard that packs as much electricity as this one is the live Horowitz/Toscanini , and that has some shallowness that Ogdon 's does not . As for the Symphony , it is a classic rendition . Monteux made a fine recording of it with the Boston Symphony , but his live version has a frisson all its own . As an interpretation , it may not surpass Dorati 's or Klemperer 's , but it is wholly satisfying and builds to a superb conclusion . As an example of Golden Age music making caught on the wing , this set would be very hard to equal .

 This cd is totally awesome , Ridin down the southside strip bumpin this ALL damn night long in the 2011 summertime BABY ... A TOWN PLAYERS FROM THE A.T.L. ... LET 'S GO !!
 If you enjoy DJ Magic Mike this CD is in the same caliber . I was surprised It had all low end bass with scratchin what I am into . Many of some of the same beats Magic uses but with there own style . This is Strip club , booty dropin ' , bass CD I enjoyed it . Favorite Tracks 2 . A-Town players in the house 7 . A-Town Drop Re-mix 8 . Kizzy Hurt 'Em and more . Cop it .
 I ca n't add substance to the reviews above , but I would like to note that this album is magical and transforming -- as in , I listened to it this morning during drive time and floated through the traffic , scarcely noticing it and not being bothered by it . And as in , I 've been playing it continuously now for about five days . It 's that good .
 Though he can probably put out a relatively good CD every year for the next decade or so , the recent output of Arto Lindsay has been solid but disappointing . So it 's a pleasure to report that Salt is his best work since Mundo Civilizado . It helps that he has his metaphysical lyrical bent under control , and concentrates on the body . Eroticism never seems to fail him ; nor do his eccentric rhythms and innovations on the Brazilian sounds of the day .
 Arto Lindsay is not afraid of challenging his listeners , as has been evident in all his work . Though this album is probably the least challenging of his catalog , at least in terms of the atonal , terse -LRB- and wonderfully composed -RRB- skronk that finds its way into all his recordings , `` Salt '' is easily his most cohesive work to date . As always , the seamless mixture of electronic beats and soundscapes with lilting tropicalia and samba riffs is present here , but on this album , some may say it is even danceable . Though American xenophobes will probably write this album off as just another world beat disc , if it was n't so labled by msucial ignoramuses , I could easily see many of its tracks finding its way into hipster lounge/clubs across the country . As always , Lindsay 's feathery , well anunciated lyrics float above the textured percussion and a trebble clef populated by guitars , synthesizer and a string section . I would definitely recommend this to those who appreciate inventive truly inventive music-making . This is one of those CDs you 'll play while driving with a friend , and they will inevitably turn to you and ask , `` Who is this ? This is great . ''
 Arto Lindsay succeeds in effortlessly crafting an amazing mix of musicial genres that might seem incongruous in the abstract . Initially I was turned off after listening to the first two track . The first , habite em mim , didnt appeal to me but has improved upon subsequent listenings . The second , Kamo-dark stripe , I still feel is unbearably icky . But having got that out of the way , this is one of the most superb albums Arto has made in his solo career . Personagem incorperates a catchy theme of bouncing electronica played over an interesting guitar riff . Twins is perhaps my favorate track on the album . It begins with a studder-stepping riff which is joined by a floor shaking beat . The song continues to studder musically while Arto lays ontop his smooth vocals . Guitar noise joins the mix at exactly the right time . Arto punctuates the mostly English lyrics with a really catchy lyric in Portuguese . The next song , Into Shade , is beautiful , simply stated . The classical guitar interlude and close are breathtaking . jardim di Alma is nice and also notable for a bizarre refrain sung in what I assume is Japanese . this track and De Lama Lamina also employ guitar noise to great effect . The final two tracks are sexy and great as well . Barring the first two songs , this would be on my top 20 all-time album list . ~ Alex
 I first heard of these guys because they were going to play at a bar near my house , so I picked up the CD and they rock , there is not a bad song on this CD , it is good from beginning to end . If you like anything by Theory of a Deadman then you will like this CD .
 I enjoyed this CD as much as the Under The Western Sky CD which isone of my favorites . It really gets you in the Xmas mood
 You 'll love this album ! I have lots of Christmas music but ` Christmas Under the Western Sky ' is without a doubt my favorite ! It 's a collection of Christmas classics performed in an easy listening but upbeat country instrumental sound that is never tiring .
 I bought this tape for my four year old because she is crazy about dinosaurs . As a four year old , she likes to hear her favorite music over and over ... before bed , during our long drives in the car , etc. . That means that I have to hear it as well . I am a singer with a trained voice and some of the kids music I have heard can make my skin crawl . This tape is the absolute exception ! It is very well done and educational . My older children ; ages 7 , 9 , and 13 enjoy it as well . But , they also loved the musical `` Cats '' .
 This is a fabulous album for dinosaur fans of all ages . A pair of lively dinosaur dance tunes frame an album of largely lyrical songs that allow various dinosaurs to introduce themselves . Despite the title , this is Broadway , not Rock & Roll . -LRB- See `` Dinosaur Rock '' if you prefer real Rock & Roll . -RRB- In a style remniscent of `` A Chorus Line '' or `` Cats , '' the album features surprisingly imaginative melodies and lyrics with a synthesized accompaniment . The lyrics make only fleeting reference to the more gruesome aspects of dinosaur life , making this album suitable for listening in mixed settings with younger children . With well-crafted , interesting songs in a nicely paced album , this is a CD your children can listen to over and over again without driving you nuts.As a side bonus , listeners get some genuine education with these songs . From `` thick-headed '' Pachycephalasaurus to `` Mother Maiasaura '' gaurding her nest of Hadrasaur babies , the songs feature accurate descriptions of dinosaurs -LRB- based on current scientific knowledge -RRB- that easily complement information available in non-fiction dinosaur books available at any public library . It 's an amazing treat -- a science lesson that comes on stage and sings to you . It 's also just plain fun , with tunes you 'll find yourself humming again and again .
 Sergio Tiempo is in his mid 30 's ... about the same age as Kissin.He is much better known in Japan and Europe than in the U.S.This record should help make him better known to the American public.His interpretations are youthful , passionate , and poetic . His playing is not middle-of-the-road and he is not afraid to bend aphrase or slightly alter a tempo but the result is always interesting and musical . His technique is superb but he never tries to impress based on technique alone . The recorded sound is excellent and you will want to hear this CD again and again .
 This CD is the sum of all winners
 Being a pianist for over 70 years , I can tell you that Sergio Tiempo is almost in a class by himself -- a super-virtuso . . Dazzling technique , wonderful insight in the music he plays , and has the best Gaspard de le Nuit of Ravel I personally ever heard ... It simple shimmers with shades of gold and one can feel the sea-spray and mystery of the sea ... the Russian music of Moussorsky is beyond wonderful ... Such musical excitement is hard to image , are rarely encountered in a pianist relatively young ... treat yourself to some of the most exciting pianism you will hear ... BUY THIS CD AND ENJOY THE WONDERFUL PLAYIN OF THIS YOUNG MAN11
 This is HOTNESS ! The lyrics are tight , the beats are BANGIN ' , and the guest performances -LRB- like JuJu from the Beatnuts -RRB- make you crave for more . This is real Hip Hop from the core and along with the rawness they even got 2 bangin ' joints that not only cats but females will wild out in the club for - `` That 's That '' , and `` What it is '' got me mad hyped . Whoa ! `` Hotness '' is my shhhhhhh ! Al Tariq -LRB- formerely known as Fashion of the Beatnuts -RRB- is at peak form and he flows with ease . Problemz got the illest lyrics and that cat Black Attack 's flow is MURDER ! He makes me wan na mcee ! Linx , I 'm always looking for the new joints to play and pump in my ride and when I hear your record , I FEEL YOU ! Good looking ! To all you young cats , old schoolers , semi-Hip Hop fans , thugs , females , club cats , and non-Hip Hop heads alike - COP THIS CD if you want to be inspired or just wild out !
 Julius Katchen was considered one of the world 's best pianists when he died tragically of cancer at the age of 42 in 1969 . This 2-CD Double Decca Import title , Volume 6 of `` The Art of Julius Katchen '' series , easily shows why . This set focuses on Piano Concertos of the 20th Century , and CD 1 begins with Katchen performing Gershwin 's Piano Concerto in F with Mantovani and his Orchestra , a mono recording produced in 1955 . Next Katchen renews his magical partnership with conductor Istvan Kertesz and the London Symphony Orchestra on both of Ravel 's Concertos , first the one for Left Hand , then the G major , originally produced in 1966 and '69 respectively . CD2 begins as number one did with Gershwin , this time Rhapsody in Blue again with Kertesz and LSO , and also from 1969 . Next is a valuable 1954 mono recording of Katchen performing Britten 's Diversions for Piano -LRB- Left Hand -RRB- and Orchestra with the composer conducting the LSO . Finally the set concludes with Bartok 's 3rd Piano Concerto , once again led by Kertesz with the LSO from 1966 . The pianist recorded a mono version of this Concerto with Ansermet -LRB- recently reissued on Testament -- see my review -RRB- , but Katchen 's stereo account is even better , despite the fact that there is a horrible tape splice in the Adagio at around the 6:45 mark . In all , many of Katchen 's vintage performances have been available sporadically stateside , but these Australian imports are the best way to currently get all of his glorious Concerto recordings .

 My first listen to `` Sin Disease '' left me speechless . I just could n't believe my ears . Allan Aquirre -LRB- aka Ramald Domkus on the liner notes -RRB- unleashed his unique voice and musical and spiritual forcefulness on us , and the only word for it is inspired . Like expressionist painting , `` Sin Disease '' throws quite a bit onto the canvass . And like an expressionist painting that strikes our fancy , it 's hard to define why , specifically , we like it . `` Sin Disease '' has a certain brilliance about it that 's hard to describe but obvious upon hearing.In contrast , `` Jawboneofanass '' reveals more standard musical expression . It 's less chaotic , the songs have grown in length and structure , and it sounds more atmospheric and moody -LRB- thanks to the keyboards -RRB- than `` SD '' . What has not changed is Aguirre 's unbelievable voice , though he may have reigned it in a bit . `` Jawboneofanass '' does n't make the immediate impression that `` SD '' does , and it is n't quite as satisfying . Which is not to say that it 's any less uncompromising . Aquirre evidently never compromises his message or intensity.The comparisons of Aguirre to Bowie are apt , but they do n't capture the ferocity that Aguirre unleashes when he sings . Like Bowie , Aguirre is a fearless and unselfconsious singer who 'll try anything . The difference lies in the fact that Aguirre seems to sing as if he 's on a mission and has an important purpose . It 's for this reason , on top of the brilliance of `` SD '' that this two-album set is worth having .
 Scaterd Few led by singer/writer/musician Allan Aguirre were and are truly revolutionary . Sin Disease is perfection . Another reviewer said it well in regards to their relevance and uniqueness , `` like System Of A Down before they existed . '' The way Scaterd Few blend styles and moods make this easy to listen to straight through . It is truly an adventure . This is a great double-disc set , but it is missing Kill The Sarx part II -LRB- Apocolypse -RRB- which is a seven minute mind trip that needs to be heard and experienced , but the songs from Jaw Bone are great too , so this is a worthy purchase . There are a total of 4 Scaterd Few cd 's and I highly recommend them all . I also recommend all 3 cd 's by Allan Aguirre 's other band -LRB- sort of goth/pop -RRB- called Spy Glass Blue . Check his website -LSB- ... -RSB-
 I got the `` Sin Disease '' mc in -92 , I guess , but lost it before long . After many years , I heard that the Scaterd Few drummer was going to do a concert with a band at a place in Oslo . After the concert I told him that I 'd been looking for `` Sin Disease '' for many years . He was very generous and gave me a copy of this record I 'm reviewing now . `` Sin Disease '' is a bold and genuine and creative album . I do n't like `` Jawboneofanass '' , but I 'd give `` Sin Disease '' five stars even if it was coupled with annoying ringtones .
 Christian System Of A Down , before System Of A Down existed .
 Boy ! For the budget price this piece of LIVE ELO is a steal . Looks decieve in that regardless of cheap cost the music here is excellent and indeed worthy of many listening hours . It 's both well recorded concert , executed musicianship , and a flash back to yesterday ! For the price , what more can one say but this one is worthy of listening to . Ca n't go wrong at this price for quality music and a quality recording .
 The Bond -LCB- cd -RCB- is great!All the songs are worth listening to , including the remixes ... 1 . Atlanta is a nice piece with an epic sort of feel , nice beats and effects ... 2 . Time has a baroque kind of feel , great beats as well ... 3 . Fuego -LRB- Caliente Mix -RRB- is a remix of the song Fuego from their album `` Shine '' , this song outshines the original in more ways than one like in the remix you can hear the talent more clearly and it has a more Spanish sound ... 4 . Shine -LRB- Indian Summer Mix -RRB- is a remix of their single on their latest album of the same name `` Shine '' , this song is the mix they used for the video and the differences are subtle but the sound and the effects are more Ethnic than the original .5 . Speed -LRB- Crash Club Mix - Radio Edit -RRB- is a remix of their song from the latest album `` Shine '' , `` Speed '' , this song has a nice beat and a trancey sound . It sounds like a remix by Darude , the beats are very trancey but sadly the Quartet itself is barely heard from all the production.Overall the EP is great with a bonus DVD including the 2 promotional videos and the Shine EPK , sadly the DVD is region 2 and you need an all region player to playit or your DVD-Rom ...

 the msot beautiful song in the world
 somewhere between the Pogues and Les Negresses Vertes come Les Hurlements D'Leo . These guys are great with a happy sound full of horns , fiddle , guitar and energy ... There really is no equivalent for them with modern music in the states , Id reccomend looking them up on the internet and geting samples of sound from their website.If youre familiar with the Rough Guide to Paris Cafe Music CD , youll recognize Les Der Des Der , but all the songs are great on this ...
 6 crushing songs from an obscure Seattle-based metal band who 's sound falls somewhere in the broad death metal genre , but with concentration on songwriting instead of endless riffing . It 's sound is effortlessly memorable -LRB- track 5 , `` Navegante '' , is a sure-fire metal classic to be -RRB- and modern without resorting to experimentation that diludes newer bands ' albums . The band even shows off it 's ability to hold your attention through the 7 + minute instrumental , `` Sindios '' , that shows flourishes of classical and spanish-style guitar . Definitely a band to watch . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 I had seen some ads for this album but the first time I heard this band was when one of my best friends in Canada received a copy from his buddy in Greece . I must say his cover is way nicer looking then the US release but the cover will be the least of your worries when this music addresses your ears . This serving of super finely done speed / power metal fires off with a song that is also the album title and once you hear about four seconds you will be hooked . The entire album rocks as a whole and never relents or lets the true metal head down . On first listen lots of the songs sounded the same but upon further listens they are indeed individuals each to themselves . The guitarist may be young but man can this guy shred . The album is unique in that it was put together in so many different areas of the world too , with this added here and that added there.I would surely include this offering on my favorite album to listen to list . I am most certain that any metal head needs this one , cause if you do n't have it and your friends do you will look uninformed. , not to mention be without your daily requirement of important metal in your diet ! I can hardly wait for the next one but this one will be hard to beat.The `` Firewind '' has blown alot of us away and lit the fire for more stuff like this one . Buy or cry !
 A while back a friend of mine came to my house praising this album as if it was a god and saying how the guitarist -LRB- Gus G -RRB- was the best new guitarist out there . Being a fan of Stephen Fredrick 's other band Kenziner I had my bud shut up so I could hear the album and I then understood his excitement.This is some blistering metal . Just when I think that I 've heard all the great bands out there another one comes out to punch me in the face and Firewind did just that . Gus G may be the next Malmsteen only without so much of the guitar wanking . And Stephen is in top form here , belting out every song as if it was his last.So if you want some scorching TRUE metal check out Firewind . You wo n't be dissapointed .
 Though mostly known for their latest achievement `` Allegiance '' , this very first Firewind album competes closely with the previously mentioned release in terms of quality . `` Between Heaven and Hell '' is an impeccable album yet very different from Allegiance . This early line - up is put together by Greek metalheads Gus G. -LRB- guitars -RRB- and Constantine -LRB- bass -RRB- who join forces with American power metalers Stephen Frederick -LRB- vocals -RRB- and Brian Harris -LRB- Drums -RRB- . The composing chemistry of Gus and Stephen is solid and colorful , coming up with inspired riffs , melodic solos and incredibly catchy choruses . In terms of technique things do not get much better than this
 The following is from my review of Burning Wind , however , I talk about Heaven & Hell quite a bit , so I just pasted that review here : When I first heard Between Heaven & Hell I was blown away . Here was an album worth listening to again , and again , and again . I got to the end of the first song and said , this is awesome ! And I just HAD to listen to that song over again.I thought the same would happen for burning earth . I was wrong.It 's a good album , but nothing really blew me away . There was only one song , # 5 , where I thought after , that I wanted to relisten to it again right away.However , on Heaven & Hell , I had that feeling , that desire , on songs 1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10,11 & 12 . -LRB- 4 and 8 I thought were basically the same song ... -RRB- It took me days just to get through the entire cd just because I kept replaying the same songs over and over again . They were THAT damn good.Heaven & Hell songs had awesome hooks . The rhythms just infect you and before you know it , you 're foot is tapping , your head is nodding ... Only one time , during the first minute of song # 5 , I got that silly grin on my face , my head started nodding , I sat forward in my chair , here it was I thought ! FINALLY ! After 4 so-so songs , a song that had my attention . But that was pretty much it . Just like `` Oceans '' on Between Heavan & Hell , song # 5 on Burning earth was just way too short , almost an incomplete idea . It 's like they were playing , and somebody just started the fade out even though the song was n't done . Maybe it was an accident , I do n't know . The second -LRB- and only other -RRB- instrumental song on Between Heaven & Hell was n't like that at all ! A complete song.So , bottom line , if you 're a fan of this genre , you 'll enjoy Burning wind . It 's good for a spin here and there . But I 'd say I was pretty disapointed compared to Heaven & Hell.When I got Heaven & Hell , I thought to myself , from this point forward , FIREWIND is my new favorite band . Heaven & Hell remains , and will remain , one of my favorite all time cd 's , but as far as FIREWIND is concerned , they 're no longer at the top of my list . The last band that fell off the top of my list was on their 10th album before they crapped out , so , this is like a world record for the rise and fall , in my humble opinion ...
 When I had my first glance at the name `` Firewind '' and its album title `` Between Heaven And Hell '' , I was convinced that such band would not offer me anything of new or interesting ... Fortunately my thoughts were wrong and Firewind amazed me and certainly will amaze all listeners of well done heavy metal.If this album has a winning glow , a huge contributor for that is the singer Stephen Fredrick , a true magician of the voice . He gives this band heaviness with talent and melody with passion . Firewind is also crowned for having 21 years old guitarrist Gus who is not playing with great creativity , but is not stealing notes from other bands and even shows a wonderful technique allied with thirst for good music.Bass lines are the ones that a power metal group needs and drumsgo higher than expectancy . Tunes such as `` Warrior '' and the fast `` Destination Forever '' confirm why this record is so fun to be listened . A true ace that provides us hours and hours of great metal without getting boring ... Do not underrate this band , you might feel a certain sorrow later ... Firewind is truly raging !
 I read a very good review of this Firewind album and thought I would check them out . I am very glad I did as this album rocks . Firewind play a very heavy style of power metal which is one reason I like this album so much . A thick muscular guitar tone is in the forefront and drives the songs powerfully . Not a very original album but Firewind uses the basic metal melodies and riffs and just seem to do it better than most other power metal bands . They also aviod the `` power metal cheese '' which is another big plus . The songwriting is great and captures you from first listen . The singer is also one of the best I have ever heard . Not one of those high pitched girly singers many power metal bands have but rather a very bassy powerful voice with excellent range . His voice is unbeleivable , actually sounds like a barbarian , such raw power . Like he injected his vocal chords with steriods . The guitar leads are simply mindblowing by a 21 year old fenom named Gus G . However they are not that original either just your basic Malmsteen type shredding all over the place . Very taleted , lightning fast and accurate but not much creativity . A lot better than having no leads though and they are fun to listen to . Overall this album has serious balls and is one of this years top ten for me .
 Somebody please help me !! I 've had the chorus for `` warrior '' stuck inside my head now for 2 days and I ca n't get rid of it.I guess that 's the price one has to pay for listening to a cd that is so damn appetizing . From start to finish it was like a rollercoaster ride that you thought was never going to end and were momentarily depressed when it did end but quickly realized that you can ride it all over again.With this release Firewind have raised the metal bar to a new level that many peers in the genre will find difficult to rise to . After listening to Between heaven and hell all other metal bastions seem small and irrelevant . The majority of metal seems to run on two tracks - the track of melody and the track of brutality . Most bands seem to compromise one in order to achieve the other . Very rarely does a band successfully fuse them both together but Firewind has done just that and also manages to add creativity to the songwriting that makes each song stand on it 's own rather than just recording one song ten times and disguising it as a full length album . You get the impression that these guys are sticklers when it comes to quality and do n't just release whatever they record . There 's probably alot of material that ended up on the cutting room floor . In other words they go through painstaking efforts to sift through all the rock to collect the gemstones and discard everything else.OK that 's it now . If you like blistering , headstrong power metal with a a heavy dose of POWER your collection wo n't be complete without this CD . I rarely give albums a perfect score but I think this one for certain deserves it .
 This album is one of the best power metal album i have ever heard . THere are full of really amazing solos that i have missed so much from the nowadays albums . It reminds me Helloween and Dream Theater . If you like power metal dont even think not having this album . They rock . Buy this album immediately if not sooner
 while this is n't my favorite Firewind CD it 's a nice listen , not as deep as later CDs by any means , and there 's nothing seperating this one from any other power metal bands , but it 's an enjoyable listen . as it 's a rerelease you get some of the demo songs they submited , and this really give you the feel of a band starting out .
 firewind is absolutely the best band that no one has heard of ... in a word - this is the best power metal album i have heard - or should i say it along with Testaments The Gathering are tied for first place . . this is blistering power metal at its best - talent without equal on every instrument ... great album highly recommended
 Awesome metal band , great vocals , astonishing guitar work from Impresario Gus G.great keys , bass & drums speed up the mix , whole cd reaches out & grabs you , very well worth the purchase , five stars !
 2002 's Between Heaven and Hell was the debut album from Greek power metal band Firewind . Firewind , of course , is a side project of Dream Evil -LRB- and now Ozzy Osbourne -RRB- guitarist Gus G . This was one of Gus G 's earliest albums , and he was aided by guitar legend David Chastain , who helped recruit vocalist Stephen Frederick and produced the album.Between Heaven and Hell is probably the weakest of the Firewind albums -LRB- this band got better with each new album -RRB- , but it 's still a better than average power metal offering . Gus G. is a phenomenal guitarist who knows that songs are more than just shredding . Yes , his solos smoke , but there are plenty of great melodies too . Stephen Frederick was a good match for this kind of music , bringing range and plenty of power to these songs . The only real drawback is that the album is pretty formulaic . It 's a textbook melodic power metal album . A good one , to be sure , but nothing you have n't heard before.It may not be the most original album , but Between Heaven and Hell is still a well-written and well-executed effort with some pretty amazing guitar work . If you 're new to the band , I 'd recommend starting with the excellentThe Premonitionand working backwards to this album.Edition Notes

 If you are over thirthy , you should remember single '' Never Never '' made by The Assembly in 1983 . It was -LRB- and still is for me -RRB- great hit . Hit made by ex Depeche Mode and ex Yazoo member Vince Clarke and performed with invited singer Feargal Sharkey had a hudge success in summer of 1983 . Another one thing on CD single is instrumental '' Stop/start '' , performed by true members of Assembly - V.Clarke and E.C. Radcliffe , is good , but it do n't compare with '' Never never '' . You should choice U.S. single version just for one simple reason - extended version Never never with sad Clem Clempson guitar intro . The price ? It does n't matter if you are looking for this for seventeen years !!!
 I always dug this album . Marvin Winans handled the majority of production and the well-orchestrated songs are not necessarily dated . I liked Vickie Winans most around this time and this type of music seemed to suit her more . The stuff she is doing now is okay , but it seems to me that she was really singing then . I love `` God Of Comfort '' and `` Stay With Me '' . You can tell that at this time , R&B recording artist Anita Baker was an influence in her vocal style . `` Victory '' was a nice uptempo track as well with drum programming that was ahead of its time in gospel music .
 SHE IS TRULY ONE OF THE MOST SINCERE , SWEETEST SOULS THAT CAN EVER BE FOUND . THIS ALBUM MINISTERED TO ME SO WONDERFULLY . IT INSPIRES ME STILL TODAY . I AM A GREAT FAN OF HERS THAT PLAY HER MUSIC OVER AND OVER AGAIN . MY SONGS OF INSPIRATION WERE `` VICTORY '' AND `` THE LORD WILL MAKE A WAY '' . THESE SONGS HAVE MINISTERED TO ME THROUGH MY MOST TRYING TIMES IN LIFE . ALL OF THESE SONGS I LOVE SO MUCH , BECAUSE VICKIE SINGS WITH SUCH A POWER FROM THE LORD THAT IT IMPACTS YOUR LIFE WITH A GREAT CHANGE . TRUST ME YOU WILL NEVER BE THE SAME , SO GO OUT AND GO GET THIS ALBUM . YOU WILL TRULY BE BLESSED . GOD BLESS YOU VICKIE .
 Thank you seller , the item downloaded quickly and arrived in good condition , no skips . I love this cd and listen to it almost everyday ! Thank you , thank you , thank you , I could not find it anywhere , in any stores . Will definitely dobusiness with you again . D
 Praise The Lord Vickie!Just wanted you to know i really enjoy this cd it really ministers to me my favorite is , STAY WITH ME . Everytime I listen to it , it has it 's way of getting in my heart the words are powerful and gripping . stay encouraged vickie . keep 'em comin . Love you always and your music . Thanks for sharing it . Be Blessed !
 great album and great delivery but it is all instrumental which is something that I failed to notice so only have myself to blame . Everything went great .
 Track listing :1 . Medley 1
 As a DJ in Wash. , DC , I 've keenly followed the evolution of beats and bass from East London , spanning from late 80s acid house parties , to hardcore `` rave '' breaks , then jungle , drum 'n' bass , speed garage , UK garage and now grime/eski presently.If you 're looking for drum 'n' bass or hip-hop this CD is n't it . But if you 're a true fan of either of those genres this IS essential listening material . Lady SOV 's rapid-fire Cockney slang over air horns , punchy bass and scattered breakbeats encapsulate on CD the raw pirate-radio vibe of East London that heavily influenced the rave/jungle/drum 'n' bass -LRB- as well as dancehall , garage , techno -RRB- subcultures . Here in the States the totalitarian power of the FCC would never allow this to happen , but the fact that in the UK it was -LRB- and still is -RRB- somewhat tolerated , millions of Londoners have access to this music as it is made live on the airwaves every day.For open-minded hip-hop fans , this CD yields more evidence that New York is n't the mecca of urban music culture it 's made out to be . Comparing the creative diversity of music styles or the sheer volume of weekly new releases between the two cities , London easily wins . And it finally seems that Londoners know this fact -LRB- and are rightfully proud -RRB- . But hey , let 's not get into NY vs London or Grime/Drum 'n' Bass/Garage vs. hip-hop . Both cities and styles are influential on -LRB- and influenced by -RRB- the other . Listen to Twista , Timbaland or Missy to hear the UK influence in American hip-hop . And drum 'n' bass has liberally sampled US hip-hop for over a decade , both lyrics as well as beats.Unfortunately , the dominance of pop and mainstream r 'n' b on American MTV and radio prevents many from experiencing the genius that London has to offer . Hopefully CD 's such as Lady SOV 's and others in this genre will bridge the differences . And now that Jay-Z has signed her , anything is possible ...
 Rap can be a very interesting genre sometimes . While it is primarily overrun with mumbling men and unintelligent lyrics now , there are certainly still some good things about it . And quite possibly the most interesting thing happening in rap is grime , which is a mostly cockney-accented british rap scene that has been growing for years and has finally begun to boom . The Streets , Dizzee Rascal , Wiley , Shystie , Kano ... just a few of the names . But the artist that i think will get the largest amount of attention comes in the smallest package
 This pint-sized potentate of rap is like a female , slightly more diminutive Eminem ... I do n't know much about hip hop , so I do n't have the vocabulary , but LS lets off some great , hilarious streams of Cockney rhyming ... -LRB- aside
 Lady rox ! Ch-Ching ! 1 - Random - It 's her hit single . But it 's the worst song on the album . What I mean is it rox - all the other ones are just better . -LRB- it did get me out of my seat -RRB- 2 - Ch Ching - Unlike Random , BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM ! . Upbeat , and a 2 - second sample will get you out of your seat ! 3 - Fiddle With The Volume - Fiddle of the roof - I get bored just typing it . Fiddle With the volume - YES ! ROX ! 4-A Little Bit Of Shh - I wonder if she said like a little bit of f**k for me or something or if it 's meant to be shh duh shh5 - The Battle - Good but with a 30 second sample I never heard Lady .6 - Random Remix - Better .7 - A Little Bit Of Shh Remix - Better than first .8 - Fiddle With The Volume Remix - Good but first is better .
 Hiphop as a genre is so wide spread and international that sometimes we get wonderful creative jems like Lady Sovereign . She is not only lyrically impressive , but the mixes of electronics on all her tracks will get you moving , which is basically what she sets out to do . I dont know much about the hip hop insprised grime scene in the UK , but i will definitely be keeping on eye out now . And i will patiently await for S.O.V. debut US album.Favorite Track , though all of it is really good , will have to be `` The Battle '' feature other grime scene artists like Shystie , Zuz Rock , and Frost P spitting the wildest -LRB- barely understandable lol -RRB- rhymes ive heard . No men and women have battled against each other like this , especially for the listening public.How ever , no one should compare SOV to anyone -LRB- Missy or M.I.A. -RRB- All emcees , particularly female one have a different style and should be prasied for such . SOV has a style totally different from anything ive heard to date . It 's refreashing to see a new spin on HipHop .
 S-O-V ! i 've had this disc for almost a year and still listen to it several times a week . she 's funny and spits strong rhymes over tight beats . its tough to pick just one track as a fave , `` the battle '' seems to be # 1 for most , but `` fiddle with the volume '' really showcases Sov 's flow . but beware gangsta-rap fans , this is not tough-guy , bling , guns , drugs , rides & hoes -LRB- c -RRB- rap . Sov had a rough childhood in London , but this ai n't no pity party - she laughs at herself -LRB- even when she talks about not having a decent place to sleep and her cat dying -RRB- and her jabs at others are clever . pick up this disc if you are looking for a few giggles and something fun to bob your head to . ca n't wait for Public Warning -LRB- on Def Jam ! -RRB- - due out 10/03/06 . i have no doubt she 's got 50 more things to say , in a cheeky kinda way .
 Yep , the girl can rhyme but the real star here is the production . Somewhere between garage , jungle , and hip-hop , these beats just keep on coming . Completely different than everything out right now . Ok , so ` Random ' has a Diwali-type rhythm ... it 's been flipped on it 's ear . I ca n't wait to hear what comes next .
 Got this because im a big fav of SOV . All i have to say is WHOA ! Amazing set of tracks , wicked remixes and all around awesome !!!
 A white british girl with a side ponytail doing an impression of a jamaican yodeller . It 's not a drug-induced hallucination , it 's Lady Sovereign . Surreal insanity to the max . I luv it .
 Rap has been waiting for this for a long time . Call it grime or whatever , i could care less . lady sovereign is simply amazing but the beats are just as important also . Ive listened to some of her songs that didnt have these kind of beats and it just doesnt work . I know she signed on jay-z label and if he smart he wouldnt change a thing . it is really important that she builds from this ep and doesnt remake her style . anyway , i havent been this excited about a rap album since mos def . think mia with lyrical talent . peace
 If you like M.I.A. or Missy you 'll like this . Straight out of London .
 Aight , I agree wit awesome , american rap is gettin boring , uk grime is cummin 2 da u.s. lady sov has already released dis CD in da u.s. she was signed by rockafell , more artist like her r cummin big , BABY BLUE , SHYSTIE , ROll DEEP , Lots More , Buy Dis CD Itz Nang .
 i hate american rap . it is so lame . it was hot when it first came out like 25 years ago , now its just lame . now Uk heads are making this sick grime stuff overseas , i think US needs to watch out and rethink where we are heading .
 Mary has such a way with words . Yes , she 's got a potty mouth , but she pulls it off better than anyone I 've ever seen . Extremely clever lyrics highlight one of my favorite all-time , but way too short , albums . Her next album is on order , I 've been waiting a long time . This is a definate MUST SEE show if you are ever in the Maryland area .
 Mary 's voice is sweet and melodic , her lyrics sarcastic and misanthropic . Every track is a treasure , every moment a pleasure . If you love the f-word , especially when repeated seven times in a row with emphasis and heart , you 'll love this CD .
 After listening to Mary Prankster belt out `` Tits & Whiskey '' on the sunny streets of DC , I came away thinking either society is doomed or Mary is serioulsy ill in the head ... but then I considered what was going on next door in the White House and in the Capitol and Mary seemed perfectly sane . While certainly not one of those `` feel good '' albums , BSOD scores high on being just plain fun .
 Mary showcases an exciting and disturbing clarity of images in her first CD . There is a wealth of diversity in musical treatments .
 `` Blue Skies Over Dundalk '' is a phenomenal album . With a menagerie of real life truisms , everyone is able to relate to songs such as , `` Mercyfuck , '' `` Piss Off , '' and `` Green Eggs and Hamlet . '' The motley assortment of song subjects has one common theme , the reality of life . This near didactic album screams the unpolished views of the singer on the brutal truths of society . These truths are expressed in morbid lyrics with an upbeat melody that grabs the listener from the beginning . While several of the songs are about local Baltimore manorisms and customs , anyone who appreciates the fact that life is nasty , brutish and short should feel incomplete if this album is not in their collection .
 Not for my parents . Also not for the under-15 set -LRB- they got booed by the teenyboppers at a They Might Be Giants -RRB- . Clearly this is a group destined for twenty-something hell , and they know it . The people in the band are genuinely nice people , too , and they like what they do -- you ca n't beat that .
 Mary Prankster 's enthusiasm for full-throated rock and roll may be exceeded only by her fondness for the f-word . The combination is one virtually any rock and roll fan will appreciate . Her sound is reminiscent of The Beat Farmers , with an eastern feel . Mary 's work teems with references to her native Maryland , down to her Natty Bo cover art . The appeal of her stage personna , evident in her lyrics , is sure to cross gender lines . Her hurried entreaty for male company on the beach to share `` tits and whiskey '' sets the tone . Later , she pines for a boy who is not a violent sociopath . -LRB- So Mr. Beach has a few skeletons , does he ? -RRB- Later still , she delights in breaking a heart that instills the kind of pain that would prompt Cal Ripken to take a day off . -LRB- See ya , Mr. Beach . -RRB- Who among us ca n't appreciate the humor in that ? Best of all , Mary Prankster really , really rocks .
 to go eat at IHOP after listening to Mary 's song `` Breakfast '' . I ca n't get the song out of my head ; I 've been humming it , thinking it , whistling it , singing it , and generally annoying the crap out of my coworkers with it for the last two weeks.Mary clearly knows her drugs . Only acid could animate a syrup bottle in such detail.I got lucky -- someone posted a couple of tracks to an MP3 newsgroup . Thank God for MP3 ; without it , I probably never would have heard of this weird little album.All the songs are generally great , notably `` Blue Skies '' '' *** Off '' and `` Mercy *** '' , but `` Breakfast '' deserves to hit # 1 . Buy it , you 'll love it . You too can get lucky .
 Mary Prankster 's Blue Skies Over Dundalk is a brilliant debut that showcases the bravado and insightfulness of Liz Phair mixed with the humor of Jeanne Garafaolo . Like her influences , women will surely look up to her , and men will surely want to sleep with her . My only complaint is that the CD runs less than a half hour . Even so , I 've yet to be tired of listening to it .
 How refreshing that someone is still making real rock and roll . Ms. Prankster has produced a heady mixture of caffeinated and intense musicianship with lyrics that tell the story straight from the view of the edgy bad girl . Her music has the pop appeal of the Go-go 's and the urgency of the Violent Femmes . It also has an overt , frank sexuality all its own . As you listen , you can picture Ms. Prankster thrusting her hips at you while pleading for an opportunity to go down to the beach to break out the tits and whisky . Moments later , you can also hear her unrestrained glee as she breaks your lustful little heart , and as the blue skies magically appear over Dundalk .
 The cd just has Mary before the Power Trio like with Roulete Girl has but the greatness of Mary Prankster 's music is still there . I is a great cd.Mary Prankster and the whole band are the GREATEST band still to be playing clubs . They are so good I am still surprised they are not nationally known . I will do my part and spread their music . Everyone I have let listen to my Mary Prnakster CDs have love them and I know you will too .
 I fell in love with Mary Prankster 's music the first time I heard it . Clever lyrics and playful tunes make this a CD I have yet to become tired of . Short , but every track 's a gem . Highly Recommended .
 mary prankster is porbably one of the most ear-catching bands i 've ever heard . the music is very catchy and well-written , some songs are funny , like `` mac & cheese '' some you dont know if they are funny or serious as in -LSB- Mercy ... -RSB- but even though you would n't blast mary in your car while on vacation with your parents , i think there 's some mary prankster in all of us . you just need a little jumpstart . it is true mary is n't for smaller listeners , but as soon as you listen to this cd , you 'll come back for more .
 Mary Prankster 's first album is rough , bitter , cynical , dark and amazingly addictive . She 's , um , brilliant . It 's really worth it .
 Mary Prankster is the best band I have ever herd . She is a taleted musician but what takes the cake are here lirics . They are saterical , funny , and smart . SHE ROCKS . Get the CD NOW !!
 This album was great , Mary Prankster is the best band and Mary herself is the queen of girle punk rock . Both of her albums are stellar and she is great live as well .
 This Cd is extremely hard to find . A treasure in the technological world -- truly splendid !
 This is great to see and hear on one cd!The Frond are , pretty much , just Nick Saloman on this set of songs ! But he can make some classic sounds here that rival the original `` classics '' ! For all who 've never heard this stuff ... Mr.Saloman plays burning `` hendrix-ian '' riffs throughout this beast of an album , and not only that he can spook-out into trippy psych realms too!His lyrics are introspective , and intelligent -LRB- sometimes playful too -RRB- . Loads of fully satisfying riffs and lyrics , plus he can do a 20 minute song , by himself in the studio -LRB- his bed-room at this time -RRB- , and sound like a live band jamming in a Pink Floyd fashion . Incredible stuff!DO NOT MISS THIS , or THE INNER MARSHLAND CD !!!!! Classics of the future ... NOW !
 Nicely done reissue of Bevis Frond 's 1987 2-lp vinyl release . I 've seen this disc before but until recently , never even knew anything about it . After just one listen , I can tell you this is a must-have for true fans of lo-fi neo-psychedelia . Tunes here that did it for me were the fourteen-minute epic `` 1970 Home Emprovement '' , `` Rat In A Raincoat '' , the awesome `` Purtle Sline '' , the inspiring `` Soot '' -LRB- great wailing guitar work -RRB- and `` Alistar Jones '' -LRB- sort of reminds me of early T. Rex member Steve peregrine Took -RRB- . Essential .
 Bevis Frond 's music is a step back into the late 1960 's . Nomaatter what CD you purchase , you can not go wrong . Weather it be Inter the Marshland , Tryptich , Live , or any of the many CDs available , you will be very happy . It is not commercial , and is far from main streem . So , if you are a AC/DC fan , or Bon Jovi , or ZZ Top , stay away . But if you like bands like Cherokee Mist , or Oxford Circle , or anything out of the ordanary , this is the band for you .
 Despina is a very successful pop diva . Her soft voice dashes through the mellower tunes -LRB- I believe it & C'est la vie -RRB- , while it strikes like a lightning bolt on her dance numbers -LRB- Come along now & GIA -RRB- , not withstanding her powerfull interpretation of traditional greek songs -LRB- Ola Odigoun Se Esena , Lathos Anthropos & my favorite , Deste Mou Ta Matia -RRB- . Although she is no Anna Vissi , this album provides a nice mixture of different styles and it is very pleasant to the ear . It is great for a cocktail party as background music , but it is also very worth while taking the time to listen to it track by track .
 everything they put out is awsome great stuff guality music for any one to injoy i have all there cds and love them all
 Despina Vandi has been huge in Greece and Greek communities around for years now , and it looks like she is on the verge of taking over the English market also . Come Along Now , as well as the re-release of Gia , will introduce her to a new market . Combining musical tracks from Gia with new English lyrics should wow some . The music combines the traditional greek sound with modern pop and house beats -LRB- as do other great Greek stars Anna Vissi , George Alkeos , Peggy Zyna , Elli Kokkinou , etc. . -RRB- . Many Vandi fans will already have most of the songs on this cd , but for the newcomer this is a great building block . Her voice is as passionate as she is beautiful . And her songwriter Phoebus , as the Quincy Jones of Greece . Its brilliant . A must buy
 The CD starts off with Despinas ' Gia , and the music carriesthrough , with a solid performance to the last song.I Believe It -LRB- Olo Lipis -RRB- is an amazing song . This is modern music at its finest.The biggest drawback is half the songs are in Greek . The music is outstanding !!!
 Celebrated milestones do n't come much better than that of legendary folk-rock band Fairport Convention last weekend . Originally formed in 1967 , they wowed their fans with a 40th anniversary to remember after yet another triumphant annual festival in the heart of the Oxfordshire countryside.I was turned on to this group by listening to a CD of Judy Collins a few months ago , when she mentioned the death of a singer she knew , Sandy Denny , who sang with `` Fairport Convention . '' Well , right away I went out a bought a couple of albums and have been in love with the music ever since .
 Orlando de Lassus is one of THE premier renaissance composers if you ask me . His vocal music never fails to amaze with its skillfully woven polyphony and great harmonic rhythm.This work consists of several extended pieces . They are among the best of de Lassus ' works that I 've heard . The recording is first rate . Unfortunately , this price is a little high . Ok , it is ridiculous . I recently purchased a great performance of Hindemith 's Kammermusik on EMI for less than $ 10 . Why Harmonia Mundi charges so much is beyond me . I admit , their recordings are excellent and I love their sister -LRB- brother ? -RRB- labels . However , in today 's economy one should not expect to pay $ 25 per cd after taxes.In any case , if you can get your hands on Lagrime di San Pietro -LRB- de Lassus ' swan song -RRB- , then you absolutely MUST do it . That work is a more satisfying work than even this one.I give the work 5 stars , but if I could rate the pricing separately , I would give the price 1 star . Combined I 'll give a 4-star rating .
 In today 's alternative music swirl , it 's great to find a band whose music defies traditional categories . Sure , The Shadow Academy borrows from the best `` emo '' bands , but also incorporates quirky , edgy , original thoughts from darker groups , the Sixties , and even classical . The result is -- you guessed it -- music in the shadows between `` Night and Light '' . Alan Gant 's inspired words and vocals mix melancholy with mayhem and madness , and Tom , Dan , and Doug are top-notch in carrying off every tune . You 'll find songs to console , to motivate , to rave with , and even one to dream with . The Shadow Academy -- definitely a band to put on your list !
 This cd is Great Iam Not Only saying this cause he is my uncle , i belive if this is your type of music you will love this album , so in that.i can only tell you to buy the album and find out for yourself
 The reason I heard the cd is because it was made by my younger brother.I enjoyed it and so will those who purchase it.He has a powerful voice And a God given talent.He loves the lord!I am proud of my brother ! Love George W. Madgett
 This Album is simply the best James has released . Back In True Form . If you heard james music then buy this right away , if you havent heard Jamed Blundell before , Than you better get this album . His style of music is described as being a mixture of everything and the songs he sings are true , honest and warm . Thats why he is called a Master Storyteller . Every song is Beautiful . Ignore this album and it ` s your Loss .
 If you loved the song `` Do n't Go '' but wished the song could have been just a little bit longer , look no further than this my friends . This remix in a word , RULES ! The remix is awesome . An extended mix to song without bastardizing it . Perfect for those times when you want to relive your youth -LRB- or childhood in my case since I was 4 when it came out . -RRB- It stands the test of time !! If you love this song , you need to buy this .
 uno de los grandes clasicos de los 80s , de esos que marcaron un camino para muchos de esta generacion . imposible no contar con esta discografia !!!!
 This eclectic collection of songs for the holidays ranges from the sacred to the silly and probably is n't going to please everyone , but if you 're looking to shake up the holiday mix with something a little different this could be a good choice . Originally issued to raise funds for United Cerebral Palsy of Metropolitan Detroit , I found my copy in a truck stop bargain bin a few years ago . It was well worth the 3 or 4 dollars I paid.Contents : `` Sock it to Me Santa '' - Marshall Crenshaw with the Chisel Brothers `` Let it Snow '' - The Chenille Sisters `` Silent Night '' - Carvin Winans `` What Christmas Means to Me '' - The Sun Messengers `` Ma ` Oz Tsur '' -LRB- A Song for Chanukah -RRB- - David Syme `` Christmas in the Country '' - Mike Ridley `` Hey Hey Santa '' - Mitch Ryder with the Garfield Blues Band `` This Little Light O ' Mine '' - Gemini `` Twas the Night Before the Seventh Day of Chanukah '' - Ron Coden `` Gopak '' by Modeste Mussorgsky - The Detroit Symphony Orchestra `` The Christmas Song '' - Bob Allison
 I had never even heard of American Made until Alive Fest a few weeks ago . I was sitting at my campsite -LRB- which was across from the stage -RRB- and could n't sit still ! These guys are awesome - The punky music and the rapping lyrics gives this group a unique sound that I 've never heard before . Some songs are deep , and others are fun , but all are chuck-full of energy , fast drums , and wild guitars that wo n't allow you to slow down .
 This CD brings out the Christian punk in just about anybody . When I bought this CD about a week ago at an event called the Alive Fest . I got it signed by three of the four guys , and one of them wrote down a very memorable Bible verse , Proverbs 3:5 . I read it and it gave me the realization that Christian bands truly care aout how they express their music . I have never had so much admiration for a band . I love the lyrics in `` How We Roll '' because they say that they chose the life with Christ over a life without him and I really thought that that was cool . This CD will not disappoint you musically or religiously !
 American Made 's new cd Against The Flow rocks ! Truly original , you 've never heard any band like them ! A definite MUST buy ! Their shows are jam packed full of energy and excitement and you 're missing out if you have n't been to one ! Check American Made out I guarantee you wo n't be disappointed !
 i think that they are cool , i went to their concert and they were cool.later
 I first heard jimmie 's chicken shack when a friend brought there first major label release over adn tried to get me to play it on my guitar . That is when the affair started . since then i have bought every album they have . i bought this one while i was at a concert of The Shacks . The concert was awesome and so is this band , the cd does a great job of showing their energy live adn how much they can control a crowd . So if you want a great live cd adn you like good `` mutt rock '' as they are called , buy this album . i dont think you will be sorry .
 None of the available JCS albums does the band justice in terms of raw energy . `` Giving somethingback '' gives the listener only a small taste of the live performance - the forum in which this band truly shines . Although now down to two original members , JCS is still forging new areas of music with their self-proclaimed `` mutt-rock '' .
 Jimmie 's Chicken Shack really DOES give something back . They play great live , and are a lot of fun . This cd rally rocks , give it a listen !
 Giving Something Back is such an awesome cd . You really start to make a personal connection to the band with this record . They were n't as powerful live back then as they are now , but it 's still a great cd . You really start to see their personalities shine through , like frontman Jimi Haha 's humor . It 's also the only cd where you can get the song `` React '' , which is wonderful , and `` Vacuum '' . If you like Pushing the Salmanilla Envelope , then you will love this . All of your favorites off of that album are alive and kicking on this one .
 . . yes i am . . dont even try to argue . i met em all . i luv em all . This cd is suuper .
 SPIRIT-CHRONICLES 1967-1992
 Kevin Ayers , in my humble opinion is one of the most overlooked of British performers who emerged as part of the Canterbury Circus from the 1960 's . In many ways he is very reminiscent of that other English eccentric and borderline genius , the late , greatly missed , Vivian Stanshall.This timely re-release with additional tracks is a very welcome one for those of us who have owned the original cd for years and who have had to suffer the poor sound mastering . Here with much greater clarity is an album that is not to be missed.The publicity surrounding this re-release mentions the contributions of some others who perhaps have achieved greater success than Ayers but whose contributions here merely enhance the originality and vitality of this album.Kevin Ayers ' albums are idiosyncratic for two reasons , the quality of the songwriting and the diverse styles and types of music which he employs . His voice is so evocative of others in the Circus such as Caravan but has a way of bringing the lyrics slowly into one 's conciousness where the true value of them can be misseed when the listener is not paying careful attention . The lyrics can be subtle and oblique surreal and yet real . Or , to paraphrase another song strangely strange but oddle normal.The musicians that Ayers plays with also compliment the musical material with it 's vast range that demonstartes the breadth of Ayers musical knowledge and genius.The album begins with an Ayers song There is Loving and Among Us written by the composer David Bedford combined together and concluded with a reprise of There is Loving . Bedford 's orchestral contribution is the perfect foil for Ayers ' writing but does not come off as cheesy as some other orchestral additions tend to do -LRB- on early Elton John for instance -RRB- . Margaret and Oh My typify Ayers at his best with short songs great lyrics and measured instrumental work but for me the heart of the album lies in the following three tracks . Song from the Bottom of a Well deserves an award for the name alone but considering the use of effects and some techniques which could have easily been borrowed from KarlHeinz Stockhausen himself coupled with the exquisite lyrics this song must be considered one of the best Kevin has written generating such imagery . Awesome . The next track , which I always believed was for Welsh listeners Whatevershebringswesing , is a complete contrast to Well . This certainly lightens and brightens the ambience created by the previous song and demonstrates the creative energies which flowed from Ayers in his collaboration with others . Robert Wyatt may not be too well known in the United States but in certain circles in Britain he is revered for his contribution to the Soft machine and also for his personal songwriting contributions . Here he adds his voice to the song in a somewhat ethereal way to develop an excellent track . The next crucial track is Stranger in Blue Suede Shoes which the sleeve notes acclaim to be an Ayers classic . i do not know about that but it certainly was a fan favourite . An amusing song which went on to be another single release , this has everything that one could wish for in a three minute song . Polished performance , great lyrics and music to match.The rest of the album is made up of two original album tracks plus four bonus songs which had not been available except on singles and a compiliation but which fit well with the general tone and outlook of the original album.Like the fine wine that Ayers is reputed to enjoy , his albums are a little of an aquired taste which require a little concentration and which provide one with much cerebral enjoyment . This happens to be one of my personal favourites along with Joy of a Toy.A wayward genius he may be , an eccentric troubador for sure . I really like Kevin Ayers as you probably can tell and I have no hesitation in recommending this wonderful work to all Amazon readers . Enjoy !
 This is an excellent album that I stumbled upon . It 's very English , very English and sounds like a mixture of Soft Machine , Gong -LRB- it 's actually closely linked to both units where personnel is conncerned -RRB- and a whiff of Syd Barrett.Strange , weird melodies , silly lyrics but sincere performances . Great discovery !
 As a recent `` first time listener '' to this piece -LRB- shame on me -RRB- , I was most pleasantly impressed . I expected the music to be more challenging to the ear . That 's usually just fine but the dominance of melody in the songs definitely was n't a hard thing to handle . Each song seems to have its own individual approach - superb orchestrations by the legendary Mr. Bedford , some tender balladry , some Frank Zappa stylings , some blaring `` War of the Worlds '' horns -LRB- after all , we MUST have a few challenging parts -RRB- . Well worth repeated listenings . I know that for long time fans of this music , the alternate song versions are deservedly welcome , but I would have wished for some unreleased original studio material .
 After the experimentation of Shooting At The Moon , by Kevin Ayers And The Whole World , Whatevershebringswesing marked Kevin Ayers ' return to the songwriting styles of his debut Joy Of A Toy . This time however the production was far grander with a full orchestra arranged by David Bedford on the opening song , and experimentation with tape loops . Song From The Bottom Of A Well works particularly well , and his best known song , Stranger In Blue Suede Shoes , is included -LRB- in two versions -RRB- . Sometimes the experimental effects are merely distracting and irritating , as when a reprise of Joy Of A Toy Continued cuts into the middle of the stoned-sounding Champagne Cowboy Blues , and along with the whimsical Oh My is one of the weaker tracks.As with Joy Of A Toy , guest musicians such as Robert Wyatt -LRB- from Soft Machine days -RRB- and Didier Malherbe -LRB- saxophonist with Gong -RRB- appear . Whole World member Mike Oldfield contributed lead guitar and bass and gets a sleeve mention for his solo on the wonderful epic title track , though the Whole World disbanded during the recording of this album.Of the bonus tracks the B-side Stars is by far the best and perhaps should have been an A-side or at least on the album proper . Two songs were not released as singles , rightly in my view , but were then discarded completely and their inclusion here is welcomed .
 Just returned from a fortnight in the Ould Sod and despite any number of memorable sights and sounds what I seem to recall most vividly is scarfing down a huge bowl of porridge early one fine morning while the serenely wayward tunes on Whatevershebringswesing billowed up out of the jambox . Talk about yer full Irish breakfast ! And this followed by a brisk walk down Dun Laoghaire Pier with a 99 from Teddy 's our post-breakfast reward . Here 's another suspiciously pleasant consequence of Kevin 's combination of trippy baritone and sheet music , later that day on the morning presided over by Hairy Ayers I read in full , twice in full as a matter of fact , Donald Barthelme 's stupendously fanschmabulous short story , Me and Miss Mandible . This Don B immediately struck me as a feller well worth a further look see . Then I read Chablis and am in no doubt whatsoever about the dude 's bona fides . Chablis is a masterpiece of comic brevity , a compact and sturdy story built for speed and indeed crafted around the sheer exhilaration of synaptic snap and crackle . Plus the dog the baby wants in Chablis is named Michael which is almost as good a name for a dog as Desmond is in Pynchy 's Vineland . I have an inkling I am going to try and memorise this entire story for future reference . If Donald Barthelme 's sentences were shoes Tom Waits himself would wear a pair in a heartbeat . Chablis is a right crafty little gem along the same lines as Kevin Ayers ' own brand of perfection on any song you care to mention on his wonky little plate of rock candy here . Ayers might well be something of an acquired taste but positively no kidding this hirsute English song and trance man is chockablock with a soothing sort of soul for those with the lugs to tune him in and hear him out . I 'd go so far as to recommend almost any of his witty and wacky albums but this third solo effort here , circa 1971 , had me noddingly succumbing to some seriously high-toned nostalgia . Sandymount Strand , 3 in the AM . A wooden bench with the water audible and the moon of all things -- the big bleeding blooming moon -- eye-wateringly bright against the darkness of the sea . Home on me holidays . I 'd just bought the Kevin Ayers album second-hand in the George 's Street Arcade the day before and due to a mix-up with another record the dude in the shop felt so bad he lent me the loan of a little homemade cheroot from his own personal stash for me troubles and there I was at the end of the following day reclining happily on a seat on the macadamed promenade along Sandymount Strand with the whole of Dublin Bay stretched out before me in the moonlight . Later and later it got but I lingered on just generally digging the lapping of the tide and the moon on the water and the Pigeon House in the distance blinking on and off . Not totally inappropriately either I was singing happily over and over again that catchy calypso chorus to Kevin 's own Caribbean Moon : Hey Caribbean moon yellow , yellowCaribbean moon yellow , yellowCaribbean moon yellow , yellowCaribbean moon shine all nightWell of course then it was n't all that much longer before I was Singing a Song in the Morning : Singing a song in the morningSinging it again at nightI do n't even know what I 'm singin ' aboutBut it makes me feel I feel alrightYeah yeahMakes me feel I feel alrightChronic jet lag or some such irreversible neural damage precludes further coherent comment but let me leave yiz all with a last lump of lyrics , this time to a particular favourite Ayers track , Stranger in Blue Suede Shoes -- funny fantabulous how some songs stand spectacularly well the test of time . You really have to hear the groove on this track too though -- The Velvet Underground go to Canterbury : STRANGER IN BLUE SUEDE SHOESI walked into this barAnd the man refused ; He said , `` we do n't serve strangersIn blue suede shoes ; We do n't give credit , andWe do n't give way -- We have to think about what the people might say ... Uh , you know what I mean ... `` I said , `` sure , man . `` Oh , he gave me a smile that was sickly and wet , And I offered him one of my cigarettes.He took it , afraid that he might appear rude , Then proceeded to sell me some second class food.Nice guy - meet 'em everywhere ... He said , `` my oh my , I have suffered too long , And this cigarette seems to be very strong ; I do n't make the rulesI just get what I takeAnd I guess every rule was made to break.You can take what you like , it wo n't hurt meCause I 'm just working for the company . `` From the green cigarette , he took a long drag , And said , `` I think I 'll pick my travelling bag.I 'm tired of cheating , and wasting my headAnd filling the boss 's bags with bread.I want to get out in the sun and rain , And feel the wind on my skin again ; The world is large , and I 've got time yet.And , by the way , thanks for that cigarette ... Thank you very much.You know , I feel like a new manYes I do , I do n't know why ; I 'd just like to sayThank you very much -LRB- indeed -RRB- It 's a beautiful dayI think I 'll be on my way -LRB- right away -RRB- I 'd just like to sayThank you very much.Yes , I 'm getting the hell out of hereYes , I am - bye , bye.That 's the end of the messageThank you very much.Bye bye ... ''
 I did n't think there is any good rock coming out new anymore this new Saga cd is really good . well musicianships really good and the songs I was surprised how good the songs are . they are still putting out good music which is why nobody will hear it cuz if you have talent and if you play good it wo n't be heard . you play like you do n't know what you 're doing then you make money I 'm glad I got this saga cd if your a fan of good songs good musicianship or saga you 'll love this CD
 I knew the songs on the loose and wind him up from the 80s and always liked those songs finally got around to checkin out what the bands best cds are i found the very best of which has all there american hits so i started there . Being the the curious music fan i had to make sure that they didnt have any thing else worth while glad I did this cd I like almost as much as there very best of.PS I also liked Network alot -LRB- one of their hardest cds -RRB- and full circle was good -LRB- mostly the 2nd half of the cd -RRB- . The other cds that were n't covered by the very best of were n't as strong as a whole in my opinion only having a 1 or 2 exceptional songs at the most .
 I 'll make this short and sweet . This is one of the best modern Saga cd 's out there . Money Talks , Ashes to Ashes , and We 'll meet again are great rockers and `` Always There '' is a very beautiful Ballad.I never get sick of this CD , it has all the best aspects of Saga .
 This is another great bunch of songs from Saga . Back in the 80 's I got the vinyl for `` World 's Apart '' . Those songs just stayed with me when I 'd hear them . So , I decided to get HOUSE . I like to collect music so Amazon is a great place to do it .
 Showing quite a bit of variety musically and lyrically , this is a creative , original and interesting album . There 's a lot to like . I 've listened to it over and over .
 Possibly the best Saga album of the post Worlds Apart years - an inspired , consistent piece of work , elevating them to the status of prog masters . The classic Saga sound is all there , the dramatic vocals , the elegant guitar riffs , the keys/drums/guitar speed runs , the changing keys , tempos and atmospheres . Just for the two masterpieces , Ashes To Ashes and Once In A Lifetime it is worth getting the CD . The openers God Knows and The Runaway are superb neo-prog rockers bristling with energy and overflowing with creativity set the mood for what 's to come . The album just keeps on cooking and serving up surprises all the way to the chop-zilla showstopper of the album , We 'll Meet Again , another great Chapter song . Just when you think a song drags a bit , they deliver a killer chorus or a meter-defying instrumental bridge . There is even an instrumental - a kind of a piano interlude , rare on Saga albums . Technically probably the most complex and tight playing ever recorded by Saga . Production is superb , maintaining the atmosphere , clarity and balance of instruments and vocals . I 've said it before and I 'll say it again - Saga once again finds itself back on the trail which Genesis , Rush and Yes left and got lost !
 Saga has 3 complete CD 's with the Alien covers and 1 CD single , I beleive House of Cards is a Masterpiece .
 After hearing Saga 's return to form CD , `` Full Circle '' & loved it , I thought the next one would be as good or a little better , but I was wrong , this is a lot better , better hooks , better production , better feel.They have deftly created their best work since `` World 's Apart '' . The mix of prog & tasteful pop sensibilities is sooooo well done.I have been a fan of Saga since the 1st album in 1978 , & I guarantee you if you are a Saga fan this experience will be pure joy ! I listened to it 3 times in a row & that rarely happens-very special indeed !
 I first fell in love with the Saga `` sound '' when Heads Or Tales came out - for me , this defines Saga . I am pleased to say that with `` House of Cards '' Saga seem to have recaptured some of this sound , something that had been missing from many of their 90 's releases -LRB- with the exception of `` Security of Illusion '' -RRB- . I love everything these guys record , if only for the expert musicianship -LRB- guitarists take note
 I 'd rank this one up there w / Silent Knight and Worlds Apart -- proof that Saga STILL has more talent than 95 % of the bands out there !! Ashes to Ashes , We 'll Meet Again , & House of Cards are probably my 3 favorite tracks , though I 'd say that there is n't a bad song on this CD .
 With this album SAGA goes back to its musical roots , the `` chapters `` and the Sci Fi covers . IF you have the first five classic albums and the last recording `` Full Circle '' YOU WILL LOVE THIS ONE ! Best tracks are
 This is one of the best albums of Saga , it reminds me of ` worlds apart ' . My favorite songs : House of Cards , Runaway , Ashes to Ashes and Once in a lifetime.After the release of ` Pleasure & Pain ' i thought my favorite group was going down the hill , but then they released ` Full Circle ' in 1999 and was a big surprise since it was a return to their roots , now with this one its : WOW !!! there is not one song i dislike here . How come U2 or Dream Theater sell more than Saga ? this is an example that the best doesnt always comes first , at least not here . Bravo SAGA !! THIS CD ROCKS !!
 I first heard Saga when my brother bought `` Worlds Apart '' What a great one . Then I bought `` Heads or Tails '' on tape and listened to it until I wore the tape out . I had been in a retro mood lately and was looking for sounds that recaptured some of the excitement that music had once upon a time -LRB- I am 36 now , was 17 then ! -RRB- . I snatched up `` House of Cards '' when I found a single copy at Best Buy . What a great CD ! I went back out and bought a copy for my brother . These guys have matured a bit musically and still know how to mix synthesizer and guitar like no one else ! A great mix of hard driving and haunting sounds . Buy this SAGA fans , I promise you will love it ! Like most complex music , you might need to give it a few listens before your brain comprehends just how good this CD is . And like the first CD I heard , some songs seem to be written for me !
 This is Saga 's strongest release since their _ Worlds Apart _ and _ Head or Tails _ days . This is not their best work , but _ Hose of Cards _ is in the ball park . _ HoC _ builds nicely on their previous , very solid release , _ Full Circle _ , which I can also recommend.I must admit that Saga 's return to form is a bit surprise , albeit a very pleasant surprise . While their contemporaries struggle to find the magic that brought them their successes , Saga has indeed recapture their magic with _ HoC _ . All Saga fans should enjoy _ HoC _ .
 As has been written everywhere else about this CD , `` House of Cards '' is truly a return to form and yet a continuation of what Saga has been doing for the last 20 + years . However , after the brilliant , original `` Generation 13 '' -LRB- 1995 -RRB- , Saga 's next 2 studio CDs -LRB- Pleasure & Pain , Full Circle -RRB- were okay , but still missing something . `` House of Cards '' is the freshest breath of air to hit Saga fans in a long time . Highlights like `` The Runaway '' , `` Ashes To Ashes '' and especially `` We 'll Meet Again -LRB- Chapter 15 -RRB- '' will be welcome to longtime Saga listeners . Jim Gilmour delivers keyboard arrangements that evoke aural rainbows and chromatic soundscapes like no other . Most notable is Steve Negus 's drumming , which has been dormant ever since Gen 13 . His trademark fills and technical ability are back . Ian Crichton and Michael Sadler are as impressive as ever . Ian has got to be one of the most underrated and overlooked guitarists in the industry . Overall , this CD is excellent and hopefully marks a return to the classic Saga that grabbed my attention almost 20 years ago .
 I ca n't understand why these guys are not more popular here in the states . The music on House is their tightest and most progresive while very listenable and well-developed as they always have been but since they are probably all in their fifties they still rock nonetheless . My favorite tracks are Runaway and Ashes to Ashes as they remind me most of the aforementioned early '80s disc . All of the original members are here with Ian -LRB- guitar -RRB- Chricton taking center stage on most of the tracks . He seems to have gotten some lessons from Steve Morse or Al di Meola since Full Circle . Steve Negus ' drumming seems unimpressive albeit steady as I do miss the electronic drums from Worlds and Heads or Tales ; OK , so I am lost in the '80s . Even if you are a marginal fan , this is a must-have as this band is one of the more listenable prog . bands to have ever come out . I do n't get tired of listening to it . I guess we can learn something from the Germans who appreciate a good Canadian band , eh ? Oh yeah , and what 's the deal with the cover ?
 Not since , `` Security Of Illusion '' has Saga come up with creative and `` new '' material . With the full complement of bandmates back together again , this one puts `` Pleasure And Pain '' at the bottom of the list . While I am sure it will not get much radio play here in the States , it is refreshing to see they still have their creativity . Now , coupled with Yes ' `` Magnification , '' I am glad to see the progressive genre still strong in an otherwise dull music industry . Long live progressive and electronic music !
 This is an excellent effort by Saga . I think Only Human is the best rack on the cd and seems like it has hit potential . Money Talks is the one they did the video for and is hitable as is always there . I think parts of this cd are more commercial than Full Circle in some points but still has that late 70 's and early 80 's progressive rock style flavored in the cd . The chapters are excellent while not being carbon copies of old chapters . I think I like we 'll meet again the best of the two chapters . The only song I do n't like too well is That 's How we Like it but the the other 10 tracks are really excellent and welcome new material
 This is one of their best works . I have most everything they have done and song for song this album ROCKS . Want to get your feet wet and try Saga for the first time ? Start here .
 After a long string of pretty good but not great albums , SAGA 's FULL CIRCLE was a return to greatness.They pick up right where they left off with HOUSE OF CARDS.Michael Sadler 's intense vocals are great on the lead off single MONEY TALKS.ASHES TO ASHES is what SAGA is best known for . . dramatic vocals , guitar , and keyboard playing.Ian Crichton is one of the worlds most amazing guitarists , THAT 's HOW WE LIKE IT ! may just be his best playing yet.WE 'LL MEET AGAIN is also a highlight with another terrific Sadler vocal.Like FULL CIRCLE , there are no weak points on HOUSE OF CARDS.This band is on a roll .
 First let me say that this is the best of the most recent Saga cds . It 's got something for everyone . If you enjoy the ` Prog ' sounding Saga - it 's here . And if you enjoy the ` Pop ' Saga it 's here . Very good mix of both.Some here will say this is a good follow-up to Full Circle . I say this is way better . Full Circle does not have the stand out tracks this cd has . If you are wondering what Saga sounds like and would like to get one of their more recent cds get this one.My favorite tracks are Money Talks , Always There and Only Human . But a strong cd overall . Only song I am not fond of is Ashes to Ashes.If you do n't have any Saga music I would recommend this of their newer cds but Worlds Apart is their best bar none .

Victory Road and The Walls of Jericho are the most memorable . If you are n't familiar with the Blackwood Brothers ' version of The Old Country Church beside which this rendition pales , you will find this an excellent cut .
 If you love J.D. like I do you must have this one . I really enjoy listening to J.D. 's deep voice . There is no way I could choose my favorite song , there are just too many and I loved them all .
 The music on this album is great , I really like it . The guys are really strong Christians . -LRB- i 've met them in person -RRB- !!!! I would recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys listening to good christian music !! thanks
 I was born in 1983 , so I never had any real insight on how influencial the Sex Pistols really were until I saw this film . Britan in the late 1970s was a grim place ; unemployment , IRA bombs , recession , depression.These were the reasons why punk had to happen . The first truly great Pistols movie -LRB- after the disapointing Great Rock 'N' Roll and Sid & Nancy -RRB- . Excellent retropective interviews with the four surviving Pistols , a dazzling array of clips and concert footage and , best of all , previously unseen interview footage with the late Sid Vicious , who proves to be surprisingly articulate and intelligent.You ca n't help but feel touched when John Lydon sheds a tear for his deceased friend . An exhilerating , funny , tragic and insightful documentary.A must see .
 No , `` The Filth And The Fury '' is not a concert movie , unfortunetely . What I wanted to see -LRB- and hear -RRB- were some of their rare live performances , but what I got was the album versions of their songs slapped on top of live footage -- at least the music was remastered -LRB- it was done at Johnny Rotten 's command -RRB- . What I was n't ready for was the honesty . Rotten finally admits that he respects Glen Matlock , and he even cries over the loss of Sid Vicious . The best part is the Sid Vicious interview which sheds much of the bogus rock n ' roll myths that surrounds him . It 's good to see that he was n't as stupid as we all think , but rather a human being possibly victimized by the industry . `` The Filth And The Fury , '' is good because you do see the human side of the band rather than the image their manager -LRB- and sometimes members of the band -RRB- had concocted .
 This is easily one of the most compelling rock-documentaries ever made . There are only a few people reviewing this -LRB- who probably hated them already -RRB- who did n't love it . The reason is simple
 I was in High school when The Pistols released Bollocks and never appreciated how important this band was to rock & roll.They were and are the standard to which every punk band is measured , no one comes close.They were not great musicians but there music had more fire andballs then any band that was around then . if you want to see what real anger is -LRB- not todays manufactured anger -RRB- get this DVDand see how real music once was .
 WARNING
 Just addressing some of the criticisms of this film and adding some analysis of my own ... 1 -RRB- Overdubbed studio tracks over live footage . Would you rather hear the studio version , or hear nothing at all ? The footage from which this documentary is culled was hardly organized or cataloged when the Pistols won it in a civil case against Malcolm McLaren . Considering the time period in which it was filmed , it was probably done with separate audio and video equipment . Even if the audio exists , it 's probably very faint . Anyway , you do get the blistering version of `` No Fun , '' and the -LRB- in-studio , on-off -RRB- of `` Road Runner/Johnny B. Goode . `` 2 -RRB- The myth of the Sex Pistols ' lack of talent . A myth , and just that . If Malcolm Mclaren wanted to say , with `` Swindle ... '' that the Pistols were talentless , then he made a mistake by including their music . The music is still incendiary , and more relevant with every passing year . Try to listen to the aforementioned set of covers without acknowledging how thoroughly the Pistols exploded rock and roll -- turning rock `` standards '' into a glossalalia of destruction .3 -RRB- Too sociological in its scope . If you are used to punk as power-pop with bubblegum roots and a cartoon image , then you will probably deny the sociological roots of British punk culture . Watch the film again . The social climate was as relevant to the Sex Pistols as guitar , vox , bass , or drums.This is , to pay Temple a great compliment , a movie worthy of its subject . While I ca n't wave the banner of objective truth as the Pistols do in their modern-day interviews -- I was n't there and `` truth '' is a slippery concept -- `` The Filth and the Fury '' is the kind of documentary that rescues its subjects from the cesspool of myth.Myth is just gossip grown old .
 Forget Julien Temple 's `` The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle , '' his previous Pistols film . That was almost purely fiction , created solely as an ego-stroke for Malcolm McLaren . This is the real story , told by the members themselves , using archival footage and new interviews . More than simply presenting the what 's and where 's , it also delves into the question of WHY punk rock became the phenomenom it did in mid-Seventies Britain . This is an absolute must-see film for anyone interested in the history of rock music . From the live footage of the Pistols wreaking havoc onstage , to the the genuine emotion displyed by John Lydon when discussing the heroin addiction and death of friend and bandmate Sid Vicious , this movie is simply incredible . I 've watched it at home dozens of times and it never gets old . Very highly recommended .
 This is an unusually straightforward look at the brief history of the Sex Pistols , and a refreshing change of pace from the disappointing `` The Great Rock 'n Roll Swindle '' . Finally , Sex Pistols fans can learn what happened , rather than being subjected to Malcolm McLaren 's absurd farce and narcissistic mockumentary.Somehow , though , after watching this , I felt that something was missing , possibly because they do n't explore the music enough . It feels as though they made a documentary about Band X -- it feels generic , and lacks the sharp edge that made the Sex Pistols brilliant.In spite of that feeling , I can still recommend it any any Pistols fan .
 `` There are somethings that are just meant to happen , and the Sex Pistols just should have . '' - John Lydon.I didnt really know what to expect when I first watched this . But the result was something I never would have expected . Not only is this one of the greatest rock 'n' roll documentarys ever , this is one of my favourite films of all time . It is perfectly structured and edited , the amount of research that went into this film is amazing , and the feeling that it leaves you with after watching it is something nothing else has ever done for me , before or since . Julien Temple certainly can direct . `` I think the Sex Pistols are the antithesis of humankind . The whole world will be better off for their non-existence '' - Bernard Brook Partridge.The film starts by giving us a quick background of each of the four members of the band , where they grew up and what their childhood was like . It then goes on to explain how they each got to being in the same band . Then we get 26 months squeezed into one and a half hours , the rest of the Pistols career , and everything upto Sid 's death is included . The films packs a suprising amount of information into it 's time span , not much is missed out , and certainly nothing is censored . `` Malcolms full of sh*t , he 's convinced everyone he 's full of sh*t but the sh*t he says . '' - Steve Jones.It is narrated by the surviving members , Malcolm McLaren , and various other music industry people from past and present interviews . And unlike ` The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle ' , this is the truth told by the band members . The majority of the footage is old , taken from archives of the Sex Pistols era . This plays a large hand in making the film the level that it is . It sets the mood of London in the late 70 's , and doesnt let up , the only faces you see are those of people in the 70 's . All the interview footage has their face in shadows . This was an excellent idea . `` They said I should just do what I want , and just f*ck everyone else , you know , just f*ck 'em . '' - A fan.Near the conclusion of the film there is quite a nice collection of footage from their last show ever , in America . It shows pretty much all of ` No Fun ' , their encore performance , and you can see they are in no shape to be playing together . They then leave the stage , and John says his infamous line , `` Every get the feeling youve been cheated ? Goodnight . '' `` It ended at the right time , for all the wrong reasons . '' - John Lydon.After going into Sid and Nancy 's deaths , the film builds to a brilliant climax , with great quotes from all the members , then finishes off with a line of John 's wisdom , a line that everyone should hear . This is one of the most moving conclusions to a film I 've ever experienced . `` Put simply , the best film about music ever made '' - Time Out.This is THE film , about THE band .
 I came of age with the Sex Pistols -LRB- I was 17 in 1977 -RRB- . I can remember being inspired by their music , but I never got to really know the motivation behind the punk movement . This documentary clarified it for me.Certainly I would n't want to live the lives of the Sex Pistols ... but the extremes of their life were like a never-ending machine gun spray against the plaisanteries that the bourgeois use to lie to themselves and others ... how polite gentleman screw over everybody and still remain the `` bedrock of the community '' . SP saw through all of this and offended the status quo with their authentic rage.Someone comments that the Sex Pistols ended at the right time for all the wrong reasons . I think that is an apt statement . Noone could carry on that type of intensity for a longer period and it seems as though the group was on the verge of being coopted for a number of reasons ... seems like the heroin had a lot to do with this . Of course , it 's also true that consumer society manages to coopt everything ... even though SPs rage and nihilism made it really difficult to do.Thomas Seay
 To many lies about the band prompted the full bleesing of Julian Temple , The Filth and the Fury . All surviving band memebers are interviewed with there faces blackened out as Temple takes the viewer through 1977 London , which at the time was a chaotic state . Through the squaller of London the Sex Pistols were born . Johnny Rotten is his usual brilliantly hilarious self as he corrects all the lies that were set forth mainly by Malcolm McLaren . Lots of footage shows the band on stage as well as in the streets . You get a clear picture on how pathetic a junkies life is in seeing Sid Vicious literally waste away right in front of you . Really sad . Lots of great moments for the band are in here as well . Like the Grundy interview and the Queens Jubilee boat ride . A definte must own for any Pistols fan . The best rock documnetary I ever seen .
 Filth and the Fury is a great documentary from director Julian Temple on the Sex Pistol 's . Film shows how the Pistol 's became England 's public enemy # 1 in 1976 and 1977 by shaking up the status quo.They went against the grain and took no prisoners . The main speaker is Johnny Rotten , and he gives his version of the story , which sounds a lot better than their manager , Mclaren.Has a great interview with Sid in 1978 , a year before his death , he seems quite lively and funny , and it 's quite sad that he died at 21 . Overall a great flick .
 This documentary shows footage of the Sex Pistols back in the day.They interview all the members of S.P although all the members are hidden in the shadows.I thought that was bizzare . But the documentay itself is great.Anybody who is interested in Sid especially should view this.This shows the true side of Sid Vicious.Yeah so does Sid and Nancy but this shows the real Sid in his drugged up , drunkin , cut up self.Viewers can also see how bad it got at some of the Sex Pistols shows.They inspire me becasue two record companies tore their contracts due to their nasty atitudes and bad habits.Instead of giving up on trying to release Never Mind the Bollocks , they kept going no matter what.They had a `` nice '' little reputation going on for them in the press.But hey , that 's just them.And we must drop down on our hands and knees and thank God for the Sex Pistols and their bad attitudes.Because if they had n't acted the way they did , Never Mind the Bollocks would be a whole different record . `` Hello EMI!GOOD BYE !!!!!!!!!!!!!! ''
 This DVD is fine , the quality is a bit grainy and I would have enjoyed more extras , but it 's fine.The `` documentary '' , if one can call it such , is typical `` Pistols fare '' and has become a cliche by this point . The style of `` The Great Rock & Roll Swindle '' has been replicated on the Filth and the Fury -LRB- and countless other Sex Pistols histories since -RRB- so much so that it would interesting to see someone tell the Pistol 's story straight and without all the deliberately choppy editing style like an editorial montage.I found the `` style '' of the film to be not only fairly unoriginal , but also distracting . What 's with Johnny Rotten and these clips of Sir Laurence Olivier in the role of Shakesphere 's Richard III ? I get the reference , but is n't it redundant to keep switching back & forth between Olivier 's performance and Rotten 's onstage ? I certainly thought so anyway.No telling of the Sex Pistol 's extreme history could ever possibly be dull and this film is no exception . If you do n't know the band 's history , then you really do n't know what you 're missing . Things were much wilder back then.For my money , 1978 's `` The Great Rock & Roll Swindle '' is still the best Sex Pistols film available ... indeed it is a work of art in its own right , apart from just its subject matter . I would recommend that film instead and also make a plea for someone/anyone to please reissue it on DVD soon .
 This is an outstanding film , even if you happen to hate the music . John Lydon 's narrative is full of wit , wisdom , humor and pathos , and the pacing of the film is outstanding . I particularly like it where someone will recite a Pistols ' myth , and then Lydon will set the record straight with something much more mundane . Also , I did n't know the music was dubbed over the film until I read a review , so do n't even worry about that , it works fine . Oh yes , the music is great by the way . There was a reason for the Pistols popularity besides social history .
 The Filth and The Fury is a must have for any true Rock 'n' Roll fan ! The film charts the meteoric rise and fall of the Sex Pistols . You get the story straight from the band who , tell the truth and pull no punches . The film includes many rare performance clips and interviews . Although the band only lasted a mere 26 months , the film proves that the Pistols ' music is just as relevant today as it was in 1977 -LRB- maybe more so ! -RRB- . If you 're a Pistols fan , buy this DVD ! If you 're not a fan , buy this DVD -LRB- you 'll become one !! -RRB- .
 Of all documentaries i 've ever seen about rock n ' roll bands this is a must see . It 's brilliant , it 's perfectly planned and it tells things as they were . It shows the Sex Pistols and their music in a whole different way .
 Somewhere in a Snow-White-and-the-Seven-Dwarfs suburbs a soccer mom just unloaded her brood for the match after the Soccer-mom 7-3 shift at the office and now has to go home help the digital-literate Nascar dad with the dinner and hope that the kids are home and the plates are in the dishwasher in time for American Idull , only to find a friend of a friend 's copy of The Filth and the Fury laying about , daring you to pop it in the player and find out what rock 'n roll was meant to be about before she swoon 's to another syrup drip balladeer over-singing supper club karoake standards . Maybe it would be of interest to the aspiring American consumer stereotypes that much of Simon Cowell 's ubersnob delivery can be attributed to Pistol 's head snarler Johnny Rotten . Their curiosity peaked , they drop it in and discover the Amercian consumer 's lifestyle is under bombardment , even though the Filth 's recollecting anti- establishment and chaos in the 70 's . Remarkably , one of the instant revelatory moments in this film is how up to date the Pistols look compared to the ridiculously vomitous slabs of polyesteryear fashions their supposedly hip hosts were wearing during the old interview clips . What 's more , this is exactly what Lydon -LRB- Rotten -RRB- hates the most about the Pistols legacy
 Filthy , awful , horrible words at that . The film beautifully outlines the short history of those quintessential punk rock icons , the Sex Pistols , from their painful birth out of the English social strife in the late 1970 's , to the heights of infamy , to their on-stage self-destruction just two years later . A must-see for any alt . rock fan . The `` cut and paste '' quality of the piece might rub some the wrong way , but I feel it fits the subject matter like a glove . If you have an interest in punk rock , or in general hellrazing , you 're gon na want to see this!Favorite quotes : `` We managed to offend all the people we were f *** ing fed up with ... '' - Johnny Rotten `` We were n't the nice boys that they thought we were . We are n't nice boys ... we were f *** ing nasty little bastards . And we still are ... '' - Sid Vicious
 They were never heartthrobs for millions of teenage girls . They were banned from performing almost anywhere in their country . Their musicianship could barely be called proficient . However , for a time , the Sex Pistols were one of the most talked-about and controversial bands in rock history . And their influence over pop culture during the late seventies , can only be compared to the Beatles ' influence in the mid - to late sixties . `` The Filth and the Fury '' is both a document of a great rock band and of a revolutionary time in our modern cultural history . No one can actually call the Sex Pistols the first punk band -LRB- there are arguments for the Damned , Ramones , even MC5 and the Stooges -RRB- ; however , they are , in my opinion , the most important punk band to come down the pike . Not because they were so controversial but because they made the adult world stand up and take notice what was going on.Julien Temple 's documentary perfectly illustrates the motivations , the main characters , and the happenings of that brief , but momentous , time in history . It is great to hear and see the band members in their own words -LRB- especially some rarely seen interviews with Sid Vicious -RRB- . However , it was unfortunate Malcolm McClaren did not and/or would not participate in any interviews ; especially because the way is he castigated and vilified by some of the band members.This film is great viewing for those who lived during and vividly remember these events ; and also great viewing for those who consider Blink 182 , Green Day , mXpX , etc. great punk bands .
 If you think your the only one who saw The Great R 'n' R Swindle and thought something was screwed up your very wrong . Your not alone ... There are mad loads of us Pistols fans still out here after 20 some odd years waiting for a movie about Sid , John , Paul and Steve that actually portrayed truth . We wanted more than fiction , we wanted to see what it was like as a Sex Pistol first hand , and who would know better than the Pistols themselves ? Thats what The Filth & the Fury was made to correct
 This movie is truly incredible . I 've been a punk fan since the day a friend handed me a cassette of the Dead Milkmen , a truly awful band from PA , but this movie just blew my mind . The Sex Pistols , along with the Ramones , have been a constant favorite of mine since age 16 , and this movie just strengthens my love of their music . after watching this , everything currently on the radio seems calculated and spineless , which of course it is ... This is required viewing for any punk , former punk , or anyone sick of what passes for rock these days .
 From formation in a fetish store in late 1975 to implosion in San Francisco in 1978 , the Sex Pistols were the Bashi-Bazouks of punk music , bringing the sound to millions of listeners . They came to embody the movement , whether as music of working class rage or songs of snotty adolescent rebellion.The members ' personalities were wildly different , fistfights were frequent and the Pistols replaced Glen Matlock , their bassist and best songwriter , with Sid Vicious , a sad heroin addict who literally could not play his instrument , in early 1977 . The band was only together for 26 months , and to paraphrase Gibbon , we should ask not why it broke up but why it lasted so long.The film 's answer , basically , is the Pistols had nowhere else to go . Guitarist Steve Jones says he hated playing guitar in early rehearsals but stuck with it because he did n't have anything else . It took Vicious ' slide in heroin addiction and manager Malcolm McLaren 's mismanagement to finally lead to the last concert , where singer Johnny Rotten said , more with weariness than contempt , `` Ever get the feeling you 've been cheated ? '' `` The Filth and the Fury '' is an enjoyable , interesting piece that puts the Pistols in the context of their times . It makes a few bold sallies toward objectivity -LRB- for the band 's reputation as a scream against the British establishment , Jones says he did n't know who the PM was and just wanted sex -RRB- but is essentially hero worship , as all rock documentaries are.That 's not necessarily a problem , but the movie strongly suggests the whole of England was against the Pistols , which not only downplays the support they had from music critics who were as sick of Emerson , Lake and Palmer as they were but suggests punk was being listened to all over the country . In reality , it had something more than a cult following , but not much ; the fear of punk gaining a broader audience drove much of the opposition documented here.Director Julien Temple , in his otherwise awful DVD commentary , points out he made `` The Great Rock N ' Roll Swindle '' in 1979 to dispel some of the hero worship the band had developed , thought it went too far and made `` Filth '' as a corrective . OK . But the movie puts the Pistols back on their pedestals , which means their influences -LRB- Alice Cooper , the Modern Lovers , the New York Dolls -RRB- and more durable bands like The Clash suffer in comparison . You 'd think punk owed everything to the Pistols after seeing this , and that ai n't the case.That said , it would take a filmmaker of rare incompetence to make the Pistols ' meteoric story boring , and Temple has gift for both narrative and humor . Rotten has one ego trip too many in his interview , but both he and the other members of the band provide new insights and details about the Pistols ' troubled life . McLaren is heard only through audio he recorded for `` Swindle , '' and it may be unfair , but the evidence does n't weigh well in his favor . You get to see footage of `` Who Killed Bambi ? '' the lousy film the Pistols did -LRB- with an appearance by Sting -RRB- and a previously unseen 1978 interview with Vicious , who speaks with a surly eloquence.It 's great storytelling about a singular moment in time . The Pistols may have an importance out of proportion to their recorded legacy , but `` Filth '' does justice to their peculiar place in music .
 The Filth and The Fury , in my opinion , was a very in-depth documentary about one of the greatest punk rock bands ever . Peering into the personalities of the members of the U.K. band , this movie would give even the most skepitcal person a whole new perspective on the Pistols . You get an inside look at what really went on within the band . There was more to them than their rude , obnoxious exteriors . In Filth , John Lydon -LRB- aka Johnny Rotten -RRB- cries over the death of Sid Vicious . For anyone who thought that all he could do was yell and spit , this film is a must-see . For anyone who was and/or still is a fan of the Sex Pistols , you should definitely check this out .
 Yes , I agree with all the others before me , a real documentary !! Finally something to watch other then the crap put out by McClaren.I loved this because it had the actually means of telling you what happened . With real interviews , even with Sid Vicious himself ! Why should anyone have to buy anyother `` documentary '' when you have John Lydon himself telling you what happened ? You have the actually televised interviews that made the pistols their `` filthy '' - selves . This tells the story from begining to end , with no bull . I see this as not only an important part of my Sex Pistols collection , but as a masterpiece . Because it tells the story from the mouth of the creators . Not the snakes . Great for all Pistols Fans and even those who want the truth .
 Take a trip back in time and watch this film . See how Johnny still grieves over Sid 's death . See the Pistols play a benfit for children . See early footage of the band.A lot of good inside information and a surprising amount of music . A must for Sex Piatols ' fans .
 Wow . The Sex Pistols ? Never heard a more perfect name for a band . Immediately conjures up all sorts of images . Then seeing photographs of the band and the environment they spawned
 The surreal documentary of the rise and fall of the punk band the Sex Pistols is a very captivating film directed by Julien Temple . The filming techniques and the multitude of clips that enhanced the documentary ranging from cuts of the bands performances , ads taken from British television shows , the beginnings of a social collapse in Britain portrayed by the garbage strike and street demonstrations tell a very empowering story.I thought it did an excellent job of giving an accurate account about the exciting , repulsive , offensive and even pitiful lives of the band members who were ostracized and hated by most of the British society . Yet it also portrayed the huge punk movement and culture they began and the people whom lived off of the rebellious vibes of their music . Music in a sense can be cult-like , and in this situation it was . Though each band member had their own personal problems besides the frequent inter-band disagreements , still a sense of a common following was founded based on revolution.Their short-lived music career was nothing more than a harsh statement about life
 If you 're in the mood for a edgy documentary , why then you 've came to the right place . The Filth and the Fury is a well-done documentary about the Sex Pistols that was put together 18 years after the demise of the band . The movie did a good job representing the Sex Pistols and all they stood for - I just wish that it would have gone more in depth on their music and history.I 've seen documentaries on bands before , but none that went in the direction that this one did . Other band documentaries that I 've seen concentrate on the band 's music and them playing their music . This one seemed to concentrate on the image of the Sex Pisols and their effect on society at the time . Of course , that was the basis of the Sex Pisols ' noteriety - their effect on culture . They were the pioneers of punk music and culture , so it was obiously going to go in that direction.Rock groups have had a huge effect on me and my life , as well as many teenagers , and so it was cool to see how youth were reacting to bands back then . Music has always had a profound effect on youth culture , and that 's made ever apparent in this movie . Music helps defines who teens and young adults are - it plays a huge role in their character development . It 's crazy and enlightening to see who was influencing some of the people in the older generation.There was numerous odd aspects about this film however , one being that the manager of the band , when being interviewed , wore a weird rubber suit that kind of freaked me out . The film being broken up by some old British Shakespearian movie was kind of wierd as well , but it was cool though.I wish there would have been sub-titles for some of the interviews because some of the interviewees ' British accents were too strong to understand what they were saying . After a while I got used to it , but nonetheless.I really like learning about bands and their history and effect on the music world or the world in general , and so I obviously liked this movie . I 've seen seriously about 40 VH1 `` Behind the Music `` s , and if you 're into that type of thing , then this movie is for you . Overall , I liked it a lot . Like I said before , it probably would have been more interesting if it went a little more in depth on their history , but that 's about the only drawback . Actually , another drawback was that it showed some nudity toward the begginning . -LRB- ... -RRB- . If you have the time - go see see this movie - it 's two hours well spent .
 Julian Temple directed this tour-de-force documentary on seminal punks The Sex Pistols . Loaded with interviews and behind the scenes footage -LRB- some never seen before -RRB- , you can see why a band that only released one album in their short career has become such an icon of modern music . Whether you care for the band or not , do not miss this one !
 Great docu on the band . With great footage of England in the 70 's . Great band footage and lot 's of great interviews . I laso reviewed the book . It 's pretty cool , but this dvd is awesome . Great insight into the whole time period of how bleak everything was . And how they came together to create something that no one realized would become the voice of the youth for a decade . Great film .
 I must preface this review by saying I 'm not a Sex Pistols `` fan '' and did not know much about them -- I wanted to do a presentation on the strange death of Nancy Spungeon and so wanted to do some research . This DVD blew me away ! I admire these men for just being honest and telling it like it is . It made me wish I had the kahunas to do the same ... they had the courage to stand up to society , authority , etc. to make their voices heard . And , at times , were just nuts . Very entertaining , interesting . Really enjoyed the flashes of 70s commercials/popular t.v. I would recommend this to anyone who has -LRB- or wishes they had -RRB- a rebellious streak or who enjoys musical and social revoution . -LRB- And , frankly , you ca n't BEAT this price -RRB-
 GREAT FILM , IF YOUR A FAN ENOUGH SAID !!!! I BOUGHT THIS OFF WALMART.COM AND I COULD N'T KEEP MY EYES OFF THIS FILM VERY ENTERTAINING !
 Almost all documentaries about popular music are schlock . This one is n't . It 's a movie about The Sex Pistols , a band from 1970s England that you may have heard of . If you have n't , they were a punk rock band that is famous mostly for being famous . Much has been written about them ; most of it apocryphal . At least half of this movie is from an earlier film entitled The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle -LRB- 1980 -RRB- . It was a campy pseudo documentary . It was terrible by design . The Filth And The Fury is a fairly straightforward documentary by comparison . It 's chock full of interviews with the surviving band members -LRB- some of which is recycled -RRB- and rare live footage . Even if you do n't like this sort of music , you may still find this film entertaining .
 Not only is this filled with excellent footage of the band , but it 's also a telling of the history and climate of the 1970s Britain at the time the band was coming up . I 've watched this countless number of times , and I get something new from it each time .
 This is a very good overview of the Sex Pistols . While it is very good , it left me wanting to know more . This should have been a two hour film to be more complete .
 `` What you 've seen in any documentary about any band before or since is how great and wonderful everything is . Its not the truth of it ; its hell , its hard , its horrible , its enjoyable to a small degree , but if you know what you 're doing it for , you 'll tolerate all that . Because the work , at the end of the day , is what matters . We managed to offend all the people we were f *** ing fed up with `` Thus intones one Johnny Rotten -LRB- aka John Lydon -RRB- over a credit sequence which emulates the opening of the legendary film version of Oliver 's `` Richard III '' - and Lydon knows of which he speaks because as the teenage front-man of `` The Sex Pistols '' , probably the singularly most reviled and misunderstood band of all time , he certainly had it harder than most.To my mind , there 's no two ways about it - `` The Sex Pistols '' are THE band that broke a fundamental law of physics by literally creating something out of the nothing of economic , social and cultural poverty that was England in the mid-seventies . And in this film , which remains probably the best music documentary ever made -LRB- and my personal favourite of all time -RRB- , you get to hear , in their own words , how they charted a notorious course from being four disparate , penniless teenagers hanging around a rubber-ware shop on the King 's Road to being banned from playing in the UK and pursued around the US by the CIA and FBI because they were considered such a threat to the establishment.Listening to Lydon , Cook , Jones , Matlock and Vicious -LRB- in absentia -RRB- recounting their tale in silhouette over a wealth of material cobbled together from the films `` DOA '' and `` The Great Rock And Rock Swindle '' , as well as hours of never before seen archive footage , gives you a devastatingly honest insight into not only the times and circumstances that formed them , but also the morass of scumbags , groupies , hangers-on and imbeciles that populate the gristle-mill of the music industry to this day.One gets the impression that Julien Temple , who previously directed the Malcolm MacLaren propaganda exercise , `` The Great Rock And Roll Swindle '' , is almost undertaking an act of atonement with this film and he wisely chooses to forego overt directorial flourishes in favour of just letting the parties involved speak for themselves.Alternately hysterically funny , genuinely touching and occasionally chilling -LRB- Vicious ' final words to camera are haunting -RRB- , as a film it is never anything less than fascinating . And as strange as it may sound , I personally find it to be one of the most energizing and positive pieces of cinema that I 've ever seen . I watch my copy regularly and would recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone despairing at the state of their lives - because if four council estate kids with nothing but a shed-load of anger -LRB- which really ` is ' an energy , when properly channeled -RRB- can change the world in their own shambolic way , then you can learn a lot from their example , whatever your age .
 Yea I recieved this D.V.D. from U.P.S. Was n't real thrilled over the shipping company , IE `` U.P.S. '' They are no good no fun !! And anyhow watched Me movie and came up with some great ideas !! Anyhow this is ... STIVAN
 To me , it is much more left to imagine than doco had shown already.A useful work as still not so much to see of this scandalously famous band grasping the fame a generation ago .
 punk rock originally had almost no impact in the usa . it was a mostly british phenomenom brought on by very difficult economic times in england . the punk band that had the biggest impact on england was the sex pistols . the sex pistols viciously attacked -LRB- with words , music and outrageous publicity stunts -RRB- their society 's traditions , morality and self image . in return they were throughly hated , physically attacked , beat up and knifed right on the streets of london . the british people hated them and wanted to kill them . all this makes for a very compelling true story . told as this flim is from the sex pistols point of view it makes their anger and resentment at their class divided society understandable and sympathetic . at the time 99.9 % of the american people had never heard of the sex pistols . their usa tour was barely mentioned in the usa press . they never played nyc -LRB- media capital of the world -RRB- . the people at the atlanta show -LRB- in the film -RRB- seemed to think that the sex pistols were some kind of glitter band . any suggestion that the sex pistols -LRB- or puck rock in general -RRB- was some kind of mighty force sweeping the country is revisionist wishfull thinking by people who were not around back then . punk rock never had much impact in america . still this story of the sex pistols is a weird , compelling slice of true life . highly recommended .
 For a documentery this movie was great ! The best I have ever seen , but get really the sex pistols were n't talk the where playing and singing to make a documentary of a band with out full length concert footage is a no no . This is a great rental but , if you are over your head crazy about the band buy the cd instead .
 If your a Pistols fan you will like it , if not you 'll be annoyed and bored with it . My brother is a huge pistols fan and loved it . I like the Pistols but wasx kind of bored with it . Pretty much watching a movie abotu the trainwreck that was the first tour and Sid Vicious . Makes you wonder if the whole thing was a staged work to get kids into the Pistols . Its amost contrived the manner why which they presented their music . And the music if you listen to it is very sleak and well crafted . The songs , in reality are very pop and the image is not . Makes you wonder .
 I found the movie a little boring at times -LRB- except for the amazing old footage of the Sex Pistols in the late 70 's era -RRB- . I thought it was a bit dramatic how when they interviewed Steve Jones , John Lydon , and Paul Cook that they would n't show their faces.Some of the things they were saying were very repetitive.If you want to know more about the Sex Pistols , I would suggest watching this movie.It corresponds very well to John Lydon 's `` Rotten : No Irish , No Blacks , No Dogs '' .
 ... to pull out all my old Pistols LPs and remember how fun they are to listen to.This movie almost seemed to zip by too fast , but then , so did the Sex Pistols . Come to think of it , the last 20 years -LRB- when I first started listening to them in junior high and chopped my hair off into a spike -RRB- also zipped by pretty fast ... they put all the best songs , the best performances in here , along with some rare footage.Sex Pistols fans may have already seen the interview with a nodded-out Sid Vicious and sleazy girlfriend Nancy Spungen -LRB- who makes Courtney Love on one of her bad days look like Grace Kelly in comparison -RRB- trying to wake him up for the camera as he snores -LRB- `` Sid , wake up ... they 're tryin ' ta interview ya ... '' -RRB- . But what no fans may not have seen is a short , heartbreaking clip of an interview with Vicious after he is out on bail after being arrested for her murder . When the interviewer thoughtlessly asks him if he 's ` having fun right now ' -LRB- what was that reporter thinking ? the kid looks completely miserable -RRB- , Vicious just chuckles bitterly and asks him , `` Are you kidding ? No , I 'm not having any fun , at all . '' When the interviewer asks him where he wishes he was right now , Vicious ' quiet , calm answer to the question is so chilling and heartfelt that it made every hair on my body stand on end . In a scene shortly after , John Lydon talks about Sid getting his aforementioned wish , and for a minute you think that in the voice over he is laughing , because as a rule you do n't see John Lydon displaying any other emotion other than general crankiness . Then you suddenly , shockingly realize he 's actually in genuine tears over his dead boyhood friend.But you can also see the fun the Sex Pistols had while it lasted-especially memorable during a retelling of how they played a children 's party -LRB- still not sure what the story behind this was , or what the people who organized it were thinking , but it was a stroke of genius -RRB- , with footage of them covered in cake after they start a food fight , to one of the Pistol 's best songs -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- , `` Bodies '' . What struck me is how the Sex Pistols -LRB- who , at the time , were not far out of their teens themselves -RRB- look and act about the same age as the kids at the party . They are obviously having just as much fun as the kids , too - they try to look like tough punk rockers but ca n't wipe the smiles off their faces as they joyfully have a ball.The soundtrack , timing , and editing are all perfect . `` Submission '' , another of my favorite songs -LRB- and in my opinion , one of their more underrated ones -RRB- is played over the credits , and it fits perfectly . As I said , my one complaint that was it zipped by too fast , but talking with my husband after the movie , so did the Sex Pistols . One of the better rock documentaries I 've seen . A must see for Sex Pistols fans .
 In a day and age awash with formulaic drivel from boy bands , Britney , Madonna , Kid Rock , etc. , this film is a breath of pure fresh rock n roll air . A must for any devotee of the band . The movie contains incredible live performance footage and fascinating interviews with the surviving members of the band . John Lydon emerges as an erudite , sensitive , creative , and deep thinking punk rock pioneer , but above all a sincerely motivated social critic . Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen in the flesh here have the effect of rendering the Alex Cox 's `` Sid and Nancy '' obsolete . What this documentary primarliy impressed upon me me was the strong political streak that runs through the Sex Pistol 's work . And on top of it all , it ROCKS .
 This documentary of the Sex Pistols give you a good idea of who these guys are , where they came from , and what they were all about . Many clips from British television , animation and pictures and film footage of the Sex Pistols are used here to tell the story of the birth , rise , and crucifixion of the most notorious rock band in music history . Along with great commentaries by the surviving band members . All of them always , seperately , in silhouette during their commentaries.You come away with a deeper understanding of the Sex Pistols after watching this DVD . There are insights given here that some fans may not have known about . People saw the band fall apart but this film shows HOW they fell apart and why . They were a band who came out of the dulldrams of British life during the 70 's and rose to fame during the birth of punk but in the end of their career may have been exploited as controversial freaks and not a serious band . The band sensed it and broke up . Appropriately , the last song played at their final concert was called `` No Fun '' . You see the punk rock scene in 1970 's England , you see the Bill Grundy interview that gave birth to the bands notorious reputation . And you get Jones ' and Rotten 's take on the Grundy interview as the clip played . You see the band singing `` No Fun '' at their last concert in San Francisco and expressing their feelings and insight toward their demise and their regrets through voice overs during the concert clip . You see the demise of Sid Vicious , the sad picture painted of him and Nancy Spurgen , and you see the chilling interview of Sid that showed the unstable state of mind he was in during his pending trial of Nancy 's murder . Johnny Rotten , emotionally , expresses his regrets for not helping Sid more and not preventing his death in some way . It is surprising to hear the emotion from Rotten because he is a guy who you never see express sadness and show tears . Its a rare and real moment captured on tape.As the film goes along you become more captivated by this unique documentary . It captivates you as it goes along because its very insightful to the feelings of the band members and their manager Malcolm and they 're all very giving with their insights and feelings . This is a revealing documentary in its abstract approach to telling the story of the Sex Pistols.The DVD comes with the widescreen version , feature length commentary by director Julien Temple , a documentary on the punk movement , trailer , and DVD-ROM links to the original theatrical website . This is a must have for Sex Pistol and punk rock fanatics .
 The Filth and The Fury is an exemplary film about an significant period in British history - the late 1970 's . It should be shown in every high school history class . Director Julien Temple gets another crack at the Sex Pistols as his subject after 1980 's `` The Great Rock n ' Roll Swindle '' , but with a new twist - humanity.This is a humourous and touching film - especially when Rotten comes to tears while speaking of Sid 's demise . Who would have thought that the closest bond in the band would be between Rotten and Vicious . The narration was by each band member in silhouette - clearly illustrating their feeling that they had all been rape victims . The `` rapist '' himself , manager Malcolm McLaren is represented by a respiring black rubber mask - the bondage that restricted the band . Juxtaposed throughout are scenes from British comedy shows from which Rotten amassed his wide range of spectacular facial expressions , and scenes from Richard The III , in which Laurence Olivier spouts lines perfectly coinciding with the Pistols ' own story . After all , they had an exceptional sense of theatrics.Though they were hygienically and linguistically foul , the racket the Pistols made was pristine and clear in its intent . Though the lyrics were snide and bleak , they were a mad celebration of youth and rebellion . The music was actually quite melodic and uplifting , probably due to bassist Glen Matlock 's love of the Beatles . The chorus of `` No Future '' was a glorious anti-national anthem , sung with exuberance and joy despite the fact that the message was a pessimistic one . The dirge-like `` We Shall Overcome '' was sung by Martin Luther King 's followers with poignant sadness , yet the Pistols ' `` No Future '' was chanted in pure hopeless reverie - against the monarchy , against youth repression , against discrimination , and against disco . Watching people in flares trodding through all the trash in London 's streets during the garbage strike , Rotten saw they were clearly missing the point ; `` Wear the garbage bag ! '' The Pistols ' punk fashion ; ripped and pinned clothing was actually created out of poverty.Whether floating down the Thames on a barge playing `` God Save The Queen '' on the day of the queen 's Silver Jubilee or performing for missile-tossing rednecks in Texas , the Pistols remained resilient and allegiant to their kamikaze mission All the energy put into banning them both in the UK and the US forcing them to play under assumed names caused more of a sensation than the harmless Pistols would have ever caused on their own.The live concert footage -LRB- overdubbed with studio tracks -RRB- is remarkable , especially a charity party the band played at for children of firemen who had lost their jobs . Rotten proclaims it one of the best times he had , being lovingly covered in cream pies by very young children as he sang , `` Mommy , I 'm not an animal '' ! Quite touching.The band 's moniker was conceived by McLaren to depict A Clockwork Orange sort of maniacal youth gang ; a pack of sexy guys brandishing weapons , but the Pistols were actually too charmingly laughable to pull off that image . The shots of the band as cheeky kids with mischievous smiles against a soundtrack of the Pistols ' dauntless anarchistic diatribes on television depicted their genuine innocence . All they really did was tell the truth , and as Rotten says , `` We declared war on England without meaning to . ''
 I rate this movie 8/10 or 4 stars . This movie is among the 1000 Best Movies on DVD by Peter Travers . It won 3 awards in 2000 as best documentary in Chicago , Sao Paolo , and the Online Film Critics Society Awards.The movie depicts the history of one of the most controversial Rock bands ever
 OK , watched the Sex Pistols documentary `` The Filth and the Fury . '' A recent flick , it came out in 2000 and interviewed the surviving members of the Pistols , though they were but silhouettes residing in the comfort of midlife homes . It 's an extraordinary documentary detailing the rise of punk and the brief life of the Sex Pistols . They played but for two years , banned , hated and vilified . The documentary ends appropriately enough during their final show with Sid Vicious in San Francisco , with Johnny Rotten sadly sneering to the audience , `` Do you ever get the feeling you 've been cheated ? `` I suppose everyone is familiar with the legend of the Sex Pistols , and if you 're not , this documentary is as good a place to start as any . What I liked about `` The Filth and the Fury '' was how accurately it detailed the conditions in England that gave rise to punk music and fashion . Americans love to claim everything as their own , and the Ramones have certainly carried that `` punk creation '' torch to their graves . But `` The Filth and the Fury '' slaps everyone back into reality . The Sex Pistols were the first , and that LP `` Never Mind the Bullocks '' echoes down through generations as crystal clear as a golden coin.After watching this documentary and listening to their album , I am amazed how contemporary the Sex Pistols are . Much of the music that followed , The Clash , The Misfits , The Circle Jerks , even U2 , feels oddly dated today , a testament of the decade of the 1980s . But place the Sex Pistols on the air , and blasting from the speakers is incredible anger and energy , as profound and timeless as `` A Clockwork Orange . '' The music has aged well , and one never blushes when listening to it.Watching the documentary , I was amazed how modern the members of the band looked , interviewed by 70s fashion victims adorned in wide lapels , offensive plaid and flared pants . These reporters , attempting to make sense , were as befuddled as JFK assassination reporters , trying to nurture terrified audiences . The sad fact , and one which is detailed in `` The Filth and the Fury , '' is that the band eventually became a freak show , the music forgotten or lost by the time they wearily limped on stage in San Francisco.The footage which haunts and terrifies , is of the Sex Pistols playing their infamous 1978 tour through the southern United States . Dallas , San Antonio , Atlanta , Memphis , long-haired crowds resembling frightened Bob Seegers . Audiences threw trash on the stage , beer bottles at Sid Vicious ' face , and yet the band played on , realizing that America was a scary place ... `` Throw what you want at me , I 'm not leaving this stage ! `` Can you imagine a band like the Sex Pistols playing here today ? They would get lynched . American music writers wax poetic about the Sex Pistols ' cruise through Texas and the south . But we see footage of the San Antonio and Dallas shows , people standing as stark as statues , terrified of what they were witnessing . The echoes of those concerts carry through to today , profound and horrifying . For the Sex Pistols to have embarked through the southern U.S. with that incredibly blatant brand of rebellion was almost suicidal . They cut a path through a dense forest of a conservative Urban Cowboy rocker wastelands . The wake splashes today.The Sex Pistols band died young , no doubt . They have but one album , and a lot of haunting film footage . But to watch them in this documentary during their prime , fiercely screaming `` Anarchy in the UK , '' `` God Save the Queen '' and `` Bodies , '' is to see the ultimate example of what the musical form known as rock represents . They scared the establishment . They freaked it out . Working class and brutal , the Sex Pistols were the revolution that crushed the flowers of Woodstock . There are no ballads in `` The Filth and the Fury . '' Just a slap reverberating across generations.This is one of the greatest rock documentaries ever made .
 this film shows exactly why the sex pistols were and still are one of the scariest , yet smartest , bands to ever exist . rare film footage shows them performing for audiences that at times do not know what to do to this new music called punk , other times they begin the punk protocol of slam dancing , spitting , etc. john lydon , mr. rotten to you , is the voice most heard here , and he tells things the way they really were -LRB- does he know any other way ? hell no -RRB- , and his candor is refreshing
 Julien Temple and The Sex Pistol 's anecdote to `` Sid & Nancy . `` The documentary `` The Filth and the Fury '' amounts to personal points of view from the band members brought forefront , with actual recorded video footage over two decades old . Johnny Rotten blasts Malcolm McClaren , Steve and Paul blast Sid 's awful bass playing skills , and everyone gangs up on Glen ... sounds like the Pistols to me!The documentary is a sociocultural and historical perspective from the band members pertaining to everything from Great Britain 's economic depression during the late 1970 's , to individual opinions on the creative stagnation of musical creativity that plagued popular music during the period . Actual video footage acts as a band diary in revealing the complex issues each fool had to deal with.The interview with Sid Vicious is absolutely classic , the live action sequences of filthy , underground dive shows with the audience hanging on for the ride capture the pure essence which seems to have been lost in this modern day arena rock period . The indigence scene will always be a means of new and more creative sounds and it seems as though after watching this movie , you may have missed out on something good.The documentary is superfluously laced with ancient clips of an English version of Richard III at the beginning of the documentary , only to taper off towards the end . The documentary is full of scenes cutting and switching to events , while back-tracking to live interviews where band members are sitting in dark rooms to hide their aged faces ... as more and more natural light fills their rooms , you begin to see the outlines of their faces . Of course there are other documentaries on the Sex Pistol that have live interviews with their current aged selves ... there is one documentary entitled `` Never Mind the Bollocks , Here 's the Sex Pistols , '' which has an up to date interview with Malcolm McClaren and the rest of the gang.With a background score almost entirely consisting of Pistol songs , excellent footage of riots in England , and the documentation of the band 's self-destruction , right along with Nancy and Sid 's self-destruction , the movie ends itself on gloomy circumstances where Mr. Rotten encourages people to see life his way.The movie is an absolutely wonderful watch , even if you never had the chance to enjoy The Sex Pistols or punk rock for the matter .
 Far superior to `` The Great Rock & Roll Swindle , '' `` The Filth and the Fury '' is a well-rounded , honest look at the history and aftermath of the most influential rock band of the last quarter of the twentieth century . -LRB- Will they be making documentaries about N'Sync or Kid Rock or Eminem or Creed in 25 years ? Please . I somehow doubt it . -RRB- This documentary is n't afraid to be honest , and the result is the utter humanization of a very misunderstood band . Johnny Rotten even sheds tears over the tragic waste that was his friend , Sid Vicious , and he is touching with his sentiment and candor.This movie is always fun , and it certainly provokes nostalgia for anyone who grew up as a punk while educating those who kept their distance.Punk may very well be quite dead , but the spirit is still alive in those who keep the faith .
 If you care at all about The Sex Pistols , I think you 'll find this film extremely entertaining . I hope this film gets them some new fans , too . I remember when I was growing up , thinking that if I were ever to hear the band , it 'd just be a bunch of noise . I could n't have been more surprised when I first heard `` God Save the Queen '' -- it 's just great rock music , that 's all . I think that this movie makes a convincing case for the band 's importance and power . They were , in the end , with all the controversy and shocked onlookers aside , just a fantastic rock band . This film gets behind that great band , lets the individual members tell the truth , intercuts the footage with some compelling images -- some sad , some hilarious , all memorable -- and lets you sit back and enjoy .
 tells the REAL story of the pistols and gives each band-member 's perspective . absolutely amazing
 Great movie good for any pistols fan . It goes into some of the background , etc. . It 's worth the money ...
 This is a great film on an interesting cultural subject -- The Sex Pistols ! I remember seeing the Sex Pistols documentary ` DOA ' in the early eighties . This was another great Sex Pistols film , but TF&F ; takes an even closer look at the Pistols.I do n't know why the decision was made to do the silhouetted interviews with the surviving Pistols , however . Were they being shy and timid ? Unlikely . . John Lydon 's sarcasm and wit are so enjoyable that we must hope he continues to never like anything or anybody in the future.Purchase the DVD and enjoy . Show the non-believers that musical integrity does/did exist and not every puff musician is a bought and sold commodity . . Can you really believe what they call ` Punk Rock '' these day ! Bollocks ! `` Thank you '' Sex Pistols !
 as a true sex pistols fan , i really enjoyed that movie when i first saw it at the movies . But , there there is one thing that could 've make it better . All the songs are pasted on the performances from Nevermind the Bollocks except a few ones . The original sound must 've been in really bad shape if Temple had to do that . But frankly , that 's all that 's negative about it , the rest is very good and any sex pistols fan with self-esteem must see this , trust me .
 if you want to know everything about the sex pistols ... i suggest you buy this video because it has everything from baby pictures to there last concert as a band together
 This was a great movie , and well worth buying . I feel as if I did n't know a whole lot about punk before I watched this movie . It 's an amazing documentary , and without it , I would n't be the Richard the III freak I am toady . Watch it , buy OR rent it , I promise you wo n't regret it .
 If you want to understand what the Sex Pistols were to British culture , how they turned the cultural paradigm on end
 Julien Temple 's The Filth and the fury is an exciting , punk filled and very interesting film about the Pistols where in which not only do they incorporate footage from they 're concerts -LRB- much never seen before -RRB- and footage from old British TV shows from the mid to late 70 's , but also includes the original 4 members of the Pistols -LRB- the version before Sid Vicious came in -RRB- in silhouette form . They each bring insight , often touching and cool to many of the Pistols most infamous moments and tragedies -LRB- including the British TV show where they were the first to say the f word and footage from they 're last painful concert in San Francisco . Sometimes the film steers of from it 's original trajectory , but when it has it 's sights set on the Pistols and it 's legacy , it shows that it 's one of the best rockumentaries in sight .
 this is the real deal , no punches are pulled , a great buy , the pistolsa the the must real band iv ' e ever seen . even if u do n't like them it is still fun to watch ... GO GET ITTTT
 Director Julien Temple should have remembered the scene in `` Almost Famous '' when Lester Bangs advises the neophyte rock journalist to `` NEVER make friends with the band ! '' Fast forward to the infamous `` crying scene '' in `` Filth And The Fury '' , where John Lydon , reminiscing about Sid Vicious , chokes back tears and says `` He 's f -- dead , JULIEN ... '' Oops ... there goes the `` fourth wall '' ! That said , this is still an entertaining wallow in the late 70 's English punk scene in all of its filth and glory . Purists will cringe over the use of crisp studio versions of songs wedded to grainy performance footage , but in a way this spin stays right in line with the whole `` rock 'n' roll swindle '' concept . The film could have explored historical perspective and musical influences a bit more , instead of `` Malcolm McLaren did this to us , M.M. did that to us '' self-pity for two hours . Reality check , Mr. Lydon
 The Pistols may not of had the most talent -LRB- or any at all ... -RRB- but this did n't stop them -LRB- helped them ? -RRB- from being the best f*cking punk band of all time . This documentory is a great look at the Sex Pistols history , even if it did leave out some interessting bits -LRB- A bit on the Ronnie Bigs episode would of been nice -RRB- . Great interviews with the band , including an old one with Sid , great footage , great soudtrack , a great buy for anyone who loves punk -LRB- I would also recommend reading Johnny Rottens autobiography ; Rotten -RRB-
 superflykai gives an excellent review below and says exactly what I would have said , if I had only gotten here first . So I wo n't try and top it.What I will say though is that this is probably my favorite film of all time . You can tell that this was a real work of love . The editing is unbelievable and is actually more of an art film than anything else . Johnny Rottens naration just pulls you in . You see how intelligent he really is . No censorship here . There are virtually endless amounts of original scenes intercut in the most thoughtful way . Great interviews with Sid Vicious and silly scenes of him walking through the High Park in London with his swastika t-shirt and black leather jacket freaking everyone out . Great live performance scenes and you see that Steve Jones plays guitar as good on stage as he did in the studio . It 's amazing to see how great they really were . There are also some heartfelt moments where Johnny feels a geat sense of sorrow about not knowing how to help Sid and he holds back the tears as he remembers how the papers exploited Sid 's death and made a joke out of it . Too much material in this film to even begin to cover it . It 's simply a great film and I highly recommend it to anyone with a mind.If you care about rock and roll as a means of social consiousness or as a way of personal liberation from all the social stupidiy , or if you ever dared rebel against authority , then this is a film for you and about you . I do n't know any other band who did what the Sex Pistols did . Everything else now seems boring to me.My only complaint is that the film left me wanting for more . I 've now seen all these great little clips of all these shows and all this chaos and I just want to see more of it . . I hope they release an updated version . I would like to see the entire Sid and Nancy interviews on a bonus disc . That would be great . I 'd like to see more live shows complete from start to finish . The bonus materials on the disc are n't that great . Not much really . Only a couple of items . . I would also recommend Johnny Rottens autobiography , `` Rotten
 Well no , I was n't at the 100 Club that night either ; I was far too young but nomatter when you got into the Pistols , this offering will be of interest to you . Documenting the rise and fall of the band , we flit from 1976 London to 1978 San Francisco in what seemed like no time.Contrasting with The Great Rock 'n Roll Swindle , this punkumentary is told by the band members -LRB- including Sid -RRB- as opposed to McLaren . It would have been nice to have heard his reaction to the way Jones , Cook and expecially Lydon tell it but I suppose they would not have participated if McLaren was involved at all.You have to look past Temple 's style of documentary
 The `` Filth and the Fury '' brings you the auto-biographic history of the Sex Pistols . It is the only movie that revisits the era in which the Pistols stormed onto the music scene , saying ... You '' to meanstream music , only to crash and burn in their visit to the United States , from the surviving band members point of view.The Sex Pistols give you everything you need to know about them in this movie . Their hatred for British society and government in the 1970s , as well as their hatred for their manager , Malcolm McLaren . It effectively displayed the effect their music had to their audience , showing the transition of style from show to show . -LRB- If you are particular squimess to fetish or baby pin piercings , do not watch this movie -RRB- . And , rather humorously , `` The Filth and the Fury '' shows what ... off meanstream society about the Pistols.Perhaps what is most memorizing about the movie is Johnny Rotten 's emotional response to the death of his good friend and bass player , Sid Vicious . It is a side of Rotten that few will ever see , and the moment would have been even greater if he was n't covered by a shadow . -LRB- All band members , in reflecting on the past , are covered with shadows -RRB- With qoutes from `` Paradise Lost '' and clips from Shakespeare productions , the director seems to think his movie is advertised to British Literature majors . Malcolm McLaren 's point of view is basicly eliminated . He is limited only to sound bites voiced over a man in a perversive leather mask . McLaren 's portrayal in the movie is both distasteful and bias.Other than these few problems , the movie is great when showing who the Pistols are and how and why they ... off England . You do not have to be a Sex Pistol fan to see this movie .
 Before i saw this film , all i knew about the Sex Pistols was what i heard from the albums Bollocks and R&R ; swindle , and some stories here and there that seem mostly exaggerated to fit them into some legendary punk rock god status.So , for me , this movie was very interesting . The thing that is most interesting about it is that it seems to document both the birth and death of the entire Punk Rock spirit as it existed in England all in 100 minutes.The whole `` story '' is told very simply and as clearly as it can be . We see a small group of people having fun and expressing themselves in new ways grow into a very large group of people who buy into the whole `` look and feel '' of the movement as a trend , and through it all , we get anecdotes about how the members of the Sex Pistols fit into the whole thing ... from their first gig to the very last . . all the way to the death of Sid.I think anyone interested in music would enjoy this movie . I do n't mind that the concert footage is overdubbed , or that the songs are interrupted with `` chatter '' as one reviewer stated . After all , that `` chatter '' is why i bought the movie in the first place . I knew i was n't buying a concert film.But , it would be very cool to have another film comprised of nothing but that concert footage uninterrupted , and without musical overdubs as a companion dvd .
 I ca n't say this is the best rock and roll documentary ever made because I could n't care less about the music of most other bands , let alone watch a happy little movie about how they became the celebrated , mediocre band they are . I can say this is a touching , hilarious , inspiring , fascinating film about some very young men , their music , their fashion and the social upheaval they caused just by saying what they believed.Julien Temple does a great job with the movie itself , giving the Pistols a strong sense of context for the American viewer , but his commentary on the DVD leaves something to be desired . Someone should have told him that this is n't an interview , but a chance for him to comment on the images in front of him .
 It 's not immediately apparent where Punk stands in historical terms . There were only a handful of great bands , the music was rarely memorable , and the whole thing -LRB- the real thing I mean , not the post-punk posing -RRB- was practically over within four years . Compared with the sixties , when the pop movement encompassed a revolution in sexual habits , drug-taking , fashion , music , film , civil rights , concepts of individuality and community , and even took on and managed to end a major war , it looks like Punk was just one of a number of notable ripples -LRB- another being Red Brigades-style terrorism -RRB- which extended outwards after 1969 . But ripple or not , it had a bigger cultural impact than anything else on my teenage years
 I 'm not going to write 10 paragraghs . I will keep it short/sweet . This movie was beautiful ... . every Sex Pistols fan under the sun will LOVE it . These guys had hearts as big as their cheeky senses of humour . And that 's where they all fooled us . The music speaks for itself -- and one forgets how much you loved it . Sid and his GF Nancy ... were so much more pathetic/tragic than Gary Oldman and Chloe Webb 's version EVER portrayed . And it makes you WISH the Pistols had stayed the Pistols . And that the movie would never end !!!
 Rarely have I viewed such an honestly documented interview with any band available on video . The Sex Pistols ' singer , Johnny Rotten -LRB- now Lydon -RRB- is well known for his notorious intolerance of the music establishment , the class system and authority in general -LRB- with perhaps , a little more emphasis on the British monarchy -RRB- . He 's in his 50 's now , and I was very interested , almost startled , to listen to his views on music , the hypocrisy of the media , and his deeply loyal friendship to Sid Vicious , which was expressed in a rare expression of emotion . He has since become a television personality , appearing on talk shows and at media events in both the United States and the UK . I found him especially witty and fiercly truthful , which was a standout in this film for me , as I 'm just not used to such soulful honesty in what has become a music industry cesspool of spoiled brats , addicts , and sexually confused `` popstars '' . Lydon calls it like it is , and I really admired everything he had to say . The other high point of the film is the unusually large amount of footage attributed to Sid Vicious . We see him `` smacked up '' most of the time , but there are several spots -LRB- with his crazy girlfriend noticably absent -RRB- when he lucidly explains his own frustrations up to the point in time he was being interviewed . All but Sid are hidden in the shadows of strategically positioned studio lighting , which aids in giving the surviving members a sense of immortality , yet raising up their fallen band mate out of the shadows for all to clearly see in living color , and most of the time , it ai n't pretty . There are important video clips of the performers during the punk madness of their heydey in the late ' 70 's that I 've not seen before , and this was really special for me . I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys the historical relevance of documentaries , such as this one , where a point in time is stopped for all to see - sometimes not glorious or flattering - yet , at other times , soulful and honest . Listening to a more mature group of Pistols ; especially the witty articulation of Lydon 's anecdotes and recollections , makes for an immensely enjoyable and interesting look into the souls of this seminal punk rock band .
 Combining footage of the Pistols ' legendarily ferocious and chaotic performances with revealing new interviews , this exhilarating postmortem on one of the more offensive bands in rock history picks up where Temple 's own unfinished `` The Great Rock ' n ` Roll Swindle '' left off . Hearing Lydon , Cook , and Jones revisit a tumultuous time in their obnoxious young lives -- and then seeing the real deal in TV interviews and concert tapes -- is worth half the admission . But there are also rare on-camera conversations with doomed bassist Sid Vicious and snotty manipulator McLaren to round out the picture . Caustic , funny , and hard for any rock music fan to ignore .
 This is a great story of strange time for a band that changed a lot of things in rock & roll . This is the story in their own words with some great footage before everyone had video cameras and the internet . If you liked the Pistols and want a raw story and the history of the band , this is THE one to have .
 I am a Sex Pistols fan , I have enjoyed watching this video . You can see Sid Vicous and Nancy Spungen , how they were really like . I think they should have talk more about them but the tape is very good , interesting .
 `` The Filth and the Fury '' is not just a great rockumentary it is a great document of the social upheaval that occurred during the heyday of the Sex Pistols . The decay that was occuring in Britain in the mid 1970 's mirrored that of the established music industry i.e. Rod Stewart , etc. . There was anger fomenting among the masses and the Sex Pistols were the response to that . Aside from great concert footage on hand here , there are great interviews with the surviving members of the band . Rotten , Jones , Cook , Matlock let it be known that they were not mere puppets of the machinations of manager Malcolm McLaren that they had a voice in the message that they were conveying . The film is also an effective diatribe against drug addiction by relating the sad fate of late bassist Sid Vicious , a naive youth who was unprepared for the pitfalls of fame and it 's inherent temptations . Definitely avoid Alex Cox 's `` Sid and Nancy '' , a glamorized depiction of Sid 's downfall . If you 're not interested in the history , the music on hand is still good .
 An awsome documentary . The special features are all right but nothing to get giddy about . The film puts the Pistols in the context of thier times . There was a time when Super Tramp and Styx were considered rock 'n' roll . England was in ruins and the Pistols were pissed . Angry young men making desperate music that touched everyone within earshot . The Grundy interview is shown , the Queen 's Jubilee boat ride , and some cartoons from the Rock 'n' Roll Swindle . An absolute must for any Pistols fan and a good choice for anyone who likes solid documentaries and wants to know more about a time of economic unstability and overt social anger .
 this dvd tells you the whole story of the sex pistols
 A great movie that captured the Sex Pistols brief career well . It captured all the strife and turmoil within the band very well , with interviews of the band members that showed how each member really felt . The movie showed the Sex Pistols rise and the Sex Pistols fall , which was brought on by their manager and their disastrous U.S. tour . Anyway , the movie was definately entertaining and the concert footage was great . The movie told the real story of the Sex Pistols well and showed what a crook Malcolm McLaren -LRB- their manager -RRB- really was . It showed how the Sex Pistols were destroyed by greed and the very things that they were rebelling against . A must see for any rock fan !
 The true story of Englands loudest band the Sex Pistols . Through interviews and raw concert footage the story of the Sex Pistols is told by the band members and the people who were there . I think any big Sex Pistols fan would not be disappointed by this film . Even if your not a fan I 'm sure you 'll like this film . To see the rise and fall of the Pistols was very cool to see . The thing that I did not like the film was that the Ramones and the Clash were not mentioned . The Ramones started the whole sound , and the clash and the pistols were like brothers . It all just seemed very odd to me . What I also did n't like with this DVD was the lack of features . You only have the trailer , director commentary and the documentary of the whole punk movement , which all that I thought was good but I just thought they should 've added more interviews or more footage of shows , tv stuff , etc. . If your a fan or not , this is for you .
 `` Three Minute Hurcules '' is a vocal pop excursion into the world of XTC , Squeeze , Super Deluxe , and even the Beach Boys . These are hook-and-harmony laden tunes . `` What You See '' has very raw -LRB- Peter Buck produced -RRB- guitars . Tube top amplifiers are used throughout -LRB- hence the name , and the warm analog sound . -RRB- Analog sound also shines in `` M.I.A , '' for which a Roland Juno 6 was used . A lot of the songs are about relationship mishaps .
 Anyone familiar with the genre of English punk will instantly recognize this album as a classic . The 4-Skins more or less defined English Oi ! music during the 1980 's . The tracks contained on `` Clockwork Skinhead '' are rough and tumble , hard-hitting and uncompromising . It 's pure punk at it 's best . The tracks drip with the frustration and anger of England 's white working class.This album will not be for everyone . It 's certainly not politically correct , and persons who favour mainstream music will definitely be turned off by the straightforward lyrics . The fact that The Last Resort were an unashamedly Skinhead band , will ensure this release never gets MTV play . `` Clockwork Skinhead '' takes you on a musical journey into the slums and housing estates of London . Some of the themes that run through this album would be
 This 16 track cd is one of the 4skins best ! Enthused by the clockwork orange , every song is great -LRB- Could be compared to such talents as Major Accident , Cock Sparrer and Sham69 -RRB- . In the late seventies/early eighties the working class youth needed their own music , something to relate to on sex , ultra violence and living life as football hooligans , and the 4skins answered ! If you are a fan of Oi ! or street punk , this album WILL NOT disappoint you . If you are not a big fan of street punk and Oi ! -LRB- Or you are just curious having never heard this music -RRB- , Live on the wild side and buy it !
 All The Otis Rush tracks are different from his Cobra releases . Great CD . However , get the U.S. version .
 This album is great if you take it for what it is . Simple short to the point blues . Great lyrics by Albert , Otis , Wolf , and Dixon . So Many Roads is easily the best track . But becareful if you 're wanting to buy a guitar album . Yeah these two are pure guitar genius however there really is n't any guitar heroics on here . Great guitar but nothing like what they can do . Really Restrained man . But there are classics like So close and All your love - California and Wo n't Be hangin ' around . My biggest and only real complaint is that there is only 14 songs on here - not even quite 40 minutes of work - I could listen to this great singing and writing for hours and not get bored . This is about as musical as alot of late 50 's early 60 's blues music got but the emotion is all there even in it 's most simple musical parts . You ca n't go wrong with this album . Trust me . It really is a no brainer . I 'm so glad I found this album , now if I could just find an American release of Born Under a Bad Sign !
 If you did n't know any better , you would think that an album credited to `` Albert King & Otis Rush '' is some sort of collaboration between the two left-handed blues guitarists.It 's not , though . `` Door To Door '' is merely a collection of the few singles that King and Rush recorded during their short tenure with the Chess brothers in Chicago.It 's still a good album , however , and I suppose this way of re-issuing King 's eight and Rush 's six singles is better than putting out two seperate CDs.Albert King , the older of the two men , does a great T-Bone Walker on `` Bad Luck '' -LRB- excellent piano playing on that one , courtesy of `` Little '' Johnny Jones -RRB- , and `` Wo n't Be Hangin ' Around '' is one of his greatest slow blues.King also shines on the soulful , saxophone-driven `` Searchin ' For A Woman '' , and he does a very credible `` Howlin ' For My Darling '' -LRB- originally written for Howlin ' Wolf -RRB- . You should note that three of the six Otis Rush numbers are remakes of songs that he cut just a couple of years earlier with Cobra Records -LRB- not that they 're not great -RRB- , but this 1960 session also produced the original version of one of his best songs , the smouldering `` So Many Roads , So Many Trains '' , which features what must be one of the greatest slow blues guitar solo of all time , as well as soulful blues piano playing by Lafayette Leake . -LRB- `` Oddie '' Payne is credited as Rush 's drummer . It 's `` Odie '' . Like the dog ! -RRB- This is not an essential purchase perhaps -LRB- all the best songs can be found on other albums -RRB- , but it is a very enjoyable collection of the few songs that these two excellent guitar players cut for the biggest blues label in town , and the quality of the material is high all the way through .
 Most of us who lived in the Blues revival of the 1960s remember this landmark recording . The Blues was coming back and Chess Records , the original home of Chicago Blues , wanted their fair share of it ! These recordings were in the Chess vault for ten years are would not have been released had it not been for the success of Albert King at Stax Records in Memphis.King had recorded his set for this LP in East St. Louis and used them as a demo for Chess . They were n't really interested . Otis Rush , who has had the worst luck of any Bluesman with record deals , had come out of favour with no follow up to his massive hit `` I Ca n't Quit You Baby '' on Cobra Records . The label had gone under due the the underworld dealings of its owner . So he was looking around too.The result was this landmark record . Two left-handed guitarists on one record ! Albert King sounds as raw and basic as you will ever hear him . His tunes -LRB- maybe due to Jimmy Reed 's influence -RRB- do n't match the titles . I think that 's cool . For example `` Wild Woman '' , a template for `` Crosscut Saw '' never mentions the title ; `` Looking For A Woman '' never explains what it is about - but its a Blind Lemon Jefferson takeoff on `` Matchbox Blues '' that King did right up until his death and the most famous tune on this CD ; `` Wo n't Be Hangin Round '' , is the first recorded version of his most famous lick
 Imported CD 's available at amazon.com are often Japanese versions featuring bonus tracks available only in Japan . The album info at this site does n't specify which country the version they 're selling has been imported from . I have the Japanese one , though , and in this case there are no bonus tracks . So unless you need the liner notes in Japanese , go with the domestic version.Door To Door is a great album , but I took off one star because if you 're an Otis Rush fan , chances are you already have all these tracks on one of the several versions of his 50 's Cobra sessions . This is a must for Albert King fans though . In addition to 5 tracks from ' 61 , it has his first sessions as a leader - 3 tracks recorded in ' 53 . You can hear the beginnings of his distinct style , but the overall sound is much more raw than the slick , funky Memphis soul sound of his Stax era recordings .
 There a singers and then there are SINGERS ! Can you give an album 5 stars on the basis of one cut ? `` So Many Roads '' is an absolute must ! Otis ' singing is truly stunning . Easily one of his best performances . Does the rest of the album deliver the same ? No quite , but you only get to go to heaven sometimes . Otis is one of the few who can get you there . Try it the next time you think your coming down with a cold . Twelve bucks ? No brainer .
 I first bought this record as an LP in 1970 , not really knowing what exactly I had in my hands . But I 've never been without a copy of it in 38 years now , and no matter how much music I collect every few months I find myself thinking `` Now where 's my copy of Door To Door ? '' I spent a half hour this morning looking for it because I was in that mood where nothing else was going to punch my blues ticket . Then I thought , `` I 'm gon na look at some of the reviews and see if there 's anyone else out there that loves this thing as much as I do . '' I 'm always happy to learn what you guys and gals have to say about some of my favorite recordings , and you did n't let me down . I learned about where these recordings came from and how Chess handled them , and then of course you all verified what I suspected
 You do n't ordinarily associate either Albert King or Otis Rush with Chess , and with good reason
 This -LRB- expensive -RRB- CD is a re-release of the famous Chess record that came out in the late 1960s , after Albert King became famous at Stax records . Recorded in the early sixties , this material stayed in the Chess vaults for almost ten years before its release . This `` Limited Edition '' is from Japan and has been remastered . It should be noted that currently there is also a German version of this CD a little bit cheaper . These sides include Albert 's early Parrot sides e.g. , `` Be On Your Merry Way '' and `` Murder '' which show him as a young budding guitarist . The Chess sides , which were recorded in St Louis , are raw and very interesting . `` Howling On My Darling '' and `` Wo n't Be Hangin ' Round '' are the pick of his set . King also re-records some of his early King Records tunes such as `` California '' . Otis Rush does some great stuff as well . He does new versions of a couple of his Cobra sides such as `` All Your Love '' and `` Keep On Loving Me Baby '' and some pop-blues items such as `` So Close '' . He even sings part of one tune in a mean falsetto ! The track `` So Many Roads '' is regarded as an urban blues classic , one of Chess Records greatest sides . Overall , this is an historic album . Please read my other review of this Chess re-issue -LRB- in the U.S. version -RRB- for more details on the history of this LP and its tracks . This version is a very expensive import and it would only suit very serious fans or collectors . This is probably the only time two left-handed guitarists were featured on one album !
 Door To Door is not really an `` album '' , per se , but a collection of two different sessions recorded for Chess Records in 1960 -LRB- Rush -RRB- and 1961 -LRB- King -RRB- . The sessions would n't see the light of day until 1970 , when King 's popularity blossomed enough to prompt Chess to dig into their attic and release this material . That being said , this is truly one of those hidden gems that exists in the music world . It captures both artists early in their career . It 's raw , untainted blues from two men trying to make a name for themselves.I 'll admit , I originally purchased this CD because I was an Albert King fan , and while I enjoy his stuff slightly more , Rush 's track `` So Many Roads '' is simply-stated one of the greatest blues efforts in our world ... period . It 's an unbelievable vocal effort mixed with some fine playing . Even today , there are few artists who can match Otis Rush 's soul-driven voice , and that 's never more apparent than on the six tracks he offers in this collection.As for Albert King , only five of his eight tracks are actually from the 1961 session . Three tunes -LRB- Bad Luck , Merry Way , and Murder -RRB- are from his first recording effort as a front-man , done for Parrot Records in 1953 and later purchased by Chess . They 're mislabeled , as Bad Luck is actually `` Bad Luck Blues '' and Merry Way is actually `` Be On Your Merry Way . '' Regardless , they 're still great songs . The five remaining King tunes are also tremendous , and only one of them -LRB- California -RRB- would ever be re-recorded for a different label -LRB- Bobbin & King Records - Travelin ' To California -RRB- . I especially like `` Howlin ' For My Darling , '' but there 's not a bad song in the bunch.If you have n't yet purchased this CD , my only advice is to GET IT NOW ! You will not be disappointed in the least , I promise . Also , if you enjoy Albert King 's pre-Stax days , I recommend
 Another masterpiece of blues , this album is one of that for lovers , lovers that must feels to be near the paradise ! This is sensational since the beginning until the end.It 's impossible to be passive in front of this album.Monumental , one of the bests ever released yet !
 Excellent Chicago blues that I expected to hear from Otis Rush and Al King as for the CD quality is kind of appropriate to recording style of 60 's ... price wise is wonderful .
 I think this song rocks it has great potential to be on the top of the charts when it hits the publics ears . I have seen them in concert many times and they always make me get all choked up when I hear this song .
 well i have sort of a biast opinion on them cause my uncle is the bass play but i still have to hand it to all of the members you guys rock and im sorry i missed so many of your shows but ill always be your number one fan ! - = Rob = -
 One of the unexpected surprises was to hear a CD without scratches , raps , or rediculous lyrics . The guitars on So Stay Awhile are not only technically impressive , but also have an uplifting `` get yur rocks off '' feel to them . The songs `` If U knew '' & `` Blind '' were my personal favorites .
 Great sound ! I truly enjoy listening to the CD . This band is truly going places .
 Seeing this band perform twice now , I have never been more entertained and understood at the same time . Their music seems to have been written to fit each listener individually . They have made their mark in the music scene and do not expect them to be leaving any time soon . They 'll definitely make it !!
 This CD is definatley one that everyone needs in their collection , with great melody songs , and some real up beat catchy tunes . If you are a fan of Matchbox you will love Tuesday 's Waiting . Beyond their CD is their live shows which are all around a great time . CHECK THEM OUT
 I 've been fortunate to see this band live , when I went out to see a friends band play , I was impressed and bought the CD . If you like Matchbox 20 or Goo Goo Dolls , I think you will really like this CD . They sound better live !
 one of jt 's last concerts ... bootleg filmed , but rather good , one gets used to the filmquality , if you like jt this is a historic movie , the songs are good , but it 's a bit sad , he had only 3 weeks to live when this was filmed and he was marked from his illness , he did n't have the strenght to have his guitar on for every song and walked out a few times to rest and let stevie and alison sing a few tunes ... the sound is really good as the live album add water and stir from this show ... good but sad ...
 I have seen Eddie Money nine times live in concert . Four of those times in the last year and a half . This disc represents exactly where Eddie Money is in his life . This is not his best work , but shows how good he still really is . He has definately aged , but still knows how to rock with the best of them . -LRB- The DVD of this show is just as good ! -RRB- From the opening guitar riffs of Two Tickets to Paradise , to the ending notes of -LRB- Wan na Be a -RRB- Rock and Roll Star , he can really sing his ... off . Eddie has a remarkable back-up band with him , bringing some re-newed life into some of his songs . I would definately add this disc to your collection ! Since his sales have been down , one only knows how many more Eddie Money releases we will be blessed to receive from this awesome entertainer . Also look into his catalog of other releases . He and his band are '' still '' putting out some great material , even though you do not here them on our radios.ENJOY ... it 's worth it !!!
 Great cd , good old songs . . the kick out the jams cover is a little off i found but still rocking . I actually own the original 2 american nightmare ep 's and anyone else who does probably is annoyed by the fact that they 're so damn short . . that 's why this cd is totally worth buying . for all the hardcore kids who are too lazy to change cd 's after the first farewell . . this is a good cd
 If you like ... well ... this kind of hardcore , then this is the best of it . Really . I never owned this CD , but I know all the songs -LRB- from other albums -RRB- , and they are all amazing . Worth it x 100 .
 This is a re-release with more of a glossy packaging of the early 7 '' and so forth from their original hardcore label Bridge Nine . It amazes me that even in the maturing sound of this band they stir a sense of anger and intellegence in their music . This album is great -LRB- especially interesting is the Kick Out the Jams cover -RRB- . I thoroughly enjoyed this -LRB- yes ; I said thoroughly -RRB- . This band is still one of the most innovative in the world of hardcore .
 Eventhough they are broken up . They still rock the party . This CD is a combination of old and new songs which are great . I reccoment this CD to anyone who enjoys listening to good !! music.love , Kevin
 Cibo Matto 1999 ! This is the best driving music i have ever heard ! Just listen to Sunday part 1 . I bet you 'll instantly think of driving through a huge city . Its great for parties too ! A pure and original blend of pop , techno , jazz/blues and rap makes this cd enjoyable for everyone . The tracks have a curious transition however . One songs happy and whizzy and poppy then the next is a distorted roller coaster of rhythms . Its a great experience . I would reccomend this cd to everyone because everyone i know liked it a lot when i showed them .
 This is a good album but I think they were better before they let those boys join the band .
 this album is equal parts bizarre and beautiful . this is wacky pop music at its best , with so many hairpin turns that youre dizzy at the end of it all . if youre a fan of brazilian heavy metal jazz hip hop , then pick it up . if not , loosen up and buy this album anyway .
 Cibo Matto is such a cool group . They are very original and well ... . are just out of the oridinary ! I love them so much . tracks such as ` Flowers ' , ` Spoon ' , and ` Working for Vacation ' are stellar . These two woman -LRB- Miho Hantori and Yuka Honda -RRB- have come a long way in music . One of the reasons they are great is because you ca n't classify them into a group such as pop or jazz , rock etc , etc. . So if you love life buy this CD immediately !
 This new album from the capricious and eccentric Cibo Matto will be inspiring ! I know it will . They 're trading their crazy food lyrics for crazier lyrics varying of everything .
 I love this cd , Cibo Matto kicks a $ $ . You ca n't go wrong with this one , the songs are awesome . I wish they would come down to Austin , TX . The music is fresh and funky . Digital sounds , bad a $ $ lyrics , cool horns , its just some cool a $ $ grooves ... . I also love Lenny Kravitz , Bjork , Rage Against the Machine , Eiffel 65 , ect .
 I bought this CD 1 -RRB- because I love Cibo Matto 2 -RRB- Because I am a new aged music listener my self , and 3 -RRB- Cibo Matto ` s lyrics dont have to be understandable to say what is said . The beats and techno style music I think is going to be the music people in the future are going to be listening to the most . NOT COUNTRY !
 A Japanese-born duo relocated to New York and christened with an Italian band name . Their surreal narratives sung in a combination of French and broken English may not be for those fans of J-Pop groups . I have seen this group emerge since 1994 since their first release Viva ! La Woman in 1996 ... this is when I immediately started to buy their releasing albums . We should be thankful we have an imported talent from Japan signed to Warner Bros. .
 For me , this sophmore effort from Cibo Matto is a little bit disappointing . This time around there are less food references one of the things I loved on the first lp and second this album is less wacky and hip-hop oriented with the exception of Sci-Fi Wasabi . You definitely can feel the influence of Sean Lennon on this album . It seems Cibo has gone toward the pop route , which is not good . A plus side of this album is that it demonstrates Miho 's great voice , she is way more clear and fluent on this one . Moonchild is a good example on how good Miho 's voice is . I like how Cibo is evolving their sound , but this evolution is below par , hopefully the next time around they evolve again for the better . Overall is a good album , but I like Viva better .
 I personally love Cibo Matto and i 'm only 15 years old . Just hearing about them i bought all of their albums wish they made more !!!
 This 1999 album captures the best of the 90 's lounge vibe and has really aged well . I still play it often and love hearing Sean Lennon on it . Every song is a keeper . Just pure pleasure for now people . I wish they 'd get back to gether and record again . I want THIS sexy back !
 I ca n't believe that this music is n't all over the place . These are unique songs , unlike anything on the airwaves today . It is a refeshing break from the mundane material presented to us daily on our radios . Very exciting . I never grow tired of it .
 This is a fun and vibrant cd . The songs vary from the infectious smile inducing cheesy elevator-musiclike songs -LRB- like lint of love , flowers -RRB- to beautiful and haunting ballads -LRB- moonchild -RRB- and ca n't - help-but-sing-along-with hello kitty rap -LRB- sci-fi wasabi -RRB- . Each song is a strong combination of wit and musicality . Though one can hear many vastly different influences on this cd , it 's like no other -LRB- including their debut viva ! la woman , and equally good yet completey different effort . -RRB-
 I knew CM was a great group when I heard them , but it was n't until my 9 year old cousin professed the same praise , that I realized how they can influence young ears . By providing less-cookie cutter-ish music than most other popular groups , and clever lyrics , CM is teaching youngsters that music can be interesting and still cool . I hope they put out another record soon in the spirit of Stereotype A.
 That 's what this CD has . It 's amazing how completely different each song is and how pleasing they all sound together . The lyrics are simplistic but astounding at the same time . Each song has a beautiful ambiance on it 's own . I do n't think it 's possible to listen to this CD and not want to sing along . If you 're hesitating to get it there 's absolutely no reason not to . This is a very intelligent band that can put you in the mood to move your body but also invoke thought . A must buy .
 I loved Viva La Woman , but Stereotype A has to be considered a qunatum leap forward for Cibo Matto . A lot more cohesive . They have n't lost their tendency toward the experimental , but it 's a little more contextual this time out . Fantastic ballads in `` Moonchild '' and `` Stone '' . Really well crafted songs reminiscent of some of the best of Tropicalia . Perfect for a drive down the SoCal coastline .
 Excellent ! Smart and a lot of fun . Quirky and surprising .
 I loved Viva ! La Woman very much , I thought the album had a great mood all the way through , and was very inventive . Stereotype A , on the other hand breaks away from their previous sound almost entirely . It takes a lot to do that , and with some great results . It is such a poppy album that no one can resist it . I played it for a few people in my car on day and they all went out and bought it the next day . Cibo Matto promises to be a great pioneer band if they keep experimenting ... what 's next ?
 When I first listened to this CD , I was very shocked at the new sound of my favorite band . But later , I began to appreciate the refined sound of Cibo Matto 's latest . From the girlie-rap of `` Sci-fi Wasabi , '' to the jazzy break-up ballad of `` Speechless , '' and to the hard rock `` Blue Train , '' Stereotype A is great ! The band has minimized the sample happy style and perfected the eclectic taste of `` Viva ! La Woman . ''
 Stereotype A is a break from the typical music played these days . I saw the group on PBS Studio 54 and I was impressed with their performance . Rarely am I impressed by lyrics , but I find myself playing this CD over and over again . The key word is `` nothing deep '' just fun lyrics and great music . It 's chill-out-and - have-a-martini music . My favorites `` Sci-fi Wasabi '' , not your typical rap song , and `` Spoon '' has the kind of funky grooves that make you want to jump up and dance . I 'm hoping they cut another CD soon with songs such as `` King of Silence '' and `` Moonchild '' these tracks have a mellow groove that I find intoxicating .
 This cd is really awesome ! There 's so many cool sounds here . It 's like the beastie boys-gone japanese cooking . I really love it ! It should appeal to fans of any genre !
 I just recently discovered Cibo Matto and I love BOTH CDs . Even though `` Stereotype A '' is very different from `` Viva '' , I do n't understand some of the hoopla concerning this change . Underneath their `` slickly produced album '' and `` formulaic '' styles , they are almost the same quirky , goofy band having fun and looking for a new way to mix it up . This is a great party CD with interesting lyrics and unexpected twists and turns in the style department . I respect Cibo Matto 's choice for musical evolution and encourage any fun-life-loving listener to pick this one up !
 Like a lot of people who bought this CD after having owned Viva ! La Woman for several years , I was surprised to hear the generally different style of sound on these tracks . There 's less `` edge '' to Cibo Matto than on their first album , but I think it 's more of an `` ironing out '' of the rough parts of the first recording rather than a `` toning down '' . The new tracks draw from more genres than before , and I think the blend works very well . Miho & Yuka deliberately avoided making a Viva ! Part II , and I think they 've succeeded in making an excellent new release showing off the experience and vocal/English/songwriting refinement they 've garnered over the past 3 years . -LRB- I actually listen to and like all the tracks on this one , as opposed to Viva . -RRB-
 I have been flipping through the reviews here , wondering if those who think VIVA is a superior disc are crazy ?! While a fine debut , this album is so much better . I agree that the older version of `` Spoon '' from the SUPER RELAX e.p. is better than the newly recorded version . Otherwise , I think that this disc is a blast . Tracks like `` Lint Of Love '' , `` King Of Silence '' , and `` Moonchild '' are heads and tails above anything they 've done before . I got an advance of this album back in April and I listened to it so much that I had to get another copy -- I wore it out . This album deserves your time and your dollars . BUY IT !!!
 `` Stereotype A '' is a CD that I can listen to over and over and over and not get tired of it . I 've been a cibo matto fan since Viva ! , but I 'd still say that the new CD blows the last one out of the water . They are great live now , too , with the addition of Sean Lennon and others .
 It 's a difficult country to gain respect in , America that is , for foreign musicians ... Especially those who do n't care to be recognized for their cute gimmicks or for novelty . Cibo Matto , though acclaimed for their debut Viva La Woman ! , have masterfully and elegantly avoided being artistically restrained to one idea or concept with the eclectic release Stereotype A . This record is groundbreaking for the band and is , perhaps , an affirmation of the strength of good pop music everywhere . While Viva La Woman was symbiotic in themes and musical textures , Stereotype A is all over the map stylistically and in focus . ` Working for Vacation ' is a crazy stomp through electronic breaks and middle eastern melodies , while ` Blue Train ' is a heavy metal anthem making you check your decks to see if you 're still listening to the same record . ` Sci-Fi Wasabi ' will please Cibo fans who are fond of Viva 's girlie shout-outs , and ` Spoon 's get-down-on-the - get-down funkified bassline will have even the most boring of you bobbing your heads . A great element on this album that was a bit underdeveloped on Viva is the inclusion of several ballads . ` Moonchild ' is an amazing tune showcasing Miho 's pipes better than even ` Birthday Cake ' . My favorite track is definitely the gorgeous ` Sunday part 2 ' . Lyrically and structurally , it is one of the most beautiful songs I have had the privelege to hear in a long time . Overall , Cibo Matto have established themselves as an important element in pop music and we can surely expect a great deal of amazing material in the future from them .
 Cibo Matto 's ` Stereo Type A ' is an incredible album . Yuka Honda and Miho Hatori are unafraid of exploring all genres of music while still keeping each song original and their own . Their lyrical talent shineso n the triumphant ` Speechless ' and ` Sunday Part 1 ' . ` Flowers '' and ` Llint of love ' are disguised as cheesy and cute pop-songs , but are spiked up with deep , thought - provoking lyrics . Cibo masterfully creates each song using an ecclectic mix of instruments from synthesizers to country-guitar to a slamming door . They have definitely matured since ` Viva La Woman . ' They 're less crunchy and irreverent , more polished and defined . The vocals on this album show that they are truly talented vocalist , beyond excellent singers . I recommend this album to open minded individuals who are sick of the bland , neatly categorized mainstream . Cibo Matto 's music sounds effortlessly inventive and original . This is one of the best albums of the year , if not the decade . Yuka and Miho break every stereotype imaginable with Cibo Matto . They write and produce all their own songs -LRB- with other two Cibo members , Sean Lennon , Timo Ellis -RRB- , and play their own instruments . They are ahead of their time and in a league of their own , Stereo-type A is a must in every dj 's bag .
 This was my first Cibo Matto album , and what an album it is!It 's too bad the duo split after this , because their potential had always been utilized in &uuml;ber - spiffy ways , of which this is quite a shining example indeed.In the fine tradition of `` Viva La Woman '' , Cibo Matto mix hip-hop and funky sounds all around the mix with tales of relatably mundane experience and , again , sometimes food and related appliances.Sean Lennon even appears as a guest on this album , as he was Yuka 's boyfriend for a time , but there 's no doubt that one with his talent could have done wonders for what was already amazing!From the first , amusing and breezy song , to the last , and all the rocky , rappy , latin-ish and even ballads in between , this album is like an extremely gleeful cornucopia featuring the most unusual , yet succulent fruits.Proof that the whimsical often wins out .
 Cibo Matto 's Stereo * Type A is a fantastic journey for anyone who appreciates musical originality , creativity and talent ! -LRB- I actually wanted to give it 4.5 stars , but that 's not allowed ... -RRB- Sean Lennon 's addition to the mix has definitely served as a catalyst for Miho Haturi and Yuka Honda , who have vastly improved upon the promising work shared on their first effort , Viva La Woman ! Tracks like the re-worked `` Spoon '' and `` Sci-Fi Wasabi '' are definite groove tunes , while songs like `` Moonchild '' and `` King of Silence '' are guaranteed to sweep you up in their perfect mating of instrumental and vocal stylings . Hip-Hop , soul , pop , blues -LRB- ? -RRB- ... All genres dutifully obey the commands of Mistresses Miho and Yuka . -LRB- Heck ! I even enjoyed the rock tune , `` Blue Train , '' and I am NOT a big rock fan ... -RRB- Moreover , Cibo Matto has captured the elusive blend of creativity and diversity heard on CDs like Wyclef Jean 's Carnival . If you have never purchased a CD before based on a review you 've read , please let this be your first ; you wo n't regret it . Those of us who have already joined the second world of Cibo Matto happily await you ...
 I thought that there was no way possible this CD could be any better than Viva!La Woman , but it just may be . This is an entirely different album , but it is just as great . While there is a noticeable absence of Bossa Nova samples , it is all but made for with the overall artistry of each song . My favorite tracks are the Beastie-esque `` Sci-Fi Wasabi '' -LRB- Which is better than anything the Beastie Boys have ever done -RRB- , `` Sunday Part 2 '' , `` Moonchild '' -LRB- Beautiful Song -RRB- , and my favorite of all `` Stone '' -LRB- great horn arrangement and deep lyrics -RRB- . Oh yeah , `` Blue Train '' is really great for a rock song . I like it better than anything Black Sabbath ever did . Overall , my personal # 1 favorite album . Be sure to buy it !
 it 's been more than a year since I bought this CD . when I first came here to write a review , I gave this CD 4 stars , and today , I 'm here to give it 5 stars . even now , more than a year has been passed , I never stopped listening this CD . just incredible . Speechless , Lint of love , Sunday Part I&II , Moonchild ... everysong is precious and also fun , thoughtful , unique . one of my friend said `` moonchild '' it the most disappointing song because he thought is sounds like a normal R&B song , but now , I think `` moonchild '' is one of the most thoughtful songs in the album since now I know this song is about Miho Hatori 's friend who died when s/he was young . Speechless remains as my favorite ever . the lyrics are honest and metaphors are fresh and fun . this song just makes me speechless with Miho 's unique vocal and cool rhythm . Lint of love is very powerful with all member 's collaborations . Dont forget to check out Sean Lennon 's solo vocal ! yay ! Cibo Matto !
 I do n't remember what caused me to buy the first album of this group , but I did , and I enjoyed it . It was more of a novelty though , not terribly substantial , and it never lasted on the CD player for very long . It was like eating an unusual-tasting piece of candy , but that was about it.Well , this one then came along and I let it sit in the store for several weeks until , desperate for something original , I finally picked it up , and man , am I glad I did . This is a HUGE improvement over the first album ; in fact , this is a revelation . These girls are GREAT!The first leap forward and noticable immediately is the quality of singing . They are both absolutely terrific singers , both individally and especially while singing in harmony . And not only that , but their phrasing -- the way they fit these lyrics in with the music -- is truly wonderful and just a joy to listen to . You can listen to it over and over and just marvel . For example , in the first song , Working for Vacation , the chorus is , `` Counting heartbeats , seventy-two in a minute . '' Except the way they sing it , it 's more like , sah-van-tee too in ah mini-eet . Man , I ca n't describe it , forget it , but it is unbelievably cool ! -LRB- And the drummer that kicks in there about half-way through -- overtaking and sublimating the drum machine -- is also great . -RRB- This vocal , technical skill is evident in just about all of their songs , most notably , to me , in Flowers , Moonchild , Spoon , and King of Silence . Moonchild , particularly , is amazing . It is clear that Miho Hatori , the singer , is at the top of her vocal registry , but she does n't miss a note or even quaver or anything . It is a magnificent performance . But beyond this , the two sing with a great deal of passion and to intelligent lyrics , so the experience is quite moving in other ways also . Moonchild , for example , is apparently about a person the singer knew as a kid , since passed away . `` Sometimes I feel you 're smiling at me and telling me your memories . '' This is so sweet , so touching , so beautifully sung.And Speechless . It starts off with a jazzy-bluesy bass , with syncopated , spoken lyrics , then delves into , again , a jazzy chorus , all the while picking up power , before heading into the climax
 This is the best CD I 've ever bought . I listen to it every day ! Cibo Matto provides a mix of tech . music and alternative with a modern edge . This CD deserves 5 stars because it is packed full of lyrics with meaning . You wo n't hear them on the radio , but Cibo Matto is far better than the so called music played today .
 Let 's face it
 Sometimes simple is best , so I will keep this simple . This is the grooviest album I have heard in years .
 Every track on this album is great . Every time I listen -LRB- and that 's been dozens of times -RRB- I hear something `` new . '' It 's the most creative mix of pop , hip hop , jazz , blues I 've ever heard . It 's a super mood lifter .
 I just love this c.d ! It 's just a great album overall .
 I do n't know why , but I really like Japanese music . Cibo Matto is great ! The music is great -- you want to listen to it over and over again . Definitely a CD to buy .
 I found these girls by accident . They are so unique . I also bought this for a friend who loves it as much as I do.Get ready to laugh , sing along , and dance .
 I have no doubt that many of those who loved the kooky lyrical images , occasionally strident punk influence -LRB- shrieked vocals -RRB- , and out-there avant garde-ism of VIVA ! LA WOMAN were disappointed in STEREO * TYPE A. However , it is precisely the `` sanding off '' of rough edges that make this an easier entry point for those unfamiliar with the work of Miho Hattori and Yuka Honda.The works here are unique but without being `` alien '' to more mainstream listening tastes , inviting people to `` grow into '' the music rather than throwing icewater in their faces and screaming at them to `` grow up '' . As a result , this disk probably brought more into their fanbase than the earlier effort did.The Japanese accents seem less noticeable on this one , particularly in the moments where Yuka and Miho sing in unison with each other and -LRB- at times -RRB- the guests . Only on tracks with spoken sections are the accents more `` difficult '' for Western ears . Additionally , the songs seem more like syncretic wholes ... rather than slapdash efforts to `` force '' genres together . And if the lyrics still at times are a bit unscrutable , they at least suggest interpretations more easily.HIGHLIGHTS : `` Working for Vacation '' is a quick ditty on the essential frivolity of much of our existence -LRB- `` Feeling wrong cuz the days are too long/Counting heartbeats/72 in a minute . . '' -RRB- as a go-go organ rides a techno beat . A liquid bassline motivates `` Spoon '' , a lament of lost spark in a relationship . It 's a good example of the genre-mixing as a peppy brass section beefs up the chorus and the song melds in jazzy acoustic guitar and a `` disco '' break without making it sound out of place . `` Lint of Love '' seems to be a request not to let the petty things wreck human relations -LRB- love and otherwise -RRB- . -LRB- `` We ca n't avoid the lint of love/And you 've got to know how to take it away '' -RRB- The tune manages to work in heavy metal references , more brass , a rap bridge , and some funky clavinet work courtesy of John Medeski . `` Moonchild '' is as dreamy as its outer-space theme might suggest . It 's probably the most `` pop '' song here . `` King of Silence '' speaks to that indefinable `` zing '' that signals attraction between two people . -LRB- `` You are the king of silence/You do n't need one word to talk to me/All I know is we have sympathy/Close your eyes and lean your head on me '' -RRB- The peppy `` I ca n't find it/it 's been on my mind/I 've been trying to find it/day and night '' chorus make `` Sunday , Part I '' the other peak of this collection.LOWS : After the first 5 , the disc 's momentum slacks quite a bit . `` Sci-fi Wasabi '' harks back to VIVA ! with its inexplicable `` odd for odd 's sake '' imagery . -LRB- `` Obi Wan Kenobi is waiting for me in Union Square/My wheel needs repair/The bike lane 's glowing all over the city . . '' -RRB- It 's rap from the planet Neptune . `` Blue Train '' is a messy collision of Metallica-esque guitar on the verses and a punkish chorus , with a minimum of lyrics stretched out for 5 minutes . Bah.BOTTOM LINE : It feels less like screwing around with instruments and genres in the studio and more like realized songcraft . After a couple listens I found myself humming some of these and think `` Moonchild '' could have been a hit in a more perfect world . This is a `` food madness '' I could acquire the taste for .3 1/2 stars
 I loved Viva La Woman ... I saw Cibo Matto in concert the day this cd came out and was kind of bummed they did n't play stuff from Viva . The next day I bought the new album , thought it was kind of cool , but that each song sounded pretty similar and was not as interesting as I Know My Chicken , etc. . As I listened to it more , I got more and more addicted . I sometimes get panicky if I feel like listening to this album and it is n't around . Every single track is good , I especially like Lint of Love . The songs are very funny but in a Po-Mo making fun of things kind of way , but they also have a serious message to them often , as well . This album is awesome , I definitely rate it as one of my favorite albums .
 Wow is all I can say . The first I heard of them was at the lilith fair and they performed Sci-Fi Wasabi , Lint of Love , Know your Chicken and a few others . I was under the initial impression that what I was hearing off of Viva was their new stuff , so I thought they were a cool band that I enjoyed quite a bit . Then I went to buy the cd , and I got stereotype-a and listened to that in my car and was totally blown away by the incredible growth and maturity in the music as compared to Viva . Personally I really like the diversity from song to song and how each one is complex and it seems like there is always something new . I 'm not too fond of the typical NIN-esque , `` Let 's repeat the same thing for the next 8 tracks , and call it an album ! '' mentality . Repetition for the most part is evil unless used to make a point , and trust me , this album has a LOT of variation , but its done really really well , it still all flows together nicely . I 'm looking forward to seeing them live again , this time at the Coachella fest , if you have n't checked them out , DO SO NOW ! Ciao . = -RRB-
 I loved `` Viva La Woman '' as much as anyone , but a concept album about food only works once -LRB- and it did work amazingly well -RRB- , so it was with some trepidation I bought this album , fearing `` food maddness '' was a one-trick pony ... Boy was I wrong ! If anything , there are TOO MANY tricks on this disc . Hatori and Honda have grown immensely as songwriters and arrangers . They 've also teamed up with uber-hip pal Sean Lennon and made a great sophmore -LRB- major label -RRB- album that stays true to the core sound of the band while expanding its boundaries and redifining its vision . The girls seem much more in control of their elctronics this time out , too . They make brilliant use of samples and come up with some really cool beats.The real treat here are the more `` serious '' , generally slower songs . I personally love to hear english sung with a heavy accent -- I think it adds a lot of emotional power -- and the slower numbers really highlight the great singing of Hatori.The record is well produced , conceptually sound , well played , sung with real passion and conviction ... . overall a great album . I 'm looking foward to their next release !
 But not as revolutionary as the first album `` Viva La Woman . '' I bought this CD being told it was like the Beastie Boys were women . That was a lie ; but Cibo Matto is crazy like the Beastie Boys . Their music is sometimes Electronica , sometimes Alternative , sometimes just plain weird . The weird part makes sense because Shaun Lennon has an influence of this band . One track reminded me of John Lennon 's Revolution 9 in that both still give me nightmares . Number 9 , number 9 ...
 Stereotype A is an evolution from Viva in that Cibo Matto expand with every type of song structure . Rap , thrash rock , J-pop , R&B plus more are all covered . Ca n't be compared to the predecessor . When will they come out with a new album though ?
 Can an album be any more originally , entertaining , and just plain funky ? Nah , so check this one out . Miho Hatori shines over Yuka Honda 's wonderful production . Lots to check out on this album , so peep it !
 Cibo matto is great , duh , but i think that they kind of were n't so imaginative with this album . on Viva ! la woman , everything was different . the beats , the sounds , the way they used their voices . and the metaphors clearly took some thought , life experiences and food binging !! -LRB- forgive my questionable spelling -RRB- this is good old cibo , with not enough food . and yes , i know many people did n't appreciate the whole food thing . but i think it came from some very sharp , very hungry minds , that have been a little dulled by something called similarity .
 this was my first cibo matto cd , and it is absolutly amazing ! the songs are well developed , i love the many layers of sound on this album . this is the perfect album to listen to if you need a pick up !
 I did n't even know about Cibo Matto until a few months ago when a friend introduced me to them . Cibo Matto is composed of the wildly talented and innovative styles of sampling and `` technical wizardry '' of Yuka Honda and the sweet , soulful yet multi dimensional voice of Miho Hatori . Others include Duma Love and Timo Ellis on Drums and Sean Lennon on vocals and Bass . This is one of the best CD 's I have purchased this year ! Definitly a must have for your collection !
 Last week , I had my wallet pickpocketed , had a love meltdown - all while my father went in for emergency surgery . It is to Cibo Matto 's unending credit that I somehow could not get their unusual , uncategorizable album out of my head . I sang the songs constantly to myself at some very inopportune times . The spirit of `` Stereotype A '' was so tender and fun that , in spite of the fact I probably would have prefered to immerse myself in some moody heroin-induced lyric of Millennial agony , I had to be a part of it . I retained a marginally good attitude . My wallet was found and my dad is going to be okay , -LRB- I 'm still annoyed with my love interest . -RRB- and now that things are better I am absolutely wearing Stereotype A out . This is one of the most listenable and brilliant albums in years . Thank you Cibo Matto !
 OK , most of us remember and cherish Cibo Matto 's ` Viva La Woman ' . We melt for `` Birthday Cake '' , pine for `` Sugar Water '' , and get a big kick out of `` White Pepper Ice Cream '' . Well , the whole food thing is n't present on Cibo 's new album , ` Stereotype A ' . And in my humble opinion , it 's all the better for it . While ` Viva La Woman ' was an extraordinary album , I feel that ` Stereotype A ' is the next step - It is strong and pick-uppish where ` Viva ' occasionally stumbled . ` Stereotype ' definitely shows influences in hip-hop and J-pop - but it truly depends on your personal preferences of music . Me ? I 'm in heaven . My personal favorites are `` Spoon '' , `` Sci-Fi Wasabi '' , and Speechless '' .
 it is still very good , but it is not as fun to litsin to as the 1st cd was.It sounds like they are haveing more fun with abigger band though .
 I really like this album ... many others who have reviewed this album had felt that by abandoning their `` food references '' and other original and creative things inherent in Viva La Woman , Cibo Matto had regressed . Not true . Cibo mattto has evolved . If they continued with the same old thing every time they release a new album , where would their originality go ? I could see why a lot of people are dissatisfied with Cibo matto 's new sound , but just give them time to explore new avenues of creativity . It is , in fact , only their second album , no ?
 This abum is absolutley spectacular . All I have to say is that whoever doesnt like this album , just doesnt understand that this was the next step in the evolution of their sound . They 've fed their hip hop craving while stll remaining creative and original . And still , eccentric tracks like `` Mortming '' and `` Sci-Fi Wasabi '' leave a refreshing reminder of old styles . Overall , the lyrics are still great -LRB- although the novelty food references are for the most part gone -RRB- , the instrumentation and harmonies are fantastic , and the vaariety of genres they cover has only expanded ... definitely a 5 star performance ...
 Cibo Matto has managed to pull off something that other bands have been strugling with for years
 Like many of the reviewers here , I was very disappointed when this album came out . I was expecting `` Viva ! La Woman 2 '' , but did n't get it . Only `` Sci Fi Wasabi '' , `` Working For Vacation '' , and `` Moonchild '' really caught my ear . After a little while , I stuffed It away.Winter rolled around , and `` King of Silence '' caught on to me . Stuffed it away again . Jump forward to the winter of 2000 . I 'm working on a project , and decide to pop it in for inspiration . I fall in love with `` Lint of Love '' -LRB- which is my favorite song on the album -RRB- , and eventually the rest of them . The only song I ca n't really bear to hear is `` Blue Train '' , which is a bit excessive for my taste . That 's where the album loses a half a star . However , the rest of the album is great , and It reveals Its charms slowly . Give It a chance .
 I had never heard of Cibo Matto , but I read a review of Stereotype A in the LA Times which seemed to indicate it would appeal to me . So I listened to some sound samples and then took a flyer and bought the album.All I can say is I am absolutely under this album 's spell . I can not get over how good and interesting and moving and funky it is . It is fantastic and has rarely been out of my car 's CD player . When friend 's hear it they all say `` This is great . Who is it ? '' ... `` Cibo who ? '' Best Album of 1999 in my opinion
 I love this album so much that I have to play almost everyday !!! Cibo Matto however is not for everyone though , especially those who have bad taste in music ;P Cibo Matto 's music takes you beyond the crap that you hear everywhere else these days . It expands your mind through beautiful harmonies and breakbeats . Miho , Yuka , Sean , Timo and the rest of the Cibo Matto crew are an unbelievably talented bunch . If you love music , get this album , If you love life , get this album !!!!!! Long Live Cibo Matto !!!!!!!!!
 This is my first Cibo Matto CD , and it wo n't be my last ! There is no way to classify this CD musically . It 's as if lounge , rap , funk , pop , jazz , trip hop and lots of other stuff were just dumped into a mixmaster and splattered out of your speakers in all sorts of bizarre combinations . It 's very unique , and it has the catchiness of pop music but the loopy lyrics and music keep things from getting too normal and boring . Love it !!
 If you like eclectic sounds , this is the album to buy . Cibo Matto has always been able to blend tons of sounds into one album somehow and `` Stereo TypeA '' does n't sway from that formula . There is a little bit of everything on it , from rap beats , to latin sounds , to lounge and even a taste of heavy metal . Miho Hatori 's vocals are inchanting . I highly recommend this album to anyone with an ear for great music .
 YES , this album is more mainstream and derivative than ` Viva La Woman ' ... BUT , it is also a tremendous amount of fun . It 's not too often you find such stellar musicianship coupled with such utter goofiness .
 It 's absurd that C.M. would be criticized for evolving from a novelty act to a full fledged pop band . Bravo , Miho and Yuka for crafting a perfect slice of millenial pop .
 Stereotype A did not disappoint me at all . I actually love every single song in the album . and it shows that Cibo matto is not a duo-band anymore , some people miss before sean , timo and duma joined the band , ok , you can miss that , but you have to accept that their influence is great . what I like about Cibo Matto is that they are not obsssessed with any particular thing . they are so flexible and open . listen to Sci-fi wasabi , speechless and Sunday , they kick a ** .
 ill stop short of calling it genius but this is as close to a masterpiece as cibo have gotten so far ... and yes miho 's voice is amazing i dig her shrieking but i can get into this just as much
 Miho 's voice is extraordinary ... all these R&B singers -LRB- Brandy , Usher , etc -RRB- should watch out . A BIG improvement over VIVA LA WOMAN . To me , this is the best album I 've listened to since ABBEY ROAD . Not only are they talented but extrememly cute . This album is worth any price , I just bought a promo for $ 25 !
 This is the best music I have heard in a long while . It has a hard , edgy pop sound and the duo luckily refrain from the long ballads that ruined Viva La Woman in my opinion . If you like japanese girls singing pop this album is for you though the music snobs out there may not find this up to your level of snob.If this is so trite and unoriginal as one reviewer claimed why ca n't I find anything else like it ? I certainly do n't trust amazon 's recommendations in respect to this album , I want edgy pop not slow ballads .
 I loved `` Viva La Woman '' as much as anyone , but a concept album about food only works once -LRB- and it did work amazingly well -RRB- , so it was with some trepidation I bought this album , fearing `` food maddness '' was a one-trick pony ...

 Having been drawn into Cibo Matto 's music several years ago by a friend who referred to them as ` goddesses , pure and simple ' , I was quick to buy my own copy of `` Viva ! La Woman ! '' and adored the food anthems found on that album . . When Stereo * Type A was released , I saved up my pennies and grabbed a copy of this one , too.If you were n't sure you liked Viva ! La Woman , chances are you 'll find this album more reassuring . While VLW took some getting used to -LRB- for me , at least -RRB- , Stereo * Type A was a much smoother effort . Songs like Working for Vacation , Sci-Fi Wasabi , and Clouds became my new favorite tracks instantly and suffered long hours of ` repeat ' mode on my CD player.This one 's a keeper , folks . Go buy your own copy and see for yourself . ^_-
 This album bears many listenings . It 's fun , introspective , adventurous , techno , Japanese rap , sonic and delivered with a kind of coy sexuality . The -LRB- not over-hyped -RRB- addition of Sean Lennon on bass has added a little pop funk to their sound , but it 's the emergence of the two singers that really works so well . The lyrics are profound , but so simple - almost like translations of Japanese proverbs in the urban grunge of New York . LISTEN UP . You will like it . From around the world comes this soul-rebirth of Brazilian Tropicalia - the melting pot of styles that is our world .
 I first heard Cibo Matto while playing the Xbox gameJSRF - Jet Set Radio Future . Their song `` Birthday Cake '' really grew on me.After seeking out more of their music , I found this gem . Although I likedViva ! La Woman , I prefer this cd . There are very few weak spots here , the kind of cd you can listen to from start to finish . Do n't just buy an `` essential '' Cibo Matto disc , as you 'll miss out on some of the best songs on here .
 I straight listen to tons of 60s jazz and love talib , pharoah sanders , sly , don cherry , rza . but i think this album is great . everyone gives cibo matto mixed reviews but i think its that this is some great music in a kinda pop thang . i have always shocked people by digging this band and i never write reviews but this album deserves respect . its way fun and its got a great mix of ideas and sound . to conclude , look who guests on this album
 Like many of the reviewers here , I was very disappointed when this album came out . I was expecting `` Viva ! La Woman 2 '' , but did n't get it . Only `` Sci Fi Wasabi '' , `` Working For Vacation '' , and `` Moonchild '' really caught my ear . After a little while , I stuffed It away.Winter rolled around , and `` King of Silence '' caught on to me . Stuffed it away again . Jump forward to the winter of 2000 . I 'm working on a project , and decide to pop it in for inspiration . I fall in love with `` Lint of Love '' -LRB- which is my favorite song on the album -RRB- , and eventually the rest of them . The only song I ca n't really bear to hear is `` Blue Train '' , which is a bit excessive for my taste . That 's where the album loses a half a star . However , the rest of the album is great , and It reveals Its charms slowly . Give It a chance .
 A surprisingly mature album , after the one-joke -LRB- albeit a funny one -RRB- debut . The music is better thought-out and performed , and the lyrics have moved beyond food . OK , `` Sci-Fi Wasabi '' sounds like it could 've fit on VIVA WOMAN , but otherwise , there 's some good stuff going on here . I particularly like `` Speechless '' and the `` Sunday '' duo . I 'll need more listens to get a better picture , but so far , this one 's shaping up to be a semi-favorite for some time .
 Saw them on Austin City Limits Television Program . I was impressed with their sound ... so much so , I 'm fixin to purchase one of their CD 's . They blend jazz , R&B , rock , punk , regge and some rap , for a very saucy , spicy sound
 This CD contains two excellent full recordings from the heyday of 1980 's CCM . They are marked by a high amount of technical polish and refreshingly forthright lyrics . While the lyrics do n't achieve that simple , seemingly-effortless simplicity that Undercover managed on their `` God Rules '' recording -- here they 're a little awkward in spots -- they are nevertheless well-suited to the straighforward messages .
 Neil Innes evidently had a hand in the selection of cuts , so I hate like heck to say this . It 's not his fault . Blame the Beatles -LRB- for `` Sergeant Pepper '' -RRB- and blame Brian Wilson -LRB- for `` Pet Sounds '' -RRB- and blame Ray Davies -LRB- for `` Arthur '' -RRB- . Fact is , by the 1970s we had come to expect musical geniuses to produce The Album As Art Object . Most of this `` Recycled Vinyl '' CD comes from the 1973 masterpiece , `` How Sweet to Be an Idiot . '' `` How Sweet '' was an art object , a sparkling , francophilic , Faberge egg of sentimentality , full of sadness and joy and longing and optimism . After 27 years , I still love it.There are several considerations that make The Album As Art Object . One is a familiar sequence of tunes . Another is the purely musical transition in chords from one song to the next . Another is thematic unity or thematic sequence or both . And there are other considerations . Young CD hounds may be surprised to learn that , in the days of vinyl , music lovers would argue about which SIDE of an LP was better.Apparently , like the Ramones when they released `` All the Stuff , '' Innes imagined that `` Recycled Vinyl '' is the only CD of his work that will be released for the mass market , so he added some other songs -LRB- excellent in their own right -RRB- and stirred the pot . I hope that more CDs will follow and that `` How Sweet '' will be issued as itself , with its original cover art -LRB- fine photo of Innes as a duck-hatted harlequin -RRB- . So I hate like heck to take away one star for a compromise of artistic integrity . Innes forever ! Four stars .
 More than likely , the ONLY Neil Innes CD you 'll currently find on Amazon ! -LRB- The Rutles and The Bonzos do n't count . -RRB- . This CD is much more than the CD version of the VERY hard to find vinyl album , `` How Sweet To Be An Idiot '' -LRB- or `` A Go-Go '' , as it was originally re-issued . -RRB- , it contains the original album , plus the even harder to find only single released by The World -LRB- `` Angelina '' / `` Come Out Into The Open '' -RRB- , plus five hard to find songs , released as singles in the U.K. only ! -LRB- `` Recycled Vinyl Blues '' , `` Lie Down & Be Counted '' , `` Fluff On The Needle '' , `` Age of Desperation '' , and `` Bandwagon -LRB- Live -RRB- '' -RRB- . Buy it while it lasts !
 This is a re-release of `` How Sweet to be an Idiot '' . The original was great with wonderfully melodic songs , nice boogie rock , Lennonesque ballad -- and even a sense of humor . Worth the price -- and more !
 This is a 1994 re-issue of Neil 's 1973 `` How Sweet to be an Idiot '' and `` Neil Innes-a-Go-Go -RRB- , so you only need one of these to have the songs from the album . `` Idiot '' was Neil 's first solo album and shows that his songwriting talent was constantly developing and improving . He is considered one of the best songwriters of the 20th century . He has written songs anywhere from rockers to jazz to standards to country to just plain silly . Plus he 's just a great guy . I 'm a total fanatic .
 I have heard a lot of music and I play a few instraments myself , but I have never heard an acapella group that strums the chords of my heart like these five gentlemen . Its absolutely exhilerating . This is praise music ! I love it , and I hope you do to . Ohh to hear the Angelic choir of heaven , but until that time , let your ears feast on this collection ! Wonderful !
 This CD is amazing ! Glad sings wonderful music that is uplifting and heart-warming . In a bad mood or good , Glad is a great group to listen to any time . This CD has a great message and I would recommend it to anyone ! Their song `` Be Ye Glad '' has given me a whole new outlook on life . It was used in a sermon I listened to months ago and I have realized how much my aunt with cancer has suffered , but through it all , she still has God and nothing will seperate her from Him . It has given me a whole new sense of hope in my life .
 If you like to listen to real music , buy this CD . Dino is an unbelievable pianist with incredible talent . Dino is a world class pianist trained at Julliard . My favorite songs were Wind Beneath My Wings , and Somewhere Out There/Somewhere Over The Rainbow . The arrangements are beautiful , and the music is not only piano music , but is combined with other instruments in his music to enhance it . Once you buy this CD you will find it hard to not want to hear the songs again . I promise .
 This wonderful double CD has been unavailable for a while . Get it while you can ! `` Ai n't Gon na Be Your Dog '' should be as easily available as any of Wolf 's MCA/Chess compilations ... it gathers fourteen previously unreleased recordings which Wolf made for Sam Phillips in Memphis , as well as numerous other rare and unissued performances , alternates , and a handful of acoustic solo recordings featuring just Wolf and his guitar.And these are certainly not bottom-of-the-barrel scrapings . There are so many fine songs here , rough , tough , electric blues , superbly arranged , and featuring musicians like guitarist Willie Johnson , harpist James Cotton , saxists Billy Duncan , Eddie Shaw and J.T. Brown , several powerful yet swinging drummers , and piano players Hosea Lee Kennard and Johnny Jones . And Hubert Sumlin is here too , of course.There are too many highlights to mention , really , but I 'm going to pick a few anyway , like `` Poor Wind That Never Change '' , co-written by Wolf and Alex Atkins , and utilizing the tune of `` Careless Love '' , and one of the few Willie Dixon-songs on this compilation , `` Long Green Stuff '' . The vast majority of these 42 songs are written by the Wolf himself , and many of them , like `` Decoration Day Blues '' , `` Getting Late '' and the instrumental `` Wolf In The Mood '' , display Wolf 's prowess on the harmonica much better than most of the better-known Chess sides.Songs like `` Color And Kind '' , `` Highway My Friend '' , the horn-driven `` Oh Red '' , and the late-60s powerhouses `` I Had A Dream '' and `` The Big House '' are all among Wolf 's best original compositions , and you have to be impressed by the complex slide guitar riff that he plays on the solo performance of `` Rollin ' And Tumblin ' '' - while he is singing , that is.This is not the place to start appreciating the Wolf , but once you 've got his classic Chess sides , make sure you grab this one as well . It is a tremendous addition to his legacy .
 I think it would be very useful to have audio clips of this CD so that people can experience Barry Douglas and his ethereal talents .
 Greetings , You would n't believe how often I listen to your CD , `` Reflections of Green '' . It 's my tranquility restorer . I use it to gear down after work and I do a sort of yoga - stretching routine to it using small handweights and slow toning movements.When you 're ready to do an excercise video to it , let me know . I have a whole routine worked out to it , to push out the bad energy and to pull the good energy back in . Anyway , I just love it . I 'm so much more at peace inside since I got it . Thanks a million !
 Douglas Barry Butler has indeed found his niche and comes full circle with it . His ear for meditational sounds is proven in his work - and meditational it is ! It is beautiful and constant in its serenity . A trip in a space stations with a window view , but unlike the norm in spacey music , romance is felt . A romantic and warm view of the outter limits . Mr. Butler 's debut has startled my visions of the stars ... Enya and Vangelis should be proud to have someone so closely to follow in their steps . Lush sweeps in his song Islands , and icey warm twinkles throughout the album . A definite good buy !
 This is a very relaxing and introspective recording . Great for a candlelight , rain filled evening of solitude or prehaps some mutual exploration with a soul mate .
 One of the calmest , yet vibrant collection of songs I have heard in years . The way it presents itself is at first almost unnoticeable - like a rain in the forest which plays itself out and crescendos like the force of a waterfall . Meditation music has never been so beautiful .
 Reflections of Green is a great album . I suggest buying it . The first track islands is very good.The cover is very inspiring.LEJ .
 Maybe cause I heard this album way back in the day and for Christian music it was lightyears ahead of most anything else - I still think it gets 5 stars . The first half is fine but my favorite is the second half.Now newly remastered and with extra material.So `` worldly '' sounding and so good and still spiritual impact.I love it . -LRB- As far as Hendrix comment on Keaggy - see snopes.com -RRB-
 I 'm a long time listener of Glass Harp and Phil Keaggy . I 'm not a music critic , so this review will be simple . This is a good classic rock album for people who like the Beatles and Simon and Garfunkel . They 're kind of mellow on this album . Phil Keaggy has some great guitar solos -LRB- made even more amazing by the fact that he has only 9 fingers -RRB- .
 The final alblum of the Youngstown Trio , `` It Makes Me Glad '' is also the best . Phil Keagy -LRB- Vocals & Lead Guitar -RRB- once hailed as the worlds greatest rock & roll guitar player by Jimi Hendrix , gives an electrifing performance with inovative technique and style . A mile stone in Christian Rock , `` Glad '' is a must have !
 It 's a must have if you are a Phil Keaggy fan . In fact , buy all of Glass Harp 's albums-old and new . Then start working through all of Phil 's albums . The guy is just an amazing guitar player , and one of the humblest people I 've ever met ... Clarence
 In fact it made me deliriously happy when this cd came back in print in a wonderfully remastered condition . This is one of my all time favorite albums by one of my all time favorite bands . Although it is only legend , the old story goes that when Jimi Hendrix was asked how it felt to be the best guitar player in the world , he replied `` I do n't know . Ask Phil Keaggy . '' PK is a guitar player 's guitar player . He rocks . And Glass Harp rocks . This is a must own cd !
 `` It Makes Me Glad '' By Glass Harp
 Great album with the best at the end . Phil Keaggy -LRB- who claims Jimi Hendrix never said that Keaggy was the best in the world-but it IS a believable statement once you have heard him play -RRB- , Dan Pecchio and John Sferra play some music of their time but it is done so well it still stands up today.Hints of Yes , ELP , and other bands - but fresher and more satisfying to my ears .
 I have been a Glass Harp fan for several years and I consider them the greatest band no one has ever heard of . My musical tastes and interests tend to gravitate to those who are `` under the radar '' Phish , Iron and Wine etc.It Makes me Glad is my favorite of the original 3 albums . This album has more of a popish mellow kind of sound , more so than their other albums and I am totally fine with that . With the exception of the Trilogy -LRB- D&G ; , Going Home and Do Lord -RRB- this album features some of Glass Harp 's lesser known songs , among these is Sailing on a River which is my absolute fave . These are songs you do n't hear live at one of their few and far between concerts.I like this album because it is mellow and relaxing and I urge everyone who has an interest in this type of music to check It Makes Me Glad out , you wont be sorry .
 arrived on time and in good condition . thank you . keaggy is a genius and jimi Hendrix knew it !
 If your tastes tend toward Celtic New Age or Irish elevator music , do n't buy this CD . If possible , this music is even more authentic than Colm O'Donnell 's on `` Farewell to Evening Dances '' , BogFire 's other current release . If you 've ever attended a session in a small rural pub in Ireland and long to return , this CD will intensify your longing . Buy this CD before musicians like Kevin Henry disappear .
 I thought the CD was excellent . Some of the greatest Irish music I have ever heard . The poems are spoken with great heart that you are mesmorized . this CD is for anyone who loves Irish music . I hope he makes another one !
 I often associate certain albums with seasons and weather . Springsteen 's BORN TO RUN will always remain an essential summertime album ... while The Velvet Underground 's self-titled album is the perfect album for rainy winter nights.The Absinthe album , A GOOD DAY TO DIE , is one that receives continous plays when autumn and winter begin to show their seasons . Mind you , this album could be played at any time of the year and would be equally as wonderful . Still , the haunting themes of death , bittersweet childhood memories and regret do make this a fine soundtrack for days and nights of relentless wind and rain . There is not a bad song on this album ... and it is an album that contains many great songs . Even days after having listened to this album , I continue to find songs such as `` Messed Up Likes of Us '' or `` It Do n't Bother Me '' still ringing in my head . Much like the demons that Springsteen excorcised with his DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN album , BoDean Sammy Llanas does much of the same with this album . Majestic and gracefully played as this album is , it is not an emotionally easy album to digest ... it cuts right to the heart and gut , a quality that makes it all the greater in my book . Right now it 's December 30 , 2005 ... and the rain is pouring down and the wind is whipping around like mad on this night . While may not be a good day to die , it is the perfect night to play an album as fine as A GOOD DAY TO DIE . And that 's exactly what I plan to do as soon as I finish this review . If one is brave enough to come face to face with the demons that make up both one 's childhood -LRB- `` Neighborhood Bully '' or `` A Good Day to Die '' or `` It Do n't Bother Me '' -RRB- , as well as the demons that often plague adulthood -LRB- `` Messed Up Likes of Us '' -RRB- , then you owe it to yourself to get a hold of this album!And I 'd be willing to bet that it will become the soundtrack to haunted nights such as the one during which this was written ...
 Being a huge BoDeans fan from years past , I had to give this solo effort by Sam Llanas a try . I was prepared to be disappointed , but was instead overwhelmed by the beauty and dark intensity of this album . The songs obviously chronical a tragic event in Sam 's life -LRB- the death of his brother -RRB- , but also draw from other childhood memories as well . A lot of artists would fail at this type of material , as it leaves a lot of room to come off sounding trite , but Sam executes such a mix of powerfull lyrics and superb musical composition that the album is nothing short of a masterpiece . It has been a staple in my CD player for weeks and shows no sign of aging poorly . It is one of my best music purchases this year , and I have made many . Very highly recommended .
 A beautiful album . When one chooses to listen to A Good Day To Die , it 's necessary to be ready to accept it . Just as many of the best movies have unhappy or tragic endings , this album ends up being one of the best in my collection . There is nothing to hold you back from becoming one with this record . Deep tones , mystic lyrics , haunting melodies . It 's just yummy .
 It 's by far the best collection of material that Llanas , or the BoDeans for that matter , has put together . One of my fave BD CD 's is `` Love & Hope & Sex & Dreams '' , but Sammy 's writing here is his best to date . It is further enhanced artistically through the musical magic of this Absinthe group.These great musicians are locked together in deep solid grooves , and you quickly sink into their incredible quicksand of sound and beauty . Absinthe reflects and compliments the intent and context of Sammy 's especially heart felt and moving song stories . Definitely a musical milestone .
 After seeing Absinthe live about a year ago , I was anxious for a release . `` A Good Day to Die '' has surpassed my expectations . The music can be dreamy ; the words can be poignant ; and the general feel of this album can be agitating .
 Llanas 's sings with so much emotion , every song is believable
 Sammy Llanas has put together a wonderful tribute to his brother . His lyrics create images that everyone can relate to , and the pain of his brother 's death is felt throughout the cd . The music has the familiar ring of some earlier BoDeans songs , such as True Devotion and Far , Far Away From My Heart . That 's the type of music that keeps me coming back for more !
 Sam Llanas of Bodeans displays his immense songwriting talents - a personal album , but addicting , as the best music can be . Thanks , Sam & Absinthe boys -LRB- & girls -RRB- , keep it up ...
 You simply have to be in the right mood for this disc ; if not you wont enjoy it . If you are in a soulful mood and wish to enter a sort of dream-state where childhood memories can come rushing back to you , this is the disc.Personally , I like to pour a beer and just sit with this disc playing . It has a way to pull from the fog some really important memories that had for too long been buried under less meaningful things.That said , I can not say I `` love '' this disc as I do all the BoDeans albums . The BoDeans tend to be a little more upbeat and I can listen to their music pretty much anytime . Here , Sam Llanas has cut some powerful songs that you have to be ready for . If your are , you 'll really enjoy it . Worth owning for those times you need it !
 If you like The Bodeans , you like this ! Its as good as any of their albums and better than the newer non-Sammy one .
 Although this video is not a live performance , it is a collection of what are the best songs from their catalog.It has Ian Astbury and the band in their prime , and they deliver the goods MTV style.Songs performed are as follows
 The music on this album is great , I really like it . The guys are really strong Christians . -LRB- i 've met them in person -RRB- !!!! I would recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys listening to good christian music !! thanks
 i only got to see this video once and i loved it ... i can never find a copy of the tap this is real hard o find it had all my fav songs on here
 Another fine addition to Herreweghe 's series of cantatas with excellent singing and crisp fine instrumental playing throughout . Mr. Herreweghe uses female singers for the soprano and alto parts , instead of the boy soloists that were used in Bach 's time . Unlike some authentic performance artists , they sound distinctively feminine and full-bodied , not imitational of the `` boy '' sound . Of particular note is the fine trumpet playing in the chorus of both Cantata 43 and 11 . Peter Kooy is my favorite Bass for Bach Cantatas and displays his art masterfully in the bass aria `` Er ists , der ganz allein '' along with the above mentioned trumpet .
 This CD is devoted to the feast of the Ascension . Of the three works on this CD , one is an oratorio -LRB- BWV 11 -RRB- and two are cantatas , but the oratorio is so short that it could have been called a cantata , and one of the cantatas -LRB- BWV 43 -RRB- is so long that it could have been called an oratorio . Ultimately , however , terminology does n't matter . Bach 's sacred music is not an art for its own sake
 Tony Touch 's The Piece Maker WAS an underrated mixtape , as another reviewer said , but what about This Or That ? Has anyone even heard of this?A lot of people know Sway as the MTV News anchor , but did you know that he is one of the three masterminds that worked the wheels of steel on this album ? Some people may remember seeing the video for `` The Anthem '' in ' 99 . The song features RZA , Tech N9NE , Xzibit , Pharoahe Monch , Kool G Rap , Chino XL , Jayo Felony , KRS-One , and then-newcomer Eminem . By the way , I think Chino XL could be referred to as the original Eminem , in that he disses everyone for no reason -LRB- the only difference is that when Chino disses , nobody cares -RRB- . The song is solid , although I think Pharoahe 's verse sounded just okay compared to everyone else 's . Also , I do n't know what Jayo Felony 's purpose is there -LRB- listen to his verse to understand what I mean -RRB- . The other full-length songs are pretty dope as well . Guru shines as usual on `` NY N 's '' , and Eminem 's `` Get You Mad '' is pretty good too . -LRB- His later songs were better , but he was just starting out then . -RRB- And the guys in Jurassic 5 drop the usual dope stuff on `` Improvise '' . Other great parts on the album include `` Reality Check '' , where Gang Starr relate on beef . Canibus drops dope bars on his two freestyles -LRB- since this is n't one of his albums , there 's actually dope production to back him up -RRB- , and the final skit , `` Wake Up Show Trivia '' , is pretty funny.Very few mixtapes are flawless , so there are a few things I have to comment on . `` Underground Tactics '' -LRB- by Heltah Skeltah , Crooked Eye and Planet Asia -RRB- is good but it 's censored . And Bobby Digital -LRB- aka RZA -RRB- sounds fine at the beginning of `` Belly Of The Beast '' , but after a while everything goes downhill ... REALLY downhill.In the end , DJs Sway , King Tech and Revolution produced a very underappreciated -LRB- and maybe unheard-of -RRB- album in mid-1999 . Maybe this mixtape was underpromoted or something , but at any rate , go pick it up because it 's definitely worth hearing .
 The album is very solid . ` The Anthem ' is an ill song -LRB- as you can tell from the list of artists on it -RRB- . But what really made me glad to get this album is the freestlye that Canibus laid down , that whole freestyle was ill . Pick this joint up .
 pretty good cd ... the ANTHEM is the best of all the songs ... TECH N9NE BLEW IT UP ! ... made the others sound WAK !
 It 's not that I do n't like this album . As a matter of fact , I love it , for the most part . It 's just that there are n't many amazing hip-hop songs on it . There are a lot of GOOD songs , but none that are really great . `` The Number One Crew '' -LRB- the wakeup show theme song -RRB- , `` The Anthem '' , `` Rework the Angels '' , `` Improvise '' , I Know You Got Soul '' , `` Get You Mad '' and the freestyles by Chali 2na -LRB- Charlie Tuna from Jurassic 5 -RRB- and Canibus are all VERY GOOD SONGS . But only `` The Anthem '' is a really GREAT song . All in all , this is a very good mix tape with good songs and a lot of underground hip-hop , however , if you buy this album -LRB- As I did ... -RRB- BE WARNED
 This is an excellent compilation filled with lyrical masterminds , phenomenal production , and awesome DJs ... All over this CD Sway , King Tech & DJ Revolution are making a mockery out of commercialized hiphop and they do it in a very comical way -LRB- especially in the album cover and in the intro -RRB- ... There 's so much talent to see on this CD especially
 I bought this album when it first came out in 99 , more than 10 years ago now , made a tape of it , took it to school , listened to it all day . Some kid permanently borrowed it but the collection of songs and the people on it are so memorable that I never forgot it , and re-bought it . This album has some of the best songs from the end of the 90s and some older , they rock hard and will never get old .
 Between the beautiful , flowing rap , the groovy beats and the fun interludes , there 's very , very little not to like about this album . The only reason you should stay away from it is if you do n't enjoy interludes or DJ mixes . Otherwise there 's plenty of replay value in this disc .

 This Album is off the hook . No doubt , with Sway , Tech and Dj Revolution you can never go wrong . So if you dont have this , you need to peep this out with tha quickness and WAKEUP !
 I got Flex , and others and thought that they were n't representin . The greatest test of any tape or cd is the number of songs that they lay it down . This cd has at least 10 songs where they lay it down . Notables include The Anthem , Belly of the Beast , T.R.O.Y. and Canibus 's freestyle .
 TIGHT AS HELL ... love the way they brought back all the old school from the era we grew up in . It ' t not as far back as the OG 's of the game but far enough to take me back to the days of when I was a young lad S & KT brung it on this one !!!! Much love from ya cali folks !!!
 99 seems to be the year of mix tapes first soundbombing two now this what next ? this cd is phat from what ive heard . ive already heard the anthem , get you mad by Eminem , and Chino XL 's joint and belive me ill be picking this one up .

 To all you gangsters out there ! This is hip-hop in its purest form and this is how it should be . All this gun , money , Versace , and crystal talk in today 's rap just plain wack . So , know your hip-hop and buy this dope mix tape ! -LRB- ya heard ' -RRB- P.S. Watch out for those `` sucka emcees . ''
 Hmm i never knew this was an official album cos it was played start 2 finish a month back on a local radio show i just thought it was some mix tape thingy but anyway its got some cool tunes on it if u have n't got all the old skool tracks like the main source and pete rock and cl etc then buy it ... other than that the anthem is cool its good to see chino xl has n't lost his touch . . the freestyle bits at the end is cool as well but i know they ai n't freestyles and they pre-written . . cos canibus spits the same verse that he said on the westwood show a while back . other than that tightly mixed by styles of beyond 's DJ Revolution . . good stuf
 Sway and Techs CD is phat its full of great rappers and phat beats . The Anthem is one of the best songs out there.This CD and soundbombing2 are the best mix tapes this year . So buy this CD if you like Hip-Hop not that BS you see on TV .
 As far as I 'm concerned , this is really a mix tapes which happens to have a few new songs . Based on that , I think it 's very good . It 's not however one of the better albums of the year -LRB- I personally prefer PE 's and EPMD 's album over this -RRB- I have stayed away from buying most mix tape CD 's because I 've been usually disappointed , but this is pretty good .
 This is by far one of the sickest CDs i have bought in a while . If had to compare this to Soundbombings 2 like everyone else i would have to agree with them that soundbombings is slightly better but if you are an eminem fan , his joint on this CD will blow you out of the water . DJ Revolution does an awesome job of mixing on every track . The freestyles in the end are just the icing on the cake . GEt this you wo n't regret it .
 After I heard the anthem , I knew this CD was gon na rock . It features some great cuts and frestyles . Sure it deos n't top Soundbombing 2 , but what can ? A great CD that all underground fans should get
 Never heard of the guys before , but now me and the whole intire world will remember these guys after this phat CD . I love the way real HIP-HOP is taking back over for the 99 and beyond . go `` cop '' this people you want be disappionted.twin _ uno _ representing Atlanta , GA
 sway & kind tech throw down some tight beats in this good all around cd . the anthem is just a fat song and not to mention they add in some freestyles from canibus and redman . if u really listen to hip hop u should buy this cd cuz it 's a fat mix . it 's almost as good as dj clue ? 's cd . peace .
 just like my man from miami said , it 's almost as good as soundbombing 2 . This album has alot of underground stuff and also has stuff like redman and epmd . all tru hip-hop heads need 2 pick this one up soon .
 I have been a fan of music -LRB- namely Hip-Hop -RRB- for nearly 10 years . I like the way that I feel after listening to a really good album . I have n't felt this way about a mix tape in a very long time , but Sway & Tech changed that . This album is ranked up there with the likes of The Beat Junkies and Flex . Any true Headz out there should buy this album , not because of some strangers review , but because you owe it to youreself . The only reason I did n't give this album a perfect score is because they just you with samples of so many nice tracks ! In case you are wondering who exactly is worth listening to on the album , I 'll tell you . Guru , Dj Premier , Eminem , Eric B. & Rakim , Xzibit ... and many more . Buy , Buy , Buy !!!!!!
 I 've been listening to the CD for 2 days now and I really like most of the songs off of it . Some are n't my style but they 're still good . This CD 's almost as good as the Soundbombing 2 CD . Definately worth the money .
 This is one of the best cd 's I 've heard in a while . Sway and king tech come through with 60 minutes of bangin beats . It 's a must get .
 I bought this album on a whim because the title is my favorite school of chemicals ... my God was I surprised at how incredible it was . Anywhen is a band from Sweden . I really do n't know much else about them , but if you are at all a fan of orchestral , beautiful , slow , melancholic music such as Tindersticks , Leonard Cohen , The Blue Nile , Codeine , or Red House Painters ... dark , rainy night music , you owe it to yourself to try this . The themes of the album are obvious from the title -- struggling to find beauty , or at least oblivion/numbness , in an ugly world . I do n't know if Anywhen had any personal run-ins with the opiates , but the first song , `` Siren Song '' seems to me to be about the temptation to give in to the chemical oblivion that seems to be calling your name . The two Anywhen musicians are joined by an entire orchestra , and the strings are especially beautiful on this track . Other highlights include `` Scars and Glasses '' , `` Where 's The High ? '' , `` Mesmerene '' and `` All That Numbs You '' . From the title of this album , I knew at least that Anywhen had good taste in pharmaceuticals ... it shows in their taste for flawless musical compositions .
 Wow!That 's all I have to say
 its a magic piece of work , for calm music lovers . I would say this album is pure poetry , its a great help to think , to write , to paint , to live.loving tones , lyrics , musical spaces.emotion . belief . respect for the beautiful and dark sie of life.for sure one of the best albuns I have ever listened ... thank you T. Feiner .
 all you people know that fiend is the god of no limit.Cant no one stop him . July the 6 was the best day for me . You gots to get this cd !
 This cd is just as good as all the other fiend cds and maybe even better . Spend some money and go get . Feind is staying tru more than anyother no limit soulja . Go get the cd
 Fiend is the man . This is the best cd I 've ever bought . I did n't think you could make a cd this good . I like every song on there . The last song is what surprised me , though . It 's like a song for God , but a song for the people . It took some time to make that song , it 's tight . Fiend definitely had the right set of producers behind him . Now all he needs is a music video or two , and a couple of songs on the radio ... that 's instant success right there . 4X Platinum . This right here is gon na sell millions , MILLIONS . Much love to the best rapper out there , MR. WHOMP WHOMP !!! And hey , he 's been the best out there ever since his last album , so go pick that one up too .
 i just bought this cd , and i can alreayd tell that this cd is as good as his last . i just listened to track 17 , that is the chillest SONG EVER ! if you are a no limit fan this is a must have !
 This cd is the best no limit cd and Fiend is the best no limit rapper . This cd is much better then his last one cuz he is rapping the same way he does in other peoples cd 's . Get this album y' all it is tight and you wo n't be dissapointed .
 STREET LIFE IS HOT I LIKE TO SAY IF YOU ARE A TRUE NOLIMIT FAN THEN YOU MUST HAVE THIS CD 's AND IF NOT YOU SHOULD TRY IT ANYWAY . FIEND PUT MUCH TIME IN THIS CD 's AND KLC AND BEATS BY THE POUND REALLY LAID IT DOWN BUT FIEND DID N'T DO IT ALONE HE HAS MIAX , MYSTIKAL , MAGIC HELP TO MAKE IT REALLY HOT AND OFF THE CHAIN .
 I DO NOT KNOW WHY YOU , MR. EAGAN , MN , IS DISSING FIEND AND HE 'S NEW ALBUM IT IS GOING TO BE THE BOMB . AND SO WANT HE HAS TO MUCH SWEARING WHO DOES ` NT . SO WATCH `` STREET LIFE '' IS GOING TO BE 2x PLATNIUM JUST WATCH , YOU 'LL SEE .
 I DO NOT KNOW WHY YOU , MR. EAGAN , MN , IS DISSING FIEND AND HE 'S NEW ALBUM IT IS GOING TO BE THE BOMB . AND SO WANT HE HAS TO MUCH SWEARING WHO DOES ` NT . SO WATCH `` STREET LIFE '' IS GOING TO BE 2x PLATNIUM JUST WATCH , YOU 'LL SEE .
 If Street Life is half as good as his last album than this is an album you do n't want to miss out on . Fiend next to 2Pac , Too Short , Mystikal , DMX , and E-40 is my favorite rapper of all time .
 ... finally Fiend came out wit a new one , and i must say the cd is hella tight , like all the other No-limit cd 's . It 's 2 bad that the Beats by the pound has left No-limit records , but they have also a good sound now.If u already have this album go pick up Mac 's new album World-war 3 , it 's also featured some new soldiers on dat album . . ex Popeye , Xl , Sam , Renior , D.i.g. & more .
 On his sophomore album , Fiend mixes things up a little , most notably including only four guest appearances , as opposed to the fifty or so on his last album . On `` Ak 'n Bad , '' over a grimy beat , Mystikal steals the show with the fast paced stutter-stop flow he 's mastered . `` Heart Of A Ghetto Boy '' is a subdued track on which Fiend slows his flow to match the sax in the background . The track is a welcome break from the rowdiness of the first six tracks . On `` Walk That Line , '' he totally flips his flow . You got ta listen to it more than once to fully appreciate it . Other standout tracks include `` The Rock Show , '' `` Trip To London , '' and `` Waiting On God . `` The album could 've done without songs like `` The Truth Is '' and `` They Do n't Hear Me , '' as they do n't bring anything new to the table . But overall , `` Street Life '' is one of the better No Limit releases of recent memory .
 I used to love No Limit . I bought every single CD they released , wack or not . This CD and WWIII were two of the top five No Limit CD 's easily , because they were about Fiend and Mac and not No Limit and Beats By The Pound -LRB- which made No Limit what it was , the beats first and the rappers second , until the two previously mentioned CD 's . -RRB- In truth , the majority of the CD 's they released are all worthy of buying again . I just spent about $ 250.00 buying a bunch of their old CD 's that I used to have back in the day and ca n't find anymore , NO MASTER P CD 's ! His CD 's were disappointments except Last Don and Ghetto Dope . And where can I find TRU with Smokin Green on it instead of the bonus songs ??????
 Sleepy-Eyed Jones done did it again ! Fiend has always been one of my favorite artist on the No Limit label , not only because i know him personally , but because he has possessed the talent and the drive to make it out of the hard streets and into the music industry . Plus I can feel his music , because I know where he is coming from when he says something about the death of his older brother . Street Life is an album that surprised me ! It is nothing like it was expected to be . Fiend is so much on the hip-hop level that I almost forgot that he is from New Orleans . But do n't get me wrong , I am not saying that he does n't represent The Crescent City because you know that he will always do that . But he goes in a different direction on this album . Beats by the Pound hooks him up with the funky , trunk rattling , beats that make it easy to nodd your head to this album . Twelve out of seventeen of the songs are written and performed by Fiend and that is a plus for him . If a rapper ca n't do an album by himself , then i figure he should n't be in the rap game . I am not saying there is something wrong with helping other artist by introducing them on your album or giving the people a little taste of what to expect from an artist , but having a whole album , with your name on the cover , but you only have two songs written and performed by only you . Come on , is that really showing your talent ? By me saying this , I am not trying to hate on any other single rapper or duo , I am speaking in general to the whole industry from a listeners perspective . I like to buy a CD to hear what this rapper can do , not everyone else . But once again , there is nothing wrong with having your fellow label mates or anybody else doing a special appearence to help you or them out .
 Fiends latest album sounds nothing like his first . He got rid of the usual 20 guest appearances per album and did the almost the whole album by himself . With hits like Talk It How I Bring It , War 4 Reason , Mr. Whomp Whomp , Waiting On God this is easily the most slept on album in 99 . Fiend is one of the realest MC 's out right now . And I ca n't for that Tank Dogg 's to drop . No Limit 2000
 Whenever a person makes you think about what there saying in their rap , their real . I really think all music listeners who care to hear a message in the music should listen to Fiend 's track 7 . Heart of a Ghetto Boy.Fiend is mad real yo
 Even though it has been seven years since it dropped i still rock this album truly especially my songs Talk It How I Bring It and Mr.Whomp Whomp . What I find interesting and very unique is how he focused solely on it being about him and his project alone and eliminating all those annoying as collaborations that rappers usually have on albums . Fiend really comes with it and represents who he is and where he 's from on this album . I totally and completely disagree with those pitiful folks who try to say the album was disappointing because it didnt feature more collaborations . Hello when are they going to wake up and realize whose name is on the album and whose music is it . This album definitely wasnt a typical NL album -LRB- thankfully -RRB- . By the way i am glad fiend left that sorry label
 Fiends sophmore album Street Life is pretty good . . could 've been better . Fiend has matured like every NO LIMIT artist does on their sophmore albums -LRB- C-Murder , Silkk the Shocker , Mr. Serv-On , Magic , Mac , Steady Mobb ` n , Skull Duggery , Kane & Abel , Mystikal and Mia X -RRB- . . The tightest song is Mr. Whomp Whomp . . all the other songs are good as well . Fiend is one of NO LIMIT 's top 10 best ... and that is sayin something with how big they family is ... remember to pick up MYSTIKAL-LET 'S GET READY TO RUMBLE ... and if you ai n't got em yet Master P-Only God can Judge Me..Mac-World War III..Magic-Thuggin . . Tru-Da Crime Family that is PLATINUM ... and Mercedes-Rear End which has went GOLD ... and remember the haters only stop NO LIMIT cause we are so far in front of you . . You heard that ?
 Any album with a song deep as # 17 Waiting on God deserves 5 stars . My other favorites were # 3 Talk it how I bring it , # 6 Akn Bad , # 9 The Truth is , # 11 Mr. Whomp Whomp , and # 12 I was placed here . Fiend is clearly the best rapper in Hip-Hop and I ca n't wait to get Magic 's new album .
 Fiend is one of the tightest rappers out there , and is 100 % the most slept on . His latest CD just like his first two expresses a wide range of emotions . You can listen to this project from start to finish -LRB- where ever you are from -RRB- . He is the only rapper inthe post-Pac era whom you truly feel and believe their emotion -LRB- he do n't be barking or unghing and sh*t -RRB- If you realy want a top of the line disc that has content and actually says something then you should ceck out `` Street Life '' , ya heard me .
 This is the tightest album from no limit besides tru this year.This album is tight from # 1 to # 17 . # 8 AND # 17 deepest songs on this album . # 2 , # 3 , # 5 , # 6 , # 9 , # 10 , # 11 , # 13 , and # 14 are the tightest songs on here so this gets 5 stars .
 Fiend is one of the best people in the rap game and he should stay with no limit but besides that this album is deep like # 17 and got the rowdy tracks like # 2,5,6,10,11 street life is a hot album keep doing your thing Mr.Whomp , Whomp
 This cd is the best thing from No Limit in a very long time
 THIS CD WAS HOT FROM WHEN THEY FIRST THOUGHT OF THE IDEA OF STREET LIFE . IT HAS MAD TRACKS ON IT FEAUTURING HIS NO LIMIT FAMILY.TO ALL THE OTHER FANS WHO DONT HAVE IT REST IN PEACE . WHAT 'S GOING ON MYSTIKAL , PARTNER , LET ME NO. 2985289/KENNY/8056431 / PAGER
 I actually do n't even like no limit , the only artists I am down wit right now are Mystikal and Fiend and I just picked up the new joint `` Street Life '' and it was blazin . The self-titled intro sets up the whole album . The best cuts are `` The Rock Show '' `` Trip To London '' `` They Do n't Hear Me '' and what may be the deepest and most constructed piece of hip hop ever is the last cut `` Waiting on God '' which actually got me thinking . This cat needs to leave no limit and start up his own cause he 's got some skillz .
 Fiend gets mad props for limiting the guest on this album unlike his last album . My favorite songs was # 6 the song with Mystikal and Skull Dugrey , # 8 with Kage , # 9 , and the best song on the album # 17 . This is one of the deepest albums I heard in a while . Out of the two albums I like his first one better .
 I THOUGHT LAST YEARS TANK MASTERPIECE `` THERES ONE IN EVERY FAMILY '' COULD NOT BE TOPPED , BUT THIS TRU TANK DOGG STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE AND KNOCKED OUT ANOTHER GRANDSLAM !!! . FIRST OFF WHEN YOU HEAR FIEND YOU KNOW ITS HIM BECAUSE HE DISTINGUISHES HIMSELF WITH HIS SIGNATURE VOICE.WITH KLC OF BEATS BY THE POUND DOING THE MAJORITY OF THE PRODUCTION , HIS BEATS AND FIEND GO TOGETHER LIKE NO LIMIT TANKS AND PLATINUM PLAQUES . THE STANDOUT SONGS ARE `` THEY DONT HEAR ME '' , `` THE ROCK SHOW '' AND THE GET CRUNK ANTHEM `` MR.WHOMP WHOMP '' . I RECOMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE WHETHER YOURE A NO LIMIT FAN OR NOT .
 this cd has some real good beats and lyrics . Everybody that likes No Limit needs to go get , its worth all the money ,

 Look , Fiend has showed us all that he has what it takes . He 's earned every sparkle of diamond and gold on that No Limit tank , and he himself has the tendency to outshine everybody on the label . Strickly based on his raps he 's the best , with the right production team behind him , BEATS BY THE POUND , he 's the illest . Fiend 's cd is gon na be off the hook . Go spend fifteen dollars and get it .
 I 'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SAY , FRIST MOST OF NO LIMIT 'S CD 'S ARE JUST STRAIGHT HITS WITH EAR RIPPING LYRICS . AND FIEND IS THE MOST LYRIC OF THEM ALL , AND FOR PEOLPE THAT LIKE THOSE KIND OF RHYMES CHECK THIS ABLUM OUT FAST AND HIS -LRB- FIEND 'S -RRB- BOY MAC THE TITLE 'S CD CALLED SHELL SHOCKED MORE P.H.A.T LYRICS . IT 'S A MUST BUY AND IF YOU LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAYING YOU 'LL FEEL THE SAME WAY . NO LIMIT
 Fiends sophmore album Street Life is pretty good . . could 've been better . Fiend has matured like every NO LIMIT artist has . .

 I listen to the CD and it was tight . I 'm feeling his style and his music . Represent that NO to the fullest ! I ai n't from NO but i 'm digging his music ! I listen to everybody no matter where they are from or they are underground with no radio play . It 's all good ! Thanks!Dee SmallsRepresenting Decatur , GA
 sure some may not think it is as good as his first but this is a good ablum . War 4 reason is a hot song worth buying just for that song . The beats bang and of course it 's top notch production , this cd is worth buying if your a no limit or just fiend fan .
 Fiend is a southern tornato ! KLC 's Beats and Fiends flow put together is 2nd tightest on the tank only to mystikal and KLC . Fiends has much talent in this rap game . Fiend has shown that with time his game only gets tighter . I look very forward to the release of Fiends next release . Fiend has shown also that he 's for sure just listen to his emotion in his rap . I praise him for that because many rappers today just rap to rap but Fiends puts 110 % in all of his music thats why he is one of my fav 's ! Stay TRU Fiend
 I ENJOY FIEND RHYMES AND CONCEPT WITH STREET LIFE AND LIFE IN GENERAL . THAT 'S REAL
 He the deepest in the game , best voice lyrics everythin
 Just when everyone thought NO LIMIT was falling off , BOOM !!! This CD is tight !!! I have been waiting on this CD for a long time . He is definitely one of the best rappers in the game . He put NO LIMIT back on top with this album . I started to forget about NO LIMIT until I heard this CD . My favorite tracks are The Rock Show , Talk It How I Bring It , Heart Of A Ghetto Boy , I Been Through It All , Mr. Womp Womp , Where Do I Belong , and I Losing My Mind . The whole thing is off the hook !!!!!!!!!!
 almost 10 years after his death in a car crash , his austrian record label finally releases a worthy best-of-cd of austria 's most famous pop singer . for the first time this collection includes -LRB- almost -RRB- all of his most popular and successful hits . over 2 cds you get a well balanced collection of his best songs -LRB- maybe there is a bit too much material from his first three albums , but one could argue that this albums , released from 1982 to 1985 , were also his best -RRB- . most important for many fans is the fact that this collection of songs includes hits from all of his 9 albums -LRB- of which 2 were released after his death -RRB- so you get a good impression for falco 's work from 1981 to 1998 . there are even a few collector 's items
 I grew up with Falco . I am from Geremany and now live in the USA . So it is nice to be able to sing along with all those great songs no matter what language they are in . He was a great artist , gone before his time . It is a peferct CD because it has all the songs on it I want to hear , especially the ones never released in America . That I only ever heard in Germany . So I now get them both , great to have.But shipping was quick for standard and the product was just as advertised new -LRB- all sealed in platic -RRB- , no scratches , play 's excellant , and LOUD !
 Get this album ! There is a variety of Falco 's work in this collection and for the most part , well worth every dime . My favorite ? `` Out of the Dark . '' Hands down , this is his best song . I bought the album just for this song but there are many other songs on the 2 CD 's that I listen to a lot as well .
 If you like to listen to real music , buy this CD . Dino is an unbelievable pianist with incredible talent . Dino is a world class pianist trained at Julliard . My favorite songs were Wind Beneath My Wings , and Somewhere Out There/Somewhere Over The Rainbow . The arrangements are beautiful , and the music is not only piano music , but is combined with other instruments in his music to enhance it . Once you buy this CD you will find it hard to not want to hear the songs again . I promise .
 I studied pipe organ for many years at Penn State , Harvard and elsewhere . In my estimation -LRB- and that of many others , judging from internet newsgroups -RRB- Chapuis ' recording remains a first choice . Though recorded in 1968 , the sound is superb , as are the instruments . The playing is very spontaneous , revealing a love of playing . There seems to be minimal editing . It 's great that the set has been reissued , though it does not include the more recently discovered works ...
 I find Chapuis ' interpretations very convincing , and never `` rushed '' -LRB- cf. ethan b 's review below -RRB- . The Canonic Variations are unsurpassed , so different from the usual lethargic , disengaged or pedantic treatment . His playing is astonishing -- exciting , meditative , brilliant or serene , but always appropriate , always thoughtful and inspired . The engineering is another matter , but do n't let it deter you unless you are an audiophile first and a music-lover second .
 The United Archives -LRB- Red Box -RRB- set I purchased are the same wonderful recordings I acquired decades ago on Telefunken LP 's . Put simply , I consider this the best `` complete set '' , period . Yes , Chorzempa recorded a better Toccata & Fugue in d , And Biggs -LRB- can you believe it ? -RRB- did a better `` Little Fugue '' , but , overall , Chapuis is the King.A real plus is the inclusion of pieces like the `` Jig Fugue '' -LRB- BWV 577 -RRB- that are now considered to be spurious.The booklet is hardly more than a program list , but the music is pure treasure.Some advice
 At Michel Chapuis , you crazy man . You have to see a picture of this guy - -LSB- ... -RSB- - Anyway , herein lies a sensitive , masterful approach to the works without histrionics . More intellectual than Piet Kee but yet a pervading loveliness , if admittedly a bit cold in some of the slower passages . Chapuis transcends simply melodic passion , communicating clearly the wealth of polyphonic wisdom to us mere idiots without losing his humaneness . The reviewer who wanted the `` thundrous pedal notes '' to vibrate in his sound system probably did n't realize these recordings are made on really incredibly light and clear baroque organs , not the thicker-sounding , clumsier ones most people are used to . Not that I 'm an expert by any means but this is the only set of Bach organ works I 've found where the playing never sounds muddled . One can follow all of the lines without needing to refer to the music . If you 're looking to be awed by organ theatrics a la Hollywood zombie movies , this is n't the recording for you . But if you really want to hear Bach 's ideas and enjoy complex voice leading , this may be the best out there . Also , I have listened to this entire set and feel he does not race at all - even though he does get a bit excited in the fast parts , and does speed up SLIGHTLY , i think it works - the playing is always tremendously clear even then - in a jazz sense , and he is human after all , even if his brilliance might imply otherwise . It gives the excitement of a live performance , rather than the perfect things we 're getting used to on recordings . It could be a matter of taste , to be sure . But it is also true that different people track sounds and images at different speeds so perhaps the reviewer below is not able to follow at the same speed as the maestro .
 Raw & ballsy ... Jimmy at his best . Like no one else . He 'll rip your heart out and rock you out of any stupor you may be in . Get it and be amazed .
 The flute and guitar make an interesting and very enjoyable combination . Listening to these works , at least half of which should be fairly familiar , played by this instrumental duo is a most pleasant experience . There 's a sprightliness and a bounce to these performances that makes this a particularly attractive collection .
 The sweetness and sorrowness of Tango were expressed in such passionate yet reserved melody performed so freely by wonderful and magical talents of Ziegler and Erni . This is the perfect combination I 've ever experienced . No matter if you are a classical , jazz , or popular music lover , you 'll fall in love completely with this one !
 I was not a fan of The Streets . There 's a good reason for everything , and I believe the reason for this is because I never really gave it a good listen . That all changed with `` The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living '' because , quite simply , I ca n't stop listening ! In my ADD-ridden life , it 's tough for hip-hop to have any sort of lasting effect on me . Usually hip-hop albums get quite old , quite fast , at least for me . But I have been listening to this album for several weeks now and I plan to continue this for some time . Being a newcomer to The Streets , I am thoroughly amazed by how solid , clever , and brilliant this album is!Solid
 The Streets -LRB- Mike Skinner -RRB- is one of my favorite artists around . He 's very original , hard-to-categorize , and does n't sound like a lot of other hiphop acts.This CD is yet another solid album beginning to end . It 's not quite as good as A Grand ... , which was a great day-in-the-life-of concept album , but this one 's still great . I could see if you were a die-hard rap fan who only listened to rap , you might not like this guy.The Streets always covers diverse topics -LRB- ie , missing his dead dad -RRB- ; he 's one of the ` realest ' rappers out there , not afraid to reveal his emotions and personal life.The beats are actually decent , with more electro influences . The beats are still simple . The Streets is definitely not all about great beats ; it 's always been about Mike 's rapping/talking . Luckily that format has n't changed at all.This is a very solid album . My biggest complaint is that it 's too short at 11 songs 37 minutes long . Recommended to fans of his previous work .
 4 stars compared to all music2 .5 compared to previous Streets releases
 But it does n't quite recapture the originality of `` original pirate material '' . It opens , `` I get back from touringSuddenly it does n't seem like much fun to be off my faceAt a quarter to eleven am '' , and anyone who 's heard `` the streets '' older stuff will know that there 's something slightly offbeat from the older stuff . Personally , i was n't a fan of `` a grand dont come for free '' , and prefer this newer one to that . Skinner takes the concept behind `` a grand dont come for free '' , and manages to create an anecdotal concept album revolving around his entire career as the man behind `` the streets '' . Mike Skinner 's style has definetly changed since his first stuff found it 's way over to American shores , and the last track of `` the hardest way to make an easy living '' ends on a relatively light tone . The entire tone of this album is more mature , more developed than `` the streets '' older stuff . We get more reflection , less tales of drug inundated adventures on the streets of london . Whether this is a bad thing or a bad thing is still up in the air . `` The streets '' built it 's image around an ability to portray London 's drug and club culture first hand . I think this album is indicitative of good things to come . And i 'd recommend it .
 The Hardest Way to make an Easy Living is the third album from The Streets . The Streets is Mike Skinner ; one of the best rappers out there today . I only use the word ` rapper ' because ` hip hopper ' is more of what he is , but that doesnt sound as good . Either way you slice it hes among the best but you 've probably never heard of him . And now that may be because hes from the UK , but its more to do with the fact that the rap and hip hop scenes are dominated by names like 50 Cent or Chingy -LRB- coincidentally the sound 50 cents makes in ones pocket -RRB- . Rappers who-while not exclusively-rap about bitches , hoes , guns , getting shot , ice , rims etc. etc. . The Streets first album Original Pirate Material was a breath of fresh air to those weary of such things . A fusion of different sounds with savvy witty and truthful lyrics , ranging from drug us to political topics about ... drug use . Its beats were good but ... a bit home-brewed . There was a roughness to them , which was good because it suited the style of the album . The sound was a good mixture of electronica and hip hop.His second album A Grand Dont Come For Free was an engaging narrative through the span of 24 hours which include songs ranging from inter-personal relationships , trust , drug use and repetitive living , its a major step up in terms of production value . While some praised Mike for hisn ` raw ' sound on Pirate Material , it was a major gripe with some that it wasnt consistent . A Grand had much more focus , it showed an evolution from the lyrics and lyric structure we had heard before . I consider it his best album to date.The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living is his newest album and shows a fusion of the first two albums . Its funnier and more fanciful than A Grand while retaining a crispness of sound Pirate Material lacked . Theres an emphasis on hooks and thats not a bad thing because the whole of the songs are excellent and not RELIANT on the hooks . While some deride Mike for going the way of Eminem and having his third album be about life after success , what is there to do ? Hes found success and for the most its kept him in the same place to write the same type of lyrics and songs . But it allows him to pull back and show his view of the industry hes now a bigger part of . Its also allowed him to compare where he was and where he is , so while hes still more or less the same man from Original Pirate Material hes now a man who can reflect on losing and finding A Grand , and talk about dating celebrities . A solid work , hes over the sophomore slump and staying strong .
 It 's the third chapter for Mike Skinner , the biggest pop star from the UK . Almost every album has been a number one if I remember right . The last album was a concept album . This album is more about the spoils of success . It 's less unfocused than the previous two . `` War of The Sexes '' reminds me of some of the songs on the first album . Some immediate favorites are `` When You Was n't Famous '' and `` Hotel Expressionism . '' The first is about the pitfalls of become a well known act . The second is about ? Not sure . Maybe about destroying hotels ? `` Never Went To Church '' explores to two great European narcotics
 His first two Streets albums made him hot property , but with third record The Hardest Way To Make An Easy Living chav hero Mike Skinner shows that the life of music star is n't all it 's cracked up to be . From the opening lines of Pranging Out -LRB- ` I get back off tour and suddenly it does n't seem so much fun to be off my face at quarter to 11am ' -RRB- through to When You Was n't Famous -LRB- ` How the hell am I supposed to be able to do a line in front of complete strangers when they 've all got cameras ' -RRB- , there 's an air of paranoia , betrayal and regret on Skinner 's latest outing that clashes with his earlier odes to brandy , birds and big nights out . Even so , the warm keyboards of Pranging Out , the choir of miscreants on Never Went To Church and passionate but yowly Two Nations -LRB- a tribute originally meant for Notorious BIG 's Duets album but rejected due to unsympathetic lines such as ` we gave you John Lennon , even though you shot him as well ' -RRB- ensure that The Hardest Way is an accessible album in spite of Skinner lyrically beating himself up about his materialism and shallow relationships in stanzas that stop just short of a surrogate suicide note.Although final song Fake Streets Hats ends the album with a whimper rather than a bang , the title track acts as a towering highlight . Incorporating harpsichord backing like The Stranglers ' Golden Brown reinvented for gamblers , it is one of the songs where Skinner 's humour outweighs his fears.Streets ahead , yet again .
 before i heard this album i thought it was n't going to be as good as the others due to the fact that most people i spoke with had negative comments but i completely disagree . this album is AMAZING ! just as spectacular as the other two , they 're all so great that i ca n't say any one of them is any better than the rest . its got a nice mix of serious songs such as `` never went to church '' which people say sell him out but thats just garbage . he 's an incredible lyricist and wrote it as a memorium for his old man so why would you go and disrespect him in his choice for making it a single , good choice mike skinner , well respected . his songs about messing around are hilarious but those personal/serious songs are absolutely amazing as well and very touching even though he 's just a prankster . look , just go pick it up along with the rest of them , its great music for a great time and always lifts your spirts.great work skinner , ca n't wait for your next album and hope it comes out sonner than i know it will
 Excellent album after a few listens . Love the concept of how Brits `` invented the language '' not us Yanks so do n't tell us Brits how to speak . : - -RRB- Each album has been different , and that shows artistic development -LRB- not that Mike Skinner needed to prove that to me -RRB- . Would be nice to have some Grime or Drum 'n' Bass remixes to play in the clubs . How bout it Mikey ?
 i think that this cd comes in last when put up next to a grand dont come for free and original pirate material . that said , i still love this cd . i think the best tracks are `` war of the sexes '' and `` pranging out '' . but if you only have enough money to buy one of the streets cds , i 'd go with A grand do n't come for free
 Ive been lookin forward to this album for a while and i was n't disapointed when i got it . Mike skinner talks about his life which us English lads can relate to because he goes through what we go through but he has got the talent to produce music and write lyrics about it . He aint trying to rap cuz how could he with without a american accent ? he just got his own style which is very english but puts his views on life across brilliantly !!!
 My first The Streets album . Funny , edgy , funky , poignant , cool , warm . Word art and music blended to taste . My taste .
 If you 're wondering how a British rap act could be considered enjoyable to an American audience , then you need to a -RRB- start reading Pitchfork , b -RRB- stop only downloading music from the top ten list on iTunes , and c -RRB- LOSE YOUR OLD PREJUDICES , which is something everyone in today 's society needs to more of anyway.For those willing to broaden their horizons -LRB- and for those curious as to what the hype for `` The Streets '' is all about -RRB- , listening to `` The Streets '' is a huge step in the right direction , though THE HARDEST WAY TO MAKE AN EASY LIVING is n't the best album to start off with.If you really want to be a smart consumer , you 'll want to start by checking out `` The Streets ' '' first album ORIGINAL PIRATE MATERIAL then their second album A GRAND DO N'T COME FOR FREE before buying THE HARDEST WAY TO MAKE AN EASY LIVING . Sure , you 'll be buying more music this way , but it 's worth it for the fact that you 're broadening your music horizons and for the personal delight that you enjoy music your friends -LRB- probably -RRB- have no idea exists . `` The Streets '' is Mike Skinner , a British MC with a heavy accent and an appreciation for a variety of sounds , from two-step to techno . ORIGINAL PIRATE MATERIAL succeeded in mixing a variety of sounds into a completely original sonic palette of computerized percussions , orchestra flourishes and electro-sampling . Skinner 's second album , A GRAND DO N'T COME FOR FREE , is less sonically diverse , but provides a more complete listening experience because the entire album is one long narrative of one or two days in the life of Mike Skinner.THE HARDEST WAY TO MAKE AN EASY LIVING takes a departure from A GRAND 's album-length narrative , though remnants of that album exist on this one . The production is crisper and easier on the ears here in comparison to ORIGINAL PIRATE MATERIAL and A GRAND , and it lets the hooks and melodies -LRB- which are as good here as they ever were -RRB- take more prominence.Besides the more focused production , the emphasis on hooks and choruses differentiates this album for the rest of the albums in `` The Streets ' '' catalogue.Lead single and best song on the album , `` When You Was n't Famous , '' is a hooky , witty , fun song full of as much self-referential humor as the rest of `` The Streets ' '' catalogue.Long-time fans will be disappointed that Skinner seems to take less risks this time around . Some of the best moments on ORIGINAL PIRATE MATERIAL were the catchy segue-songs such as `` Sharp Darts '' and `` Geezer 's Need Excitement '' found buried within the rest of the album . Experiments such as there are nowhere to be found on THE HARDEST WAY TO MAKE AN EASY LIVING . Also , the obvious flaw of this album to those who have been following the career of Mike Skinner is that this album is written from the perspective of someone who 's made it in the industry and even become famous , which is opposite of what ORIGINAL PIRATE MATERIAL was all about . But when you separate the music of THE HARDEST WAY TO MAKE AN EASY LIVING with the external circumstances of Skinner 's career , what 's left is an album as engaging and memorable as anything else Skinner has done.If you think you 're ready to experiment with new types of music , `` The Streets '' might be too far of a leap to start off with , but eventually -LRB- and hopefully -RRB- you 'll be able to appreciate The Streets for being one of this century 's most original artists . Deal with the fact that the best music being produced today is n't exactly the music that sells the most , deal with the fact that `` The Streets '' is British , deal with the fact that music is n't confined to one genre or formula , and your appreciation for music will forever be changed.BEST TRACKS
 I would place The Streets ' `` Original Pirate Material '' in my top 25 albums of all time . It was an instant classic , marked by a refreshing , creative delivery , brilliant lyrics , and filthy , dirty garage beats courtesy of the UK 's up-and-coming `` grime '' scene . The second album , however , was a flop . Spare a few good tracks , I could n't listen to it and certainly could n't play it all the way through . It appeared that Streets main man Mike Skinner had folded under the pressure of the media hype machine . I decided to give him one more album to either prove his worth to me or to fall under the category of `` Spin Magazine Hipster Trash '' , with artists such as The Arcade Fire , Bright Eyes , and other such artists that are more famous for their `` in-scene '' hype rather than their musical merits . Well , the verdict is in , and The Streets are pretty much the real deal . Although this album does n't top `` Original Pirate Material '' -LRB- probably nothing Skinner ever does will -RRB- , it is light years ahead of the lukewarm `` A Grand Do n't Come For Free '' . The beats are mainly outrageous , such as on album trump card `` War of the Sexes '' and the opener `` Pranging Out '' , and the brilliant lyrics are back as well ; `` All Goes Out The Window '' , `` Ca n't Con an Honest John '' , and `` War of The Sexes '' are all either outstanding tales or brilliant pieces of humorous advice . First single `` When You Was n't Famous '' recaps Mikes recent adventures with cocaine in the public eye , and `` The Art of Hotel Expressionism '' is a satirical song about being a big star . Although Mike seems to have somewhat gotten back on track , this album is hampered by the same problems that the last one was ; Mike 's delivery is extremely poor and he has n't been the same since the debut . His delivery has deteriorated into what The Streets original detractors thought it was ; a joke . He screams over the beats and his voice is way too loud in the mix . On OPM , his vocals were low-key and his lyrics normally did the talking . On `` A Grand Do n't Come For Free '' and somewhat on `` The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living '' , Mike sounds really doofy in some parts where he is talking nonsense way too loud over the beat and completely interrupting the flow of the song . Many fans claim this is `` creative '' and `` the way it is supposed to be '' , but from a musical standpoint it really ruins some great songs . I dealt with it a little bit on OPM , but it has gotten out of control . Mike , cut it out . Despite its flaws , `` Easy Living '' is a great album and everything `` A Grand Do n't Come For Free '' should have been.Original Pirate Material - ***** A Grand Do n't Come For Free - ** The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living - ****
 I 'm a writer and a skeptic . The first morning that I put this CD on and started the coffee maker , I thought , `` I do n't even care for this type of music . '' But , by the time I was ready to sit at my desk , I was more alert than usual . It 's the strangest thing . I do n't know how it works , but it does .
 I have listened for years to slightly `` doctored '' classic music to enhance concentration , focus , and relaxation . I find these tapes worked very well for me even when I was writing/editing long narratives such as grants , etc. . I do not like a lot of `` new age '' music , I tend to find it too spacey - it 's ok when you are getting a massage , but not okay for staying focused , yet relaxed on a time-consuming project . I wondered if I would like this CD and if it would work . I like all the tracks well enough to listen to all of them and , at the beginning of the day or work session , I find listening to them in sequence helps me find a very productive state of mind . Once I get going , though , I tend to listen only to the second half of the disk . I would definitely recommend this CD , especially to writers .
 I got this after I got the sleeping and relaxation CDs by this guy -LRB- my doctor recommended it to me -RRB- and I think it helps me work . The only thing that you need to do is use it consistently . This is the hardest part of it , if I start listening to rock and other things I have a hard time changing to this play list . If I start with this and stick with it I can really tell a difference , once again you have to do it for awhile and consistently to notice anything . You do not need to listen to it in order or all of the songs.One last note , this is all in personal preference . If you find this music intolerably boring , this most likely not work for you . If it is not that bad to you , then I think it can help .
 I love this CD ! I listen to it at work and it really helps me to concentrate .
 I found the music on this CD helped me to focus on doing chores around the house . It keeps me going until the task is done , so I 'm more productive when I listen to this CD . However , when I need to concentrate on tasks that involves a lot of brain work , I prefer listening to instrumental classical crossover music instead of this CD . Most of the pieces seems to have a rhythm which I guess should help the brain stay alert and move forward , but since I have really sensitive hearing , sometimes it 's a bit overwhelming to my ears . That said , this CD may work for those whose ears are not as sensitive as mine . Everybody is different so just because it does n't work for me in a specific way does n't mean it wo n't work for others.This is the first CD I bought that actually came with listening instructions ; that 's why I always prefer buying the CD than just download the music -LRB- audio quality is another issue why I wo n't download -RRB- . The music is quite pleasant so I also listen to it when I want to relax without falling asleep .
 I work in a small doctor 's office and we have to have music . I find music distracting while I am working . But I have to admit music does fill a void in our high ceilinged , wood enhanced century old building . This CD is perfect and not distracting . It is not new age and it is not easy listening , it is perfect . I am going to download other CDs from Sonicaid .
 This album has the song `` Penelope '' , which was recommended to me because that is my name . Good album .
 When Jimi took the stage at Woodstock to play this set , most of the crowd had left -LRB- down from 400,000 to 25,000 -RRB- . The farm on which the concert was staged was now a barren wasteland that consisted of any soggy piece of anything the hippies in attendance did n't want to haul back to their current home.Jimi took this mess and turned it into a living legend . When he took the stage he did n't even get a proper introduction , but undaunted , launched into a powerful reading of `` Message to Love '' which , for the most part was a preview of the rest of the show.There were some problems though , neither Jimi nor his closest bandmates , Mitch Mitchell or Billy Cox really liked the expanded format -LRB- which not only included Cox on bass and Mitchell on drums , but two percussionists and a rythym guitarist -RRB- . This , is only minor problem though , as neither precussionist is audible due to inadequate miking and the sound of Jimi 's guitar.The worst part , though , is definatly the editing of the rythym guitarist Lary Lee 's two solo peices , `` Gypsy Woman '' and another that the name of which escapes me . I mean , neither disc was even 70 minutes , that means that even if the two songs were ten minutes both could have -LRB- and should have -RRB- been included . I mean they dismised it as filler and admitted to it in the linear notes but what is so hard about putting on two more tracks ? I 'm not saying that Lee is some guitar god , but he was part of the band , and part of the Woodstock legend too . All hope of the complete preformance is n't lost , however , as you can obtain the full set with no editing -LRB- and all of the songs -RRB- on the internet.Over all , great playing , great step up from the previous Woodstock disc , little or no fake cheering , and almost complete . Great buy , no matter what I said .
 This 2 CD set adds previously unreleased versions of ` Message To Love ' , ` Spanish Castle Magic ' , ` Lover Man ' and ` Foxy Lady ' to the preceding single CD release -LRB- simply titled ` Woodstock ' -RRB- , but it 's still not complete
 Few performances have become quite as legendary as Hendrix and the Gypsy Sun and Rainbows on that muddy Monday morning at Woodstock , and rightfully so . Sure there were other great performances at Woodstock -LRB- Santana , the Who , Janis Joplin ... -RRB- , but none was more electrifying then the Band of Gypsys , not even the shock that the tens of thousands in attendance would have felt , had the rain hit those wires just right.Unfortunately the Woodstock concert was never well compiled , appearing in poorly mixed , out of order , sloppy compilations . Even the latest Woodstock disc suffers from editing problems , the well documented almost complete absense of guitarist Larry Lee -LRB- though in the times when we hear him , he is a clear talent -RRB- percussionist Jerry Velez and Juma Sultan , not to mention it is still out of order.However , this will only disturb the most ardent of Hendrix fans . The rest of us -LRB- most notably those that did n't get to see Woodstock live -RRB- are only concerned with getting our Hendrix in extreme doses . And Hendrix delivers , playing with unprecedented soul and fury . From the first note of Message to Love , pop these dics -LRB- the first two disc collection of Hendrix 's Woodstock performance -RRB- in and watch your CD player smoke . The concert hits its peak when Hendrix blazes through a stirring , feedback , guitar pyrotechnic filled , instrumental version of The Star Spangled Banner , -LRB- Sure beats the version with lyrics by several football stadiums -RRB- which then segues into a stunning Purple Haze . And I have n't mentioned the funk injected into a nearly 14 minute Voodoo Child -LRB- Slight Return -RRB- or the passion and nervous energy of Fire ! Nor have I said anything about all the other wonderful guitar jams.I would take all day if I were to bring up all the great aspects of the Woodstock show . All I can say is that this is guitar playing at its peak , bar none . No fan of rock deserves to be called a rock fan until they own a Hendrix album . This is n't a bad place to start . Sure many aspects of this show are edited out . But Hendrix is not . And it is Hendrix that makes Live at Woodstock essential to everyone 's rock and roll collection !
 Jimi Hendrix live at woodstock remains as one of the most influential live albums in history . This entire 2 CD set includes the entire woodstock performence remastered . The band Gypsy Suns And Rainbows was alittle off but on this CD they cut off most of the musicians who did not fit the picture except for Billy Cox , Mitch Mitchell , and Jimi Hendrix . All of the songs are truely amazing from the start to the finish my favorite songs included most of the jams . If you want to really hear a great live Jimi Hendrix album then I Highly Recomend this one for you . Enjoy !
 This 2-CD title is the release of Jimi 's entire set he played at the historic music festival . It was previously put out as a single disc , so there are several tracks that either I never heard of or I simply do n't remember . Like `` Izabella '' and `` Villanova Junction '' . The tunes that grab your full attention would be `` Message Of Love '' , `` Spanish Castle Magic '' -LRB- one of my personal Hendrix favorites -RRB- , `` Foxey Lady '' , `` Hey Joe '' , `` Fire '' , `` Red House '' , `` Purple Haze '' and the famed `` Star Spangled Banner '' . This would make a GREAT gift .
 ` Live at Woodstock ' is a great showcase of Jimi playing live . This was the first outing with this line up and you can tell in the freshness and rawness of the music . The best way to describe it would be loose , the playing is very loose and free and different to other Hendirx live albums i 've heard . As a kid I never really ` got ' the Woodstock version of ` The Star Spangled Banner ' , but as i 've gotten older and definitely hearing it in context with the complete concert , I really understand the power behind taking a traditional , sacred -LRB- to Americans -RRB- piece of national music , deconstructing it and then rebuilding it in a new and mind blowing way . You 'd have to hear it to see what I mean . This is a great performance and shows Jimi 's unique and moving talent . The selection of songs are pretty great and you can get some feel for the audience atmosphere . Well worth a try if you 're a fan of Jimi and want a piece of music history.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page .
 Well , the Hendrix Vinyl journey continues and I just cracked open the 3LP Woodstock Album from MCA last night.Wow again and again . The music speaks for itself . Jimi was in good spirits and although the band was a bit clunky , the ` extras in the band ' that is , this was a very enjoyable concert . Sound quality is damned Fine !! The pressings are very quiet andare on center , unlike some of the first Hendrix LP 's I got a few months ago . It does seem that whomever is pressingthe latest Experience Hendrix Vinyl is not keeping a judicious eye on Quality . But it 's not just them , I bought the 10Mono Dylan set from Sundazed records last week and out of the ten titles , a whoppin 5 of them are pressed ` OffCenter enough that you can hear the pitch in the music go fast and slow !! -LRB- that 's a 50 % failure rate folks !! -RRB- So althoughthis revitalized market for Vinyl , and especially ` Audiophile ' vinyl is very healthy right now , the manufacturing part ofit is pretty bunk . But again , these slightly older Hendrix ` MCA ' pressings seem to be of excellent quality , both in audioquality -LRB- 1st rate remastering , although I do n't know if it 's ` all analog ' , but it 's soooooo goood that I ca n't really see anybig improvement in the newest ` all analog ' releases ! -RRB- , and Pressing quality . So , I 'm going after the older MCA 's whiletheir still available at some ridiculously low prices ! -LRB- I got the 3LP Woodstock from ` Oldies.com ' for $ 24 !! -RRB- Happy Listening !!

 a must for everybody . Three days of peace and music coming to an end and what better way to close than with the legendary Jimi Hendrix ? The first performance of the band of gypsies . You will love it from the moment Jimi is presented till the last chord of Hey Joe climaxing with the star spangled banner known to millions as one of the greatest day in the history of pop music . After you 've heard it , you might want to see it but what the hell !
 This is Jimi 's most famous performance , maybe since its included in the most famous concert ever . Still , there are better concerts of Jimi than this one . It takes him and the band almost all of disc one to warm up . On Red house , Larry Lee plays the lead guitar , so believe me , any other live version of Red House is better than this one . But just as the concert is near its end , Jimi starts playing Star Splanged banner and makes everything worthwile . This is one of rock most memorable moments , one of those that youll have stuck in your mind no matter what , like Elvis playing Ed Sullivan , or the Beatles coming to America . So , from that track till the end of CD2 youll hear nothing but some of the best music ever recorded . Now , if you can get the Monterrey CD on a second hand shop , that is Jimi 's best performance ever . Or get Band of gipsys instead .
 I almost fainted when I heard Hendrix Live at Woodstocd digitally remastered . It must have been 100 times better than the original Woodstock . Let me tell you , Woodstock I feel was the best Hendrix concert given . It was completely incredible the way he played . If you can buy only one Hendrix CD , this is definetly the one to get . I must have listened to this CD 1,000 times . I am telling you the truth .
 This CD has it all , Hendrix at woodstock is a must for all hendrix fans and fans of great music . Classics such as `` The Star Spangled banner '' `` Villanova Junction '' and `` Voodoo Chile '' -LRB- Slight return -RRB- This album absolutely soars !
 Hardly anything was edited from this superior album and the way that jimi leaves the distortion in woodstock improvisation and moves on to an almost Catalan guitar solo is beautiful .
 A good edit . Buy this CD and PURPLE HAZE IN WOODSTOCK as well . That way you will have all the unedited versions as well as the cleaned up takes . Edit both sets together and Viola ! you have an -LSB- almost -RSB- complete version of the festival set
 Great music from Jimi and the boys.One thing-I distinctly remember a Mitch Mitchell drum solo.Furthermore , where is that other guitar player?And the congas or bongos -LRB- or whatever-can ' t be sure -RRB- ? Why try and remake history?Sheesh ... music biz people-can ' t leave well alone.Nevertheless , a must for serious Hendrix fans and collectors .
 Heard it at a friends place and it litrally gave me a kick.Is a must for all JIMI fans.Not heard JIMI - still I think you got to.Wish I could have heard him play.I and a lot of my friends back here in India love it .
 Live at Woodstock was great for Jimi Hendrix , but as far as his Gypsy Sun & Rainbows Band including Juma Sultan on percussion , Larry Lee on rhythm guitar , and Jerry Velez on percussion they where way out of key as far as sound wise . Mitch Mitchell , Billy Cox , and Jimi Hendrix played great together that very last day of Woodstock . This is truely a great performence including the entire set unlike the video Woodstock . Their are endless jams on this one including Message To Love running seven minutes and twenty one seconds wow ! Hear My Train A Comin running 9:49 , Spanish Castle Magic 7:05 , and Jam Back At The House running 7:44 wow a great jam band.Then second set is just as great with a great performence of Voodoo Chile -LRB- slight return -RRB- running 13:40 -RRB- . I also loved the jams titled Woodstock Improvisation , and Villanova Junction . The funny thing about the whole concert is the last song which is in my book the worst song titled Hey Joe other than that last song this performence is really good just with the three members . Larry Lee lacks being in tune for the whole concert they really cut him out on this recording the only song you really can hear his out of tune guitar is on Spanish Castle Magic . Their is a huge booklet included with the CD that explains the whole story behind the woodstock legacy . This is truely a must have Jimi Hendrix live concert !
 I have just finished reading all the reviews listed , and I was amazed at the amount of criticism directed towards Eddie Kramer . The work he did with this recording is astounding . I have heard the raw recordings from Woodstock , and Kramer has literally saved the only essential parts of this performance . Jimi Hendrix WAS the performance , and nothing else matters . This release is without doubt , the definitive `` live '' Hendrix performance . It is a testimonial to generations to come , that Jimi Hendrix was truly THE MASTER of his instrument . His comand of the guitar is awe-inspiering , and his genuine love of his music is completely contagious . This is an absolute must for music fans everywhere ; in this time , and in all the time yet to come .
 Who am I to comment on the poetry of the Angels ? Me , a mere mortal , an unholy , absurd wretch of a soul . How dare such a filthy turd as myself dream of scavenging the words that , at best , merely hint at the Aural Miracle that is offered here . But I vainly persist ... On that August Monday morning of '69 a haggard , sodden horde found themselves awash in a roiling cascade of fathomless sonics . The dwindling throng , the lingering faithful , were ritualistically cleansed by Astronomically Groovy Monster Waves of Pure Electric Soul . A Cosmic Baptism . `` Woodstock '' has assumed the mantle of a tired cliche ; a fading symbol of both the surprising potential of our nation 's youth , and our yet-unredeemed hopes for profound social change . The festival 's memory is encumbered by the weight of four decades of unrepentant Idolatry and obsessive Mythology.Myths , it seems , fulfill that odd cultural need to reassure ourselves in our doubtful belief that We Belong Here , that we are forever needing to be reminded that we have a Divine Right to be at any one particular place at any one particular moment . Jimi 's astonishing creations passionately remind us that this is a FALSE need , for we ALL Belong not just HERE but EVERYWHERE , because EVERYBODY already is EVERYWHERE . Spiritually , Jimi declares , we ALL have always been , and always will be , ENTITLED TO EVERYTHING , EQUALLY . That 's why when I listen to this CD I know HE is still here ... and there ... and here ... But people are prone to fits of ego preening and this is manifested in the indignant barking and bitching over this collection 's perceived shortcomings . Some find it unpardonable that Larry Lee 's 2 featured numbers are omitted or that his rhythm guitar is unheard on other cuts . Perhaps these are valid concerns in worlds ruled by absolute precision and slavish attention to minor detail . The rabid purists take pride in their fury , forgetting that Jimi himself was extremely unsatisfied with his unresolved fledgling formation . He disbanded this lineup almost immediately after the festival , returning to the proven 2 man rhythm section that had served him so well previously . If it 's dutiful commitment to meaningless routine and hollow ceremony that 's engorging the critical elite , then they should take another listen with open ears and passive mind to what IS offered here . It 's so much better than they want to believe . The edits are inconsequential , the omissions are forgivable , even reasonable . If your intent is to reveal that Jimi Hendrix is fallible , a mere mortal who erred greatly in assembling this particular lineup , then insisting on the inclusion of inferior material that the artist himself was dissatisfied with just seems to me to be vindictive . Your pride in knowing that something is being denied you , no matter how trivial , overshadows your better senses.So if `` others '' conspired to contaminate Jimi 's legacy , by altering , deleting , maiming , butchering his art , that would be sad . If we believe we 've been duped we may allow our prideful indignation to obliterate our joy . It may seem that I am being contradictory , but by emphasizing the debatable negative aspects of this production you do yourselves and Jimi 's spirit a great disservice . That some of this `` live '' event has been modified is perhaps less than ideal , but do n't let this minor fact drown your love of special music . What remains here , what we ARE given to behold is in fact remarkable , magical , transcendent . So , words are feeble tools in the service of exalting the miracle of Jimi 's Sublime Gift . Perhaps it 's better expressed by A Forty Year Smile on the Collective Face of All who witnessed , two generations later still radiating pearly white and wide .
 A nice collection of Hendrix highlights from Woodstock ... not too many of these sort of Woodstock Highlights for individual artists exist to my knowledge ... this one is a real keeper .
 What is so amazing about Jimi Hendrix playing a set of explosive material to 25,000 burnt out flower children ? I 'll tell you ... he kept the band 's verve through the disappointment of a terrible spot in the lineup ... Imagine if Hendrix went on during one of the more explosive days or evenings of the 3 day event , instead of the time slot he was relegated to ... last day , everyone wandering homeward ... 25K left , picking through the rubble looking for discarded food , clothes or a freebie.But Jimi Hendrix pulled it off , rallied the band , putting his strat through the paces and committing to film and acetate an explosive , thoroughly intensive set of released , soon to be released and never to be released -LRB- except for this effort -RRB- material . I wonder if was the Airborne training ? Train , Train Train -LRB- or rehease or jam or whatever -RRB- ... so that as Coach Vince Lombardi once said ... the harder you train , the harder it is to give up ! Play on ! Perform ! Whatever the case may be .
 My boyfriend loved it ! He 's a huge Jimi Henderix fan so I got it for him for Christmas and he loved it !
 Why not 5 stars ? The hum , which was a result of the limited recording equipment/techniques from 1969 . Otherwise this is a great collection of live Hendrix .
 Great jams . I am a blues listener and Jimi was tuned right in to the blues . Great stuff . I really enjoy the riffs .
 This is another must have for Hendrix fans . Always sounds better on an lp of course ! The grand master of guitar .
 The one thing I 'm not quite sure is why on amazon it says that Jimi Hendrix
 Growing up in the early 70 's the only songs available from Jimi at Woodstock were ` Star Spangled Banner ' followed by ` Purple Haze ' . The opinion of myself and most other Hendrix fans was that it was ` not one of his best performances ' . Now with the CD -LRB- and more importantly the DVD -RRB- of the entire performance , along with the story behind his ` new band ' rehearsing in a house in Woodstock NY , it is seen and heard in a whole new light.I have to say that this is one of -LRB- if not the best -RRB- show ever recorded by Jimi . As well known in his unreleased recordings -LRB- and of course the famous ` Band Of Gypsies -RRB- This is the REAL Jimi , expressing his own Art without outside interference from the British ` Jimi Hendrix Experience ' and the corporation surrounding it , we see and hear what direction Limi was going , and who knows how far he would have taken it if not for his untimely death . Even ` Electric Ladyland ' was pointing in a new direction . So , I give this one an excellent review as a 5 star product , and a must have for any die-hard Hendrix fans !
 Sound Quality - For a live performance from '69 this sounds great . I 'm sure the 180g vinyl helps . I have heard some of my friends live audience Hendrix tapes and the quality is horrible.Album Design - Great artwork , nice photos , good narrative -LRB- I did n't realize the band was in transition at this point and there were only 2 rehearsals before Woodstock -RRB- Performance - very good performance for 9AM . nice interpretations of the old songs.Pressing - nice job on the production . looks like a high quality job . I cleaned them before playing them and picked up no dirt . very clean out of the sleeve .
 I agree that this was n't the best Hendrix band . On some tracks you can hear the bass player struggling to find his place . However ! When I heard this as a kid it changed my life . At the end he plays purple haze and that goes into a lot of Phrygian jam stuff . If it had stopped there it was not legendary . But then he goes right into `` Villanova Junction '' or as I knew as a kid `` untitled . '' It 's a minor blues form . This is one of the most beautiful , sensitive things I have ever heard on electric guitar -LRB- Santana 's `` Samba pa ti '' and Page 's Since I been loving you are great too -RRB- . His phrasing , ideas , and touch are unmatched . I assumed it was something he made up on the spot but I ran into a rare vinyl called `` Nine to the Universe '' where he plays something similar . After spending the rest of my life as a musician I still think Hendrix and this track are fantastic . some other hidden gems are `` Pali Gap '' , `` Hear my train a coming '' , `` Golden Rose '' -LRB- which is overlooked because of the fantastic tracks surrounding it -RRB-
 Before I bought this album , I would consider myself a nominal Jimi Hendrix fan . Like most people , I appreciated such tracks as Purple Haze , Fire , etc. . After this album I was not the same person I was before . Jimi 's performance at Woodstock has to go down as one of the most historic events in music history . My most memorable moment would have to be the sequence of the `` Star Spangled Banner '' immediately followed by `` Purple Haze . '' The manner in which he managed to transition those two songs , is nothing short of mezmorizing . I highly recommend this album , even with the few faults that some other reviewers have mentioned -LRB- which are n't even noticed because you are so enmeshed in the beauty of his guitar -RRB- . YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT !!! Like most Hendrix recording his music gave me A NEW SENSE OF ARTISTIC EXPRESSION .
 This is a fantastic record , and a definite must for any Jimi-aholic or aspiring fan . It 's known by most that although the Hendrix studio albums were fantastic , to get the real Jimi , you have to listen live . And live this is , although I was a little dissapointed by two things
 By 1969 the whole hippie thing was starting to fade but this was the last gathering of all of them at WOODSTOCK This is hendrix at woodstock . This to me is a histroical concert ecspecially during Jimis electrifying star spangled banner which really defined what america was going thru at that time this album rocks it has voodo chilid with jimi playing it with his teeth -LRB- AMAZING -RRB- this album litterlay proves that jimi hendrix is the greatest guitarist of all time . This is hendrix at his best in concert rock onR.I.P . JIMI HENDRIX
 I do n't really have to write this review , because if you did n't know that Jimi Hendrix is THE most phenomenal guitar player in history , then you would n't be on this page right now . 5 stars ? Is that all I can give this ? I guess that 'll have to work for now .
 This is a great CD . Easily one of the best live recordings out there of anyone . My parents were n't even married when Woodstoock happened , and still this is great music for today and for those who think that just because it 's old always means it 's bad . Buy it .
 No doubt , everyone complains about the lack of hearing Larry Lee 's guitars and the congos . But , there 's a reason for that ... once jimi introduced the band , he cranked up the amp and let it go ... Besides the band was underrehersed , and i serious doubts that Lee was used to keeping up with jimi 's pace ...
 the hendrix family continues to do a wonderful job of re-issuing jimi 's music . awesome sound , terrific liner notes , great artwork . the hendrix catalogue was a disgrace for 25 years but it is now in the right hands . i would highly , very highly , recommend not only this release but all of the releases on `` experience hendrix '' records . now if they could only gain control of neil young 's back catalogue ...
 Audiophiles , take note . This Hendrix/Woodstock CD finally delivers full-range sound ; clear high end to solid , punchy bottom . Much better than the Alan Douglas effort of a few years back . Eddie Kramer has done a pretty miraculous job with these notoriously bad multi-track masters . You wo n't find a better sounding presentation of Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock . And no , Janie Hendrix did n't pay me to say that . When something 's good , it 's good -- whether you like the producers or not .
 Now that a double dvd of Jimi 's Woodstock gig has been released , remixed by Eddie Kramer -LRB- including a 5.1 surround mix -RRB- , there 's not much need for this CD , especially since the dvd set is cheaper . Just beware that the older single dvd release bears the same title as the new one ; `` Live At Woodstock '' .
 It was not what was in the water or in the air or what happened at Yasger 's that weekend . It was what was in Jimi Hendrix in 1969 that makes this a classic concert.Beleive it or not , the master himself was not quite sure . He knew he was a musician and not a showman , and he thus broke up his Experiance in late 1968 . He was going back to straight blues , but he was talking about working with Miles Davis . He was jamming with John Mcglaughlan . He was jamming with Larry Young . He was jamming with Traffic . Basically , working with as many master musicians he could find , soaking up context and ideas.This is where Hendrix was the morning of that concert . His large , loose ensamble , Electric Sky Church , jammed with him on straight blues tracks like `` Hear My Train ' A Commin , ' and `` Red House , `` But they were also cuttiing , and cutting hard and heavy , a path to the future . Listen to the angular time cuts of `` Back At The House -- Beginnings '' where Hendrix weaves a complex rhythm pattern far more complicated than anything on the Experiance albums.It is funk and blues and jazz . And if it sounds like a patch work , so what ! How often does a genius open his sketchbook and let you look . Hendrix is working out the new music in front of a mass audiance , and that takes guts . Who knows where he would have taken these ideas . To Miles , George Clinton ? Who can say?But either way , the show sounds great . If we never got to really hear those Beginnings finished , at least we have the Beginnings themselves .
 Jimi Hendrix was such a great song writer and guitar player . When he played woodstock he was at the peek of his career he was doing alot of amazing things in 69 . Jimi Hendrix came on stage and said '' Dig , we 'd like to get something straight . We got tired of the Experience ... It was blowin ' our minds . So we decided to change the whole thing around , and call it Gypsy Sun and Rainbows . Or short , it 's nothin ' but a Band of Gypsys . '' The Jimi Hendrix Experience broke up not to long before Hendrix played woodstock . Hendrix at this point wanted to try something more differnt for woodstock and he did but the band just did not work out as good as Hendrix thought . The band set-up for woodstock included Jimi Hendrix on guitar , Billy Cox on bass , Mitch Mitchell on drums , Juma Sultan on percussion , Larry Lee on rythem guitar , and Jerry Velez on percussion . The band played a differnt set list that night they started out with Message To Love then went into Hear My Train A Comin ' . Latter on Hendrix performed the highlight of the night Star Spangled Banner into Purple Haze . The band closed the night with Hey Joe then left the stage closing Woodstock 69 . I think this is one of the best performences Hendrix was truely on top . This CD includes a huge booklet with rare pictures from that evening at Woodstock . This is worth 5 stars this is truely a must have for the Hendrix fans . Enjoy !
 If you think you have heard Jimi Hendrix , you are only part right , if you have never heard this C.D.Every song I heard was like experiencing Hendrix for the first time.The raw unabashed power and soulfulness of Voodoo Chile will blow your socks off . The Star Bangled Banner is still one of Jimi 's most haunting guitar works.If you only buy one Hendrix C.D. 's this is it.Long live the crown prince of ROCK & ROLL.At least in our hearts and minds .
 Live At Woodstock -LRB- 1969 -RRB- . The Jimi Hendrix Experience 's Live Performance at 1969 's Woodstock.After the legendary previous performances at 1969 's Woodstock , which included bands like Sly , the Family Stone , The Who , Santana , Joe Cocker , and the newly minted Crosby , Stills , and Nash , at 9 ' O Clock on August 18th , 1969 , the Jimi Hendrix Experience played Woodstock 's most memorable performance , and one of the greatest of all-time . Featuring the virtuoso guitar talents of Jimi Hendrix , often hailed as the best guitarist ever , amidst bad weather and rowdy crowds the Jimi Hendrix experience played their heart out for nearly 2 and a half hours , and thankfully that concert was taped , and released for Hendrix fan 's enjoyment . Below you will see how The Jimi Hendrix Experience 's legendary performance at Woodstock turned out . . Track Selection-Being new to Hendrix , I was taken on an unexpected but ultimately rewarding ride , as other than Rock N Roll classics ` Foxey Lady ' , ` Purple Haze ' and ` Hey Joe ' , all the rest of these tracks were new to me . Songs such as ` Hear My Train A Comin ' , ` Spanish Castle Magic ' , ` Jam Back At The House ' , and ` Voodoo Child -LRB- Slight Return -RRB- ' are basically examples of Hendrix 's Guitar Mastery , his blistering solos encapsulating the echoes of time and talent to show he was surely a guitar god . ` Izzabella ' , ` Red House ' , ` Lover Man ' , and ` Villanova Junction ' are all bluesy Hard Rockers that showcase magnificent musicianship , and could easily have been hits . ` Foxey Lady ' , ` Purple Haze ' , ` Hey Joe ' , and the minor hit ` Fire ' are all thankfully included here to showcase Hendrix 's biggest hits , but I wish he would have played more . Overall I think the Track Selection is excellent , and could n't have asked for it to be any better ! 5/5Sound Quality-For a bootleg of a concert in 1969 , Jimi Hendrix Experience 's performance sounds outstanding ! The guitar solos and riffs blare out the speakers as if you were right there in the muddy crowd at Woodstock , Hendrix 's vocals are clean , crisp , and easy to hear , and the bass and drums are clearly there and are easily hearable among the more obvious guitar . Surprisingly , some of the best Sound Quality I 've ever heard from a live performance ! 5/5Band Performance-What more can I say ? Jimi Hendrix is in peak form here , his blistering solos and bluesy riffs , unknown at the time still retain their unmistakeable glory over 35 years later , and the backup band , which includes the bass and drums , dishes out a legendary performance alongside Hendrix . Basically , the Band Performance is flawless , perfect , OUTSTANDING ! 5/5Crowd Interaction-The Jimi Hendrix Experience 's concert at Woodstock boasts quite a lot of Crowd Interaction , as Hendrix usually gives a few words after every song , joking and informing throughout , and the crowd shouts often to Hendrix to ` TURN IT UP ! ' , and it all makes for a very interesting experience!Overall , The Jimi Hendrix Experience 's performance at Woodstock is unmistakenly legendary , classic and brilliant in every way , and now stands as one of my favorite Live recordings . Since I was so impressed with this , I expect to pick up many more Hendrix albums in the next few visits to the CD store!HIGHLY RECOMMENED TO FANS OF HENDRIX , ROCK IN GENERAL , BLUES , AND ANYBODY WHO ENJOYS LIVE RECORDINGS ! SIMPLY EPIC , PHENOMENOL , BEAUTIFUL , AND DEFINITELY LOUD!Also Recommended-Jimi Hendrix Experience - Jimi Hendrix ExperienceDisraeli Gears - CreamExperience Hendrix - Jimi HendrixThanks For Reading !
 Most people that know anything about Jimi Hendrix know that he stole the show at Woodstock , and rightfully so . This is his most amazing performance . `` Fire '' is a great , fun song as is `` Izabella . '' `` Red House '' is very heartfelt and is often imitated , never duplicated by many , many bands . A classic ! `` Voodoo Child '' is another great song and just like `` Purple Haze '' is one of his catchiest tunes . `` The Star Spangled Banner '' is Jimi 's heavily-distorted , ultra-cool rendition of the American national anthem . One of the most famous things he ever did . `` Woodstock Improvisation '' can not be fully expressed by words . It is a great instumental track that has to be heard to be appreciated . Everything about this cd is great , but I have to say that the video is better . You get to see the man in action , including the emotion he plays with on `` Red House . '' The reactions from the crowd are nice , too . This is an outstanding album of an outstanding performance and you should definitely buy it now , along with the video . You will not be disappointed .
 Sure , the performance is raw and unrehearsed , and the backing band is not Hendrix 's best , but this is Jimi 's greatest display of pure guitar greatness . The `` Voodoo Child '' medley is absolutely astounding , the guitar anthem to end all guitar anthems . `` The Star Spangled Banner '' is perhaps the greatest guitar solo of all-time . `` Red House '' is excellent , as is `` Hear My Train A-Comin ' . '' The various instrumentals , especially `` Woodstock Improvisitation , '' are all great . If you buy only one Hendrix live album , definitely make it this .
 This quote taken from this performance adequately sums of the gest of this concert segment of the original Woodstock -LRB- filled with sin as it was -RRB- . Some of my favorite guitar music comes from this . The quote above -LRB- You can leave anytime you want , we 're just jamming that 's all -RRB- comes from Voodoo Child , one of the songs found here -LRB- its about 10 minutes 36 seconds into the performance of Voodoo Child -LRB- Slight Return -RRB- / Stepping Stone -RRB- . But before I continue I should tell you my edition is a single disc 12 track version . * If you 're looking for all your favorite songs , do n't bother . But if you 're looking for a phenomenal concert document of one of the greatest guitarists ever -LRB- if not THE -RRB- , then this is the record for you.This record contains a LOT of jamming . This is coming at the end of Woodstock , people are tired , Hendrix 's band is unrehearsed , and he 's nervous . So he just comes out in a blaze of sound and blows everyone out of the water . There are so many guitar riffs and licks just dripping from this its amazing . Since this is Hendrix largely jamming , we get quite a lesson in guitar playing . Because its Hendrix its generally fascinating - had it been anyone else the jams would be overly long and rather boring . But Jimi 's the master of coaxing unbelievable sounds from that electric guitar . From about 2:00 minutes to the finish of Woodstock Improvision ranks one of my favorite of guitar music , and when you here ` Jam Back at the House -LRB- Beginnings -RRB- ' you have to wonder what planet Hendrix CAME FROM . . Villanova Junction will make you stop in your tracks . And we must n't forget one of his most famous tracks of all and the most interesting interpretation of any nation 's anthem , ` The Star Spangled Banner ' . Of course , I have a sympathy for live music . Anything live sounds better than then studio hands down for portraying the sheer power and majesty that music can contain -LRB- for me anyway -RRB- . -LRB- As a rule , I like studio albums better than live ones - but when you actually see the band play the studio ca n't compare -RRB- . But that 's only done in concert , and since Hendrix is dead this is the closest we 'll get to it.Conclusion
 I absolutely believe that this was one of jimi 's best sets ever . I do n't care much for larry lee though . He did n't play a strat but he was ok . The poor guy was gon na get electrocuted . But as far as jimi is concerned this has got to be one of his best live performances ever . My favorite song on this is a scorching version of Voodoo Chid -LRB- Slight Return -RRB- . He just gets so aggressive during the first solo and it shows . His guitar wailing with rage . and of course at the end he picks his guitar with his teeth before going into what is one of the most memorable part of his concert . The Star Spangled Banner . this is just jimi all by himself wailinfg away and using the whammy bar to get some of the most devastatig tones ever . plus there is a great version of Purple Haze too . But I like the version that jimi did at Berkeley better . That one is so agressive . Also the berkeley version contains one of the nastiest teeth solos ever to be put onto film . Overall Woodstock is great .
 Alot of people have noticed that the entire set is not on this album . They complain that it has been tampered with . I think this is the best and most complete disc of his Woodstock performance . Keep in mind , there was never an official Jimi Hendrix Woodstock album . There have been bootlegs over the years , and some odds and ends official releases , but they have not tampered with any past release . This is the most complete version so far . It 's only a compilation . Thats why it is titled `` Live at Woodstock '' , instead of saying `` The complete Woodstock performance '' . This is a great album , and I would buy this until they release the entire performance in its complete form .
 Check out the improvisation after the initial chorus of the Star Spangled banner -LRB- about 2:00 into the song -RRB- . Jimi wails into one of the most chaotic and moving solos bringing out every trick in his book . In the film , there is a scene of the audience at this moment with everyone literally gaping with their mouths open . `` With the rockets red glare ... '' AAAAAAHHHH !!! He KILLED them with his guitar . Very inspired playing.The band of gypsies `` back up band '' certianly was not the best incarnation of the hendrix experience . Its clear he did not need them . His passion and vision , meter , tone , energy had not been untapped . Neil Young once said `` no one was even in the same building as that guy . '' this recording shows that . -LRB- other favorites `` Isle of Wight '' , `` Rainbow Bridge '' , `` Winterland '' , `` Band of gypsies '' , `` Cry of love '' , `` Midnight lightling '' there all good . -RRB-
 Life as a music fan will only be complete after he or she experiences Jimi Hendrix . His magic and depth cab be felt each time his music oozes intensity out of the speakers . It 's important to feel Jimi , to appreciate the immense ability he had not only as a virtuoso guitarist , but as a gifted song craftsman . Simply put , the man was a genius who loved and nurtured the music he wrote . His Woodstock performance , as with his studio albums and other live recordings , possess soul and character rarely found elsewhere , if anywhere at all , and are integral pieces of Rock and Roll history . What a man !
 This is definately the best live recording I have ever heard . Hendrix played a variety of songs , from classics to newer material . The 20 + minute string of improvisation near the end of his performance was very moving .
 jimi talks and plays with the crowd and then explores and unloads then steps back and re-aims . that 's what this disc sounds like to me.he can solo and groove and keep people in the palm of his hands and then stop on a dime.this is a must have for folks who enjoy sheer raw talent and history . jimi was ahead of the curve .
 Just what I like to hear from Jimi -- really , really loud guitar ! NOBODY improvises the way Jimi did , and he did live on stage . I ca n't even air guitar as fast as Jimi played ! Who cares about percussions and bongos ? The Monkeys 's played bongos on their albums . I do n't think anything was edited , Jimi was just too loud for them to hear or too fast for them to keep up ! This is a great CD !
 This could have been excellent but Eddie Kramer edits out the second guitar and the percussion.Also two tunes missing -- tunes that appear nowhere else.In order to further the Hendrix legend -LRB- as if there is a need -RRB- Kramer cheats us.Typical music business B.S. Too bad -- this could have been something awesome.Remember you are NOT hearing the true show -- what a bummer !!!
 I love this CD despite the butcher job Experience Hendrix did of the performance.It really does n't bother me that the Larry Lee songs , Gypsy Woman and Mastermind are omitted from the release ... I found them to be pretty weak.What bothers me is that his solos are totally removed from the mix -LRB- except for a litte bit on Lover Man and a piece on Voodoo Child -RRB- - also not to mention his background vocals from `` Fire '' -LRB- `` Let me stand next to your fire '' -RRB- I kind of dig the dual guitar solos that this show provided - I actually thought Larry Lee 's solos were pretty good too -LRB- albeit slightly out of tune/synch with Jimi 's guitar -RRB- Pieces I 've noticed edited in some form or another are the following
 A good mix , much better than the '94 botch-job . A few criticisms however . Kramer did make tracks like ` Spanish Castle Magic ' & ` Lover Man ' listener-friendly by editing out Lee 's lead guitar , but in doing so he has altered the character of the original performances . They are good examples of Gypsy Sun & Rainbows band workouts . -LSB- Brilliant but flawed . -RSB- Why alter the truth ? ` Jam Back at the House ' could have been left unedited too . Gone are both the percussionists ' solo and Mitch 's drum solo . Why ? The lax percussion break offers the song a little space . Apart from these minor complaints the rest of the tracks are well edited .
 Jimi Hendrix
 As I am listening to Jimi Hendrix from any of his cd 's I am always amazed in some way . His guitar skills are awesome and really nobody will ever be like him again . Over 50 percent of this cd is a guitar solo which really is all chopped up and spread throughout all the songs . `` Star Spangled Banner '' track is a perfect example of his guitar skills . `` Jam Back at the House '' is also very cool because of how he changes every minute and goes into a complete different solo . Also , the songs are much longer . The regular album songs that are only 3-5 minutes on his other cd range from 5-13 minutes on this 2-disc set . `` Voodoo Child '' is over 13 minutes long and its played faster then the album version . Overall all the songs are great and this would be a awesome set to add to your Hendrix collection.I do n't know why the editorial review and also the little booklet say that this is not his best performance , his guitar was n't tuned for this , or they were n't good because none of them knew what they were playing . I thought it was a awesome performance . As Jimi puts it he was just jamming . I thought that was a cool line . It was like he did n't care if the audience left or what they thought , because he was just jamming.TRACK LIST/RATINGDISC 11 . Introduction - -LRB- 2:21 -RRB- -10 / 102 .

 Jimi Hendrix is the greatest guitar player of all time . On this cd you get to her him play at probally his best !!! It is breath - taking . I am in love with Jimi Hendrix . He is the best song writer/guitar player . This cd has some of the best songs . Woodstock improv . is amazing and its hard to believe its made up on the spot . Villanova Junction , Message to love , spanish castle magic , and jam back at the house are my favorites . People dont even no that there is so much more wonderful music than jus purple haze . . you just have to search around and find other songs that are in better than purple haze . JIMI RULES !!!!!
 This performance captures something of what happens to a romantic genius at his peak . His skills are at their highest level as far as I can see and he presents new material that clearly discloses his genius . Just get the DVD of his entire performance and -LRB- Try to -RRB- follow his right hand fingers on the improvisation following Purple Haze . Incredibly fast , accurate and complicated . Really unbelievable.A very angry , enlightened , loud-spoken introvert , Hendrix is somewhat of a walking contradiction . But who cares ? And also very funny . At Woodstock , he says at one point , `` waiting all these three years -LSB- sic -RSB- -LRB- try days -RRB- , with a little bit of rain ... '' Coming from Seattle , maybe it appeared to him like just a little bit of rain , but the guy just cracks me up.He is criticized in the liner notes for ending with `` Hey Joe , '' but I disagree as it was the first song I believe that got him noticed and I believe he was too tired to play the long version of Voodoo Chile , which , by the way , is a great version that for some reason gets grossly overshadowed by the Slight Return version . Too long and hard to do live I guess .
 WHEN I LISTENED TO THE CD I FEEL THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING MISSING IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE CHEESY POP BANDS TODAY . HENDRIX AS USUAL PLAYS A GREAT SET OF SONGS AND IMPROVISATION MIXED TOGETHER.I WOULD RECOMMENDTHIS CD TO A HARD CORE HENDRIX AFFICIONADO
 I have just about every Hendrix recording that I could get my hands on for the last 29 years . This album is just about the best . There is uncut previously unreleased material that the Hendrix family was kind enough to provide us , his long time fans who crave the sound of his music even to this day . The cuts Jam back at the House , Woodstock Improv , and Villanova Junction are like nothing anyone has ever heard from any other artist . This is an absolute must for anyone who loves the sound of the electric guitar in all its glory .
 ANOTHER EXCELLENT LIVE RECODING IN THE BAG . IT FEATURES UNRELEASED LIVE WOODSTOCK MATERIAL LIKE HEY JOE AND MESSAGE TO LOVE . THIS IS A MUST FOR ANY JIMI HENDRIX COLLECTION .
 This CD box set got lost in the mail . . but was replaced immediately.The selections of Roger Williams are beautifully played.Henry Mancini and the Romantic Strings truly provides us with super romantic full instrumental music.You wo n't regret this CD collection to be played over and over again .
 Ayers ' first album , `` Joy of a Toy , '' was more or less a solo effort , but `` Shooting '' was recorded with his band of the time , The Whole World , and the input of the other members of the band diversifies but does n't dilute the Kevin Ayers sound . It would be tempting to say that this is what Soft Machine might have sounded like if Ayers had n't left the group . Ayers ' songs are given subtle and tricky arrangements , and alternate with almost Sun Ra-like instrumental freakouts -LRB- notably `` P * sser Dans Un Violon , '' which goes on too long , and `` Underwater , '' which does n't -RRB- . A very young Mike Oldfield adds guitar and bass playing here , notably the fabulously freaked-out guitar solo in `` Lunatics Lament . '' Lol Coxhill adds suitably demented and interesting -LRB- but never overbearing -RRB- electric sax and woodwind work.Ayers ' songs , as usual , seem almost casual on the surface but on closer inspection reveal an intelligence and direction that bring him fairly close to his contemporary and friend , Syd Barrett . Ayers ' dark , luminous baritone voice is his own , however , and his worldview , although sometimes a bit demented , is not burdened with the overtones of paranoia and fear that edge Barrett 's work . Ayers ' pastoral and carefree view of life informs everything he writes , but do n't be decieved by the surface . There 's a lot going on underneath , and repeated listenings will reveal more.The extra tracks are terrific . One could argue that `` Hat '' might go on too long but it gets irrevocably stuck in your head , as do many of the songs here . The remastering is quite good.Kevin Ayers is something of a forgotten jewel in the British crown of eccentric rock , but he has been a hidden influence on many , including Robyn Hitchcock and Julian Cope . The reissues of Ayers ' first four albums -LRB- arguably his best -RRB- are more than welcome , and anyone interested in a very different yet accessible musical view of the world will want this CD .
 There 's more going on in a typical Ayers song than in most music of the time - or of today . Very `` progressive '' in the best and worst sense of the term , but with moments of brilliance . Several tracks give Oldfield room to show what he would accomplish in his later solo work . Try Joy of a Toy first , but this is fun too .
 Circa 1970-71 . So he handed me this vinyl as if it was something precious . Have a listen to this Belgo Geordie man . Time you got rid of that Ringo Starr solo album . Well , I let him have it ! This Kevin Ayers was never in the Beatles . The Whole World , scoff , scoff , theyd never amount to much . More chance of them joining Grand Funk Railroad than getting to no 1 or being on Top of the Pops etc. . Certain amount of sock in the mouth I fear . because bless his pointy little Head -LRB- Adam Dale -RRB- we were soon singing the `` Oyster and the Flying Fish '' - `` no Adam you be Bridget this time '' . Anyway , mosey on down the old time warp to 2012 and reflect on `` Shooting At The Moon '' . Firsts off , it was experimental . Pop , meets in the blender and goes six rounds with Lol Coxhill and is smothered in Ayers pre-glam treacle . Tubular Bells it is not-and I for one am grateful . I liked the vinyl and on the bonus CD only `` Puis Je '' does it for me-the Belgo part you understand . How many of you know Bradley Wiggins is Belgian ? Born in Ghent . But the experimentation is superb because it challenges you to listen to what the musicians are creating . It has more than survived time . I still like it and yes Adam , I no longer have any solo Ringo Star in my collection and I am better for it . See the drugs do work . And for that matter , this is the only Kevin Ayers -LRB- if you do n't count Soft Machine -RRB- in me possession . Lol Coxhill ? Never heard of him guv , shifty sort of a bloke with a saxophone -LRB- invented by a Belgian -RRB- welded to his lower lip . I think he plays with Bruce Springsteen these days . Toys with him .
 Kevin Ayers distinct voice and musical arrangements set him apart from his contemporaries . In this album the talents of his session musicians Mike Oldfield and David Bedford et al have been fully harnessed and exhibited . This is a sophisticated pop album with strong progressive elements a successful attempt and assertion that he can do one too to be at par in that period of progressive pompousness . A four track album with two epic suites . You can hear instrumental noodling reminiscent of the first two King Crimson albums . KA was able to coherently fuse his lyrical expertise and the experimentation with the avant garde . It requires a lot of active listening to fully appreciate this album . Though only at 40 minutes this is a concise recording with standout and playful songs like Clarence in wonder land and the oyster fish , very whimsical , very English and very Kevin Ayers .
 How one band , let alone one English town , could 've produced both a Robert Wyatt and a Kevin Ayers is beyond my imagination . I 'm not familiar with Kevin 's later works , but of his early post Soft Machine work , i find this to be the most challenging and rewarding . The album is four tracks long , though all are the containers for several lovely songs that are pieced together through sound collages and disjointed jams . Fans of Gorkys Zygotic Mynchi , Super Furrys , and OTC should definitly give this a try . I would suggest also ordering it directly from the label 's -LRB- BGO Records -RRB- website where it can be purchased for 10 pounds .
 Listen to it more than once ... and then it consumes you . This is not for fans of mindless pop - this is for those who like to disappear inside of/get lost in music .
 Cry me a regret that no one has yet stepped up to fill the sultry vocal gap left when Julie London passed on . Her unique style was a mix of languid phrasing and a smoky alto voice unfortunately fueled by cigarettes . Laura Taylor , a Vegas-based performer , comes close to London 's sound . With tasteful accompaniment by guitarist Joe Lano and bassist Tom Warrington , London 's takes on the title track and on `` Blue Moon '' are nearly as evocative as those of her model . A little more rasp in her whisper would have left London 's bridges falling down and Taylor as the new fair lady .
 This CD by TKO Magnum clearly leads one to the assumption that it contains tracks in which Bessie Smith and Louis Armstrong performed `` Together '' , hence its title . Tracks 1 - 6 are subtitled Armstrong/Smith and are very good of Armstrong instrumentally and vocally . The problem lies in that Bessie Smith is not included . Tracks 9-16 are Bessie Smith favorites and good recordings . They do not include Armstrong and are not purported to do so . The short review by Greg Cormick mentions the `` Smith-Armstrong sides '' , tracks , as interesting , restrained and `` more controlled than the usual Smith recordings '' . Is there a collaboration CD of Bessie Smith performing with Louis Armstrong ? If there is , this is not it but if it was it would be great !
 One great cd of a great band . buy it .
 Recorded at Studio Fredman - hence production is excellent . Reminds strongly of early Dark Tranquility , but with more often tempo changes , which I personally find slightly annoying . But definitely there are listeners who would consider it a plus . Good buy for every Melodic Death fan .
 J. D. Sumner has a deep bass voice which is used both as an excellent musical voice and as an audience hook - playing with his low end range . Stamps is a major name in training Southern Gospel Male Quartets and printing music for them . This collection includes the full range from memorable performances to merely competent i.e. other quartets have recorded more memorable versions . However , the collection is a very important addition to the available recordings illustrating the development of the Southern White Gospel style.Vol 1 . contains I 've got to walk that lonesome road ; Roll on Jordan ; Smooth sailing ; I just steal away and pray ; What kind of a church ; The farmer and the Lord ; The rainbow of love ; At Calvary ; The Sweetest words He ever said ; I 'm gon na serve the Lord today ; You got ta pay as you can ; If you know the Lord ; How great Thou are . The Farmer and the Lord , I Just Steal Away and Pray and The Sweetest Words He Ever Said are the most memorable.Vol 2 . contains Give the world a smil ; I 'll have a new song ; My dearest friend ; Victory Road ; I believe ; His love ; The walls of Jericho ; Lord give us vitory ; The old country church ; The shadow of His love ; Swing low , sweet chariot ; Peace in the Valley . Victory Road and The Walls of Jericho are the most memorable . If you are n't familiar with the Blackwood Brothers ' version of The Old Country Church beside which this rendition pales , you will find this an excellent cut .
 If you love J.D. like I do you must have this one . I really enjoy listening to J.D. 's deep voice . There is no way I could choose my favorite song , there are just too many and I loved them all .
 Best record these guys ever put out ... and I should know because I paid for it and released it ! Conrad Uno should get alot of credit for capturing their primal sound . But I guess 3 days of 10hr Lock-out in the studio would bring out the best , or worst , of any band . Luckily , it was the former instead of the latter.Original cover art turned out way too sepia-toned , even with test presses . Last time I ever used an East Coast film house -LRB- not gon na mention any names cause they 'd probably blame us anyway -RRB- . Vinyl could n't be fixed but we made stickers of the new , more orange artwork , for the CD 's and sadly , someone got stuck stickering them on a few thousand CD 's . But if ya rip the cellophane off the thing , it 's hard to peel the sticker off . So , if ya bought the thing and ya do n't like the dark brown cover , contact me and I 'll send ya the `` fix-it '' sticker .
 As mentioned by the other reviewer ; thank goodness he paid for it ! This slab of Stooges based punk mayhem is absolutely the bees knees ; or at least the roaches britches . Raw , loose , and sweaty just like she likes it . Production is kept to a bare minimum and hooray for that . I am on my second copy of this disc and I can say this is a Desert Island top 10 . Bitchin , very bitchin ...
 Magnitude 9 are a truly great prog metal band . The songs are very well written and produced . The obvious strength of the band is guitarist Rob Johnson . Rob has impressive technique . However , he does shred a little too much at times . His melodic playing needs some work . The keyboards are very strong . Corey Brown is one of the best singers I have heard . He has a very unique sound and he sings with passion and feeling . This band should be placed up there with Dream Theater , Symphony X , Shadow Gallery , and Ice Age . My favorite tunes are `` Afterlife '' and `` What My Eyes Have Seen '' . This album is worth every penny and will never get old . You owe it to yourself to buy this disc .
 I bought this after reading some reviews . Now that I own it - I went back to the reviews ... they are right on - this is GREAT PROGRESSIVE METAL ... some of the best I have ever heard . I do n't think the guitarist chops too much - its metal after all ... I do think though if these guys had a better producer and recording process - they would be one of the best progressive metal bands . Play this CD after listening to Evergrey or SymphonyX and you can tell the production is weak . They try - oh do they try.The good news - the music is to darn good . Once listening to the CD after about the 3 songs the production wo n't kill you as much . The Lyrics are great , the guitars , drums , keyboards , base , and arrangements all TOP NOTCH . I would love to see these guys in a different studio or have someone else produce it.This well worth a buy and continuous listening .
 Magnitude 9 's latest offering , Reality in Focus , is a definite `` must buy '' . Everything about this disc , and this band , is a breath of fresh air . While it seems that so many other progressive metal bands , are embroiled in a holy war over who can write the longest , most complex song , Magnitude 9 never loses sight of the obvious ; music is about writing good songs.For those of you who have never heard Magnitude 9 , I feel that their sound can best be described as a combination of Fates Warning , Dokken and Yngwie J. Malmsteen . They arrive at this sound through the incredible vocal talents of Corey Brown and the guitar wizardry of Rob Johnson . However , the band 's talents run much deeper than just Corey and Rob . Keyboard player Joseph Anastacio Glean is excellent , and the drummer , whose name escapes me , is absolutely superb.Reality in Focus starts off with the aptly titled `` No Turning Back '' . This track kicks off what is nearly an hour of audio bliss . All of the songs on this disc are melodic enough to enjoy on the first listen , but complex enough to enjoy at infinitum . And while the boys in M9 are n't shy about showcasing their respective talents , their displays of virtuosity never come at the price of compromising the integrity of a song.I wo n't bore you with highlights , as I truly love every song on this disc . Truth be told , I have n't listened to anything else since purchasing this opus . If you are a fan of progressive metal , or just a fan of good music in general , I highly recommend Reality in Focus .
 After buying the new Magnitude 9 cd `` Decoding The Soul '' I wanted to hear more from this band that I just recently stumbled upon . So I bought the bands 2nd release `` Reality in Focus '' . Boy , am I glad I did !!!! This CD is another pleaser . My take on this cd : The songs are a bit more complex and a bit more prog metal I guess . Still they are lined with the qualities I listen for.MELODY , HOOKS and TALENT.The best being : Far Beyond IllusionWhat My Eyes Have SeenEnd of DaysAfterlifeThis CD is a good combination of prog metal , neoclassical and power metal . More along the lines of Symphony X , Artension and Dream Theater.Another must buy !!
 WOW how good are these guys i mean i have listened to so much prog metal form Black jester to Dreamtheater and these guys are up there with the best of them . I personly think this CD is most compatible to -LRB- perfect symmetry -RRB- Fates warning but it has a bit more emotion . This CD has so much going for it , the songs are very well writen , the music has power , with a great sense of melody , the lyrics are good , the vocals are similar to Ray Alder and it is so consistant that it is a should own for any good prog metal CD collection . I ADVISE TO BUY THIS CDand give it three plays to get into it .
 I first heard Magnitude 9 `` Chaos to Control '' and was blown away by Corey Brown 's incredible vocals and Rob Johnson heavy yet very progressive style of guitar playing . On `` Reality in Focus '' the band adds new dimension , plus keeps it 's heavy prog influences . If you like Dream Theater or Enchant this is a must have ! I also recommend Chaos to Control and the band Psycho Drama -LRB- Corey Brown on vocals -RRB- . Any serious prog/metal fan should add Magnitude 9 to their collection .
 At first I thought this was just an average disc , but like most reviewers , after several repeated listens I began to realize the inspiration behind the melodies and vocals . The guitaring is excellent and the choruses are very melodic , if not catchy . I find myself enjoying this CD longer than most because it challenges the listener to soak in melodies that do n't sound recycled . Every song has an excellent , intense rhythm that 's a shot of nitroglycerin . My only complaint is that maybe the band should have put in a couple of cool ballads to balance out the song variety -- this way it does n't sound as if every song is similar in tempo -- otherwise , excellent effort !
 It 's getting harder to find good music every year . I rely on these reviews , and the recommendations of a few distant friends , to introduce me to new artists . But the risk of buying a lousy CD is pretty high , especially after 10 years of grunge and `` alternative '' garbage.Then I found this recording . All previous regrets were erased . `` Reality in Focus '' makes up for all of them.First of all , they do a raging cover of `` Flight of Icarus '' , and to do Iron Maiden at all , let alone on a level equal to Bruce and The Boys , takes guts and talent . But as good as this track is , it 's only a cover . Their original material is even better . Like other reviewers , my hopes were raised with the blistering opening track `` No Turning Back '' ; still , I ended each track worried the rest of the album could n't possibly maintain the pacing and writing . There was no need to worry ; Magnitude 9 crafted each song like a master work . From start to finish , this CD rocked so hard , so tastily , and so intelligently , I came right back to Amazon.com looking for their previous releases.Oh no ! They only have one , and it 's nearly impossible to get here ! Quick , lock these guys in a studio until they put out another 10 albums like this ! We need to balance the junk that the music industry keeps releasing by supporting artists like these guys . We want more like this , do n't we?I know I do . I spin this disc several times a week , usually repeating `` Afterlife '' and `` Quiet Desperation '' long after the disc stops . Drives my wife crazy . But the musicianship , the writing , the heart and majesty in this recording -- wow wow wow.I took a chance in buying this , unheard . It was absolutely worth it . You will agree . This is great , great metal by any standard , easily on a level with the best work by Dream Theater , Fates Warning , or Queensryche , but without the bombast that seems to come with those groups . I am very much looking forward to the next release from Magnitude 9 ; until then , this CD will continue getting lots and lots of play time in my house and car .
 What an amazing second album from Magnitude 9 ! This album is a great follow up to the first . Once again , Rob Johnson proves that he is one of the best guitarists around . Vocalist Corey Brown shines through the whole album . I have been a fan of Corey Brown since his days with Psyco Drama and still with his up and coming project Section 16 . Corey seems to just get better and better with every project that he does . The proof is on this album . I do n't want to forget the rest of the band either . Awesome keys , bass , and drums . What a band to back up this incredible duo !!! Great job guys !!!
 Hello , We hope you enjoy our latest release
 The best progressive metal band out there PERIOD . Every member of this group is extremely talented . Corey Brown -LRB- Vocalist -RRB- sounds like Tony Harnell -LRB- TNT -RRB- , Ray Alder -LRB- Fates Warning -RRB- , and Bruce Dickinson -LRB- Maiden -RRB- all in one . Rob Johnson -LRB- Guitar -RRB- can shred with the best of them . Fans of Dream Theater 's `` Images & Words '' must own this album . If you have n't already , do yourself a favor and buy their debut album as well `` Chaos to Control '' you 'll be glad you did .
 Heard the first one , and own the latest . These guys have great music . The vox are very good mix of G. Tates and B. Dickinson voice , the guitarist sounds alot like Malmsteen with the only difference that Malmsteen does not know how to compose , and the rest of the band fill in the sound just right . If you like Dream Theater , Malmsteen , Rainbow , . . and other Prog Groups like Symphony X -LRB- BEST PROG METAL BAND -RRB- , Conception , e.tc . you will definetley love this guys ... . The singer 's previous band PSYCHO DRAMA was excellent !!!!!!!!!!
 The diversity of the songs on this album is truly incredible . Each one stands out from the others with its own unique sound , evoking a myriad of emotions ranging from joy to melancholy . `` Tonight , '' an intense yet simple love song , is rife with a dark , heady euphoria , expressed in such lyrics as `` no regrets , no turing back , oh throw all caution to the wind '' . The same intensity is transformed into disappointment in the sorrowful `` Shadow , '' a portrait of unrequited love . `` And the rain beats on the window pane , counting the years passing . You never came . '' The collection has its share of quiet , introspective songs , including a haunting cover of `` Alice '' and the deliciously morbid `` Ashes in the Wind . '' -LRB- I ca n't begin to describe how much I love this song , with its eerie vocals and surreal imagery . `` Gathered on stony steps , we breathe our last whispers of the end . '' It 's one of the Shroud 's most melodic songs , and perhaps also the `` gothiest '' . -RRB- But there are also more energetic pieces , such as `` Caged Bird '' and `` Sulfur , Salt and Mercury , '' which seem almost to scintillate with a dark energy . The different styles are well balanced , though . There 's a whimsical , almost ethereal quality to all the songs , and the entire album has a vaguely pagan overtone . One can hear many elements of the style later developed in A Dark Moon Night , though there 's also a raw quality here which reminds me a little of Switchblade Symphony 's Serpentine Gallery.This album continues to hold my interest although I 've played it countless times . The melodies are beautiful , the lyrics at times inspirational . This is a band which deserves a lot more attention , and an album that I highly recommend .
 This is a beautiful album , melodic but fresh . Too many goth bands either go for a pounding , dark rock sound , or go totally ethereal . Either extreme gets boring after a while . This band does a little of both , throws in a female lead who sounds properly goth without pretending to be a fallen angel or a vampire queen , and makes the whole thing sound great . ` Falling Dream ' is a spacy kind of fantasy in a fairy tale style . ` Alice ' is a brilliant rocker with a fresh delivery - sometimes I actually prefer it to the original -LRB- if you did n't know , it 's an ancient Sisters of Mercy song -RRB- . A great bunch of songs for those who wish goth music had n't gotten so vapidly pretentious in the Nineties .
 Amongst the thousands of Pearl Jam imitators , wanna-be rap stars , typical ` watered-down ' sound of top 40 , and adult contemporary , is a underground scene , which is unknown to the majority of the masses . within this underground scene there are many scenes , and in the darkest Shadows of the underground sits a `` Gothic '' scene . Hidden in the Esoteric underground is a band comprised of five very talented people , and those people are in a band , and that band is called THE SHROUD . Led by the beautiful Lydia Fortner , who writes all the lyrics and sings them with a passion that has been missing in rock music for many years , The Shroud , who hail from Fresno , Cal . are the first band in the Gothic community who have managed to meld classic rock instrumentation , classical music , Dream Pop , and Gothic Rock into a sound that is very unique . Upon listening to this Cd the very first time it was like undergoing some sort of spiritual awakening . One feels like they are entering a trance for the first time , and thrown into a mystical world that falls somewhere between `` Alice in Wonderland and Braum Stokers Dracula '' . For example Lydia manages to weave a spell over the listener with her beautiful voice in the song `` CAGED BIRD '' , where she sings `` Jade and Silver overhead Orchids crushed upon your bed Your thoughts may wander freely And the caged bird sings so sweetly . . '' , which intices the listener to listen more and more and even more . In the song `` Sulphur , Salt , and Mercury '' , which is an Alchemical formula , but utilized as a message from Lydia , that people should open themselves to the world of the dark as evident when she sings `` Open your heart and see the night and you 'll be blinded by your newfound sight . '' followed by a fact known to all practitioners of the Occult `` Without the sun shining deadly bright all things take on their own true light . '' In the Waltz `` She '' , a song about childhood memories , Lydia sings

 I 'll be frank with everybody here . I 've owned this album forwhat seems like forever and I still enjoy it immensely ! I would haveto say that this is a very experimental album for them because it is rather raw . A listener can hear a multitude of band dynamics along with musical dynamics going on . Each song takes a different direction . I can see where the seeds were sown for `` A Dark Moon Night '' when I listen to this record . I simply adore Lydia Fortner 's vocals and words . The music is good too . :-RRB- This band continually surprises me with the diversity and depth of their material . One might think this album has multiple personalities and that is because it does . This band is one that is filled with dynamic , creative , and assertive individuals who seem to just push and pull themselves to stellar , creative heights ! Listen for yourself ! `` Drowning Dream '' -LRB- their first EP -RRB- is really cool . `` Death 's too Late '' alone makes this EP worth it . I 've become a pretty big fan of theirs and I started with this album . So , I definitely believe it 's worth your while . I hope this was helpful . Happy listening ! END

 With the internet becoming more accessible for more and more bands every day , there is no doubt that some kind of new music explosion is highly probable . Many independent bands no longer have to rely on big major label support , and mass media acceptance . Many bands are claiming thousands of new fans in droves every day , due to cheap access and affordable marketing by way of the internet . The Shroud are a band who have been aware of the importance of the internet for self marketing for some time now . People from all over the world now have the chance to find out about unique bands such as the Shroud once they log on . The Shroud , a Fresno quintet are part of the `` Gothic '' subculture in California led by the beautiful Lydia Fortner , who writes and sings for the Shroud . When I first bought this cd I was filled with such joy that I had to tell everyone I talked to about this band . The bands arrangements are well constructed and professional . Lydia has the most beautiful voice i 've ever heard . The guitarist , Rodney Walker knows how to weave guitar lines , and arpeggios around Lydias voice , and knows to pick the appropriate time to `` Rock '' out , rather than playing dissonance like many bands do today . the band 's compositions range from Waltzes to ethereal to uptempo Rockers . I just wish the music industry would wake up and give a band like The Shroud a listen , for they are one of the best bands i 've heard in over a decade . With `` Gothic '' oriented films and tv shows , you 'd think they would jump at the chance to sign every Gothic band in site . When the day comes -LRB- which is inevitable -RRB- when bands like The Shroud finally gain mass recognition , I 'll be telling everyone `` I told you they would make the big time '' .
 For any of you who enjoy Fading Colors , Switchblade Symphony , Black Tape for a Blue Girl , or any other `` goff '' / experimetal bands '' this cd is a must have . If you have the Black Bible and or want it ... The Shroud is the next best thing .
 I ca n't fault the music on this compilation . Everything the Jam recorded was brilliant , and this double-disc set accurately conveys this with 49 amazing guitar-pop gems.My only problem with this set is with its focus . It seems to be a random collection of singles , album tracks , b-sides and rarities without clear narrative . It 's hard to imagine what the compilers were thinking.This compilation contains nearly all of the bands A-sides -LRB- it 's missing All Around the World , A Bomb in Wardour Street , Precious , Just Who is the Five O'Clock Hero , and The Bitterest Pill -LRB- I 've Ever Had to Swallow -RRB- , many songs from their albums -LRB- two from In the City , one from The Modern World , five from All Mod Cons , five from Setting Sons , four from Sound Affects , and three from The Gift -RRB- and nearly all of Extras , the band 's B-sides and rarities collection . It 's also worth mentioning that among these tracks are covers of songs by the Kinks , James Brown , Curtis Mayfield , the Beatles , the Who , the Small Faces , and the Chi-Lites that are well worth checking out.Disc one runs in roughly chronological order -LRB- disc two is aimless -RRB- , but A-sides and B-sides can be found on both discs . And although the band 's B-sides often contained their best work , it is strange that the album includes more non-album tracks than album tracks . It might have made more sense to sacrifice a rarity or two in favor of the rest of the A-sides and a few more album tracks from the first two albums.Despite all of this , the music is great , and I highly recommend it for anyone intersested in British indie , new wave , and vintage punk .
 These cds sound great . Unfortunately , the version of Smithers-Jones found here is the one with orchestral accompaniment from Setting Sons . If you prefer the single ; the hard-driving electric version of the song , as I do , you will have to buy Snap ! or Extras . If you liked ` The Bitterest Pill -LRB- I Ever Had To Swallow -RRB- ' , you will not find that in this collection either . Because it was released as a single , you must look for it on another compilation like ` The Jam - Greatest Hits ' , or ` The Very Best of the Jam ' .
 This 2-disc set encapsulates everything that was great and glorious about Paul `` the Modfather '' Weller and the Jam . From the opening notes on Disc 1 to the closing tunes on Disc 2 , the whole sonic history of the best band that Britain produced in the late 1970 's is revealed .
 Disc one is the entire `` The Sound of The Jam '' compilation . Disc two is `` Extras '' without three titles which would have duplicated in name tracks on disc one but has five tracks added . In effect , two essential albums in one case .
 If you like the Jam then , you got ta get this disc ! Has older songs that are hard to find anywhere else . Get it TODAY !!!!
 Whether you 're a seasoned Jam fan or just discovering them , this CD contains most of their well-known songs . Having been a fan since the early 80 's -LRB- gulp ! -RRB- , I 've enjoyed listening to these tracks over the years . And yes , Weller really is my last name .

 This most recent collection reminds me of another one they put out . Maybe because this one is exactly the same , track for track , as the limited edition `` Best Of '' from 2002 . I do n't know what the point is , they 're both imports and expensive . However , based on what 's included it 's a decent package . Disc one is simply 15 of their most popular songs , while disc two is 9 remixes . I would prefer a 30 track 2-disc collection myself , but they did n't ask me . That one is probably still a few years off . Overall I 'd say casual fans could just get the single disc `` Best Of '' . Though the mixes are done well , this is more for fanatics . Or the `` Once ... '' and `` Twice Upon A Time '' collections are a good choice too .
 Never been all THAT thrilled about remixes , but this compilation is well assembled , I thought . On disc one , you get basically a fifteen track anthology of tunes like `` Dear Prudence '' , `` Cities In Dust '' , the inspiring `` Happy House '' , `` Christine '' , my all time Siousxie & The Banshees favorite `` Spellbound '' , `` Killing Jar '' and the rather dark `` Arabian Knights '' . Disc two provides nine -LRB- 9 -RRB- remixes , some are of cuts that I 've already listed . Pretty much aimed at long time Siousxie fans . Well worth checking out .
 Having heard that Siouxsie and the Banshees grew out of the punk movement -LRB- their lead singer was at the Sex Pistol 's debut performance , I think ... a concert which which gave birth to lots of musical careers to the small number of people who went to watch that -RRB- , I was expecting something a lot rawer in sound than what I found here . Years ago I remember having heard `` Cities in dust '' on alternative radio and liking it , and more recently I 've seen `` Hong Kong garden '' on a music video show like `` Rage '' . These are their best songs and pretty indicative of what they sound like ... very polished and accomplished musically.Can ' t really say that this compilation has any bad songs as such ... they all pretty much listenable , which is a definite plus to me.My picks as the best or more interesting tracks on this two cd compilation/remix collection are : Dear Prudence-a cover of The Beatles ' song . The guitar reminded of a later song ... `` Handle with care '' by The Travelling Wilburys , which also feature ex Beatle George Harrison . It 's a polished and poppy cover of the original but does sound a little ` trippy ' at times.Hong Kong garden-has a simple melody but is catchy nonetheless . Lead guitar sounds nice and a xylophone type instrument is featured.Cities in dust-nice , trippy/new agey intro -LRB- has running water sounds -RRB- ; features bells , a catchy , sing-a-long kind of chorus , and looooooong notes by Siouxsie.Kiss them for me-I like Siouxsie 's cute , child-like vocals here . Has a hip-hop type scratchy element to the song , an Indian sounding intro which continues in one form or another throughout the song . Nice melody and chorus . Has a cello in the arrangement too , I think.Stargazer-has a catchy chorus and the guitar sounds a little Indian.Peek-a-boo
 I purchased this CD for a presentation I was giving to nursing home residents about the life and music of Gene Autry . This album is of high quality and contained all of the songs I was seeking to use during my presentation .
 Always loved the story about Will Rogers hearing Gene singing in the train depot in Chelsea where he worked as a telegrapher . Will told Gene he would go far with his talent .
 we 've all been younger , better looking , had nicer voices , slimmer bodies and cuter hats.so i found a wonderful , handsome singer with a strong young voice singing beautiful songs no one hears anymore . an unexpected super-treat for me . i am enjoying this cd much more than i expected to . i was only searching for words from one of the songs , but gene autry has left his magic for me . thank you , amazon.sharon owens .
 This CD is great . I play it all day . I put this CD on my Computer and dropped a tune or two from play list that were not my Fav . like ` Good Night Irene ' and now I play it a lot . Great Sound , Great Tunes . Gene Was Tops and deserves all 5 Stars on The Walk of Fame .
 The Gene Autry recordings keep surfacing and gathering plenty of steam with this latest release `` THE ESSENTIAL GENE AUTRY '' ... the sound quality is excellent and nostalgic for the wranglers who grew up listening to `` America 's Favorite Singing Cowboy '' ... for the first time ever a 2-CD-Set covering his entire Columbia Records career , absolutely essential for all cowboys and gals ... Gene 's good guy image with catchy lyrics and beautiful melodies are pleasant and extremely calming ... after listening these songs over and over , you are transported back in time when life was simpler and the good guys always won . Gene was the screen 's first `` Singing Cowboy '' , already well known in the late '20s as a radio and recording star . Autry began making films in 1934 and kept cranking them out except for a short visit with Uncle Sam in the United States Army Air during World War 2 . Ride down the trail to Melody Ranch and meet the only entertainer with five stars on the `` Hollywood Walk of Fame '' . One each for radio , recordings , films , television and live appearances . The Autry Museum of Western Heritage is a world-class center devoted to preserving and interpreting the rich history and traditions of the American West ... Gene maintained his own coterie of fine songwriters to keep him supplied with original tunes ... his wondrously effective singing voice was warm , reassuring and nostalgic ... somes marvelous recordings from Gene 's early days in films ... 40 historic songs from his rise to superstardom in `` horse-operas '' . `` TUMBLING TUMBLEWEEDS '' and `` BACK IN THE SADDLE AGAIN '' were big Autry recordings and became movie titles ... and `` GHOST RIDERS IN THE SKY '' became a classic for him and other recording artists ... other highlights ~ SOUTH OF THE BORDER -LRB- DOWN MEXICO WAY -RRB- , MEXICALI ROSE , THAT SILVER-HAIRED DADDY OF MINE , WHEN IT 'S SPRINGTIME IN THE ROCKIES , BE HONEST WITH ME , DEEP IN THE HEART OF TEXAS , TAKE ME BACK TO MY BOOTS AND SADDLE , YOU ARE MY SUNSHINE , JINGLE JANGLE JINGLE , DO N'T FENCE ME IN , HAVE I TOLD YOU LATELY THAT I LOVE YOU , GOODNIGHT IRENE , SIOUX CITY SUE , HOME ON THE RANGE , ON TOP OF OLD SMOKEY , BUTTONS AND BOWS , OLD CHISHOLM TRAIL , PETER COTTON TAIL . . plus many , many more gave us such pleasure when we saw Gene on that big screen.During my childhood I grew up listening to Gene Autry 's Christmas music ... there is n't a more special way to celebrate Christmas than hearing `` Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer '' performed by Gene ... now that I have my grandchildren , I want them to have the same wonderful memories that I experienced ... this was good old fashioned Christmas spirit that the entire family loved and enjoyed ... Gene Autry who was responsible for keeping one of the world 's greatest Christmas traditions alive the `` Hollywood Christmas Parade '' , when bad times surfaced and needed some assistance financially ... it was Gene who came to the rescue as Johnny Grant -LRB- Honary Mayor of Hollywood -RRB- did whatever it took to keep the parade the class-A Holiday event from going under ... drawing approximatley one million spectators along the parade route each year , Hollywood 's biggest single-day event and the kick off for the Holiday Season ... this was all from Gene 's generous support and giving spirit.By 1969 Gene 's version of `` RUDOLPH '' had sold 6,500,000 copies and was the all-time top selling single for Columbia Records -LRB- the 1957 version , recorded for Gene 's Challenge label , is included here -RRB- ... `` RUDOLPH '' ranks as the second favorite Christmas song right behind Irving Berlin 's `` White Christmas '' . But let 's go back to the 1946 , on a Thanksgiving weekend and a Gene rode tall in the saddle , and Santa Claus was right around the bend , heard the children excited chants of `` HERE COMES SANTA CLAUS '' ... and a song was born from Gene and co-written by Oakley Haldeman ... recorded on August 28th , 1947 and became an instant hit . Then in 1949 songwriter Johnny Marks composed a tune from a poem - `` RUDOLPH , THE RED-NOSED REINDEER '' many artist turned down the chance to record this classic , but Ina Autry , Gene 's first wife loved the song and felt the children would love it too ... she was right ... and the rest my friends , is history ... this Autry Collection is Essential for all fans of Country Music and Western Films ... do n't miss this one , you 'll never regret it!Total Time
 Like many of the old-time singing cowboys , screen star Gene Autry has long been discounted by some country snobs , who see him as too hokey to be part of the classic country canon . Too bad for those folks , though , because Autry 's music is both rich in country tradition and musical show-biz savvy . Like Roy Rogers and other hayseed Hollywood harmonizers , Autry dipped liberally into jazz and swing , giving his music a nice little bounce . The songs are delightfully corny and often well-crafted , drawing on the traditions of the Tin Pan Alley composers -- this is music that was made to entertain , and it still works its magic , all these decades later . This is a nice 2-CD set that gathers material from many of the labels Autry recorded for , including Columbia , Okeh , Vocalion and a slew of smaller outfits , and spans his career from 1931 , when he was still singing roughneck blues -LRB- ala Jimmie Rodgers -RRB- up through the early 1950s , when his success with `` Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer '' had led him to a profitable sideline singing songs for kiddies . This is an excellent collection which really does justice to the wide range of material Autry covered ... Highly recommended !
 If you 're only going to buy one Gene CD , it should be this , especially now that the compilation that pulls songs right off of his film soundtracks is no longer in print . My only reservation is that this collection does n't include `` The Last Round-Up '' or `` Bury Me on the Lone Prairie '' -- also I would have replaced this original `` Silver-Haired Daddy '' with a more soulful one , but then again the one here was the one that won Gene the first Gold Record ever -LRB- not HIS first , but THE first -RRB- , so it 's hard not to include it . Quibbles aside , there 's so much else on here that it 's hard to complain -- including two very early and eerily good Jimmie Rodgers covers , with haunting guitar work , that make one wonder what Gene might have produced in his long life if Hollywood had n't gotten hold of him . Hi ho , Champ !
 This is a terrific album and definitely the place to start a Gene Autry collection . Disc 1 is pure magic . The sound is clearer than on the previous 1992 single disc Essential release and the performances have a marvellously unadorned simplicity and charm . It does n't get better than this anywhere.Disc 2 is also very good although not quite up to the standard of Disc 1 . While very listenable , the 10 tracks from the late 40s/early 50s do n't have quite the sparkle of the earlier recordings . If I had my way , I 'd substitute a half-dozen earlier recordings -LRB- Old Faithful , Dust , The Last Roundup , Pardon for Daddy , Red River Valley & Blueberry Hill -RRB- in place of later recordings like Ghost Riders in the Sky , God Bless America , Goodnight Irene , Roly Poly , On Top of Old Smokey & Old Soldiers Never Die . But that 's a small quibble . Sony are to be commended for this excellent addition to the Columbia Legacy series .
 Exclent , we need to go back to the values Gene Autry showed
 I recently purchased the Essential Gene Autry 40 Historic Tracks from Amazon.com , via the internet , and have been totally thrilled , with many of the tunes featured on the two Cd collection , that I have never heard before.These Cd 's is a must for ALL Gene Autry fans world-wide , as not only does it give a full account of his Entire Columbia Records Career but it features some of those unique historic tracks taken from the old 78rpm recordings made in his younger years.You can reminise with Gene as he portrays `` The Life Of Jimmie Rodgers '' , `` Dallas County Jail '' , `` Dear Old Western Skies '' , the very popular `` Amapola '' , to the sentimental all time favourite of many , `` That Silver-Haired Daddy Of Mine , to `` When It 's Sprintime In The Rockies '' just to mention a few gems from the 20 tunes on Cd One.Then theres even more Nostalgia with Gene on Cd two , with the likes of Oklahoma Hills , the bouncy `` Sioux City Sue '' , `` Roly Poly , plus not to forget `` God Bless America '' sung in true Cowboy fashion as only Gene Autry can master , and if you 're still looking for more golden tunes , then listen to `` On Top Of Old Smokey '' another that I played oh so often from a 78rpm , then you must check out the song made popular in later years by Dinah Shore , `` Buttons And Bows '' this is another treat from Gene , presented in true Cowboy singing style.To close off the second Cd of 20 memorable tunes , are two famous all-time Christmas greats , `` Here Comes Santa Claus '' and Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer '' , just to add even more lust and sentimental value to the Two Cd Album of Essentially Gene Autry.Finally , I take my hat off to `` Columbia Records '' for this long awaited treasured release in respect of `` The Singing Cowboy - Gene Autry , as I can say , Gene himself would be over the moon and possible , -LRB- singing on the moon -RRB- , if he were to be able to listen to his famous collection of tunes today.I most certainly recommend this collection for ALL fans of Gene Autry to have in your home library.Robbie Ferguson , Christchurch , New Zealand .
 Excellent !!!! A gift for my Mother after my Father died last March . It 's the only music she likes to listen to now and I was so happy to find all of the songs she loves on one CD - Thanks !!!
 Granny loved hearing all the old songs.Some of them she had n't heard in years .
 If you are into early country music , some of the best songs and the premier singer of the day are included in the CD .
 IT 'S GOOD HEARING GENE SING AGAIN . I ALWAYS ENJOYED HIS STYLE AND VOICE .
 If you like hard and fast punk rock , 3 simple chords , loads of energy , catchy lyrics and plenty of hatred , get into this . Classic punk rock/Oi . Not the best punk band ever , but very high up there . Grab it . Its full on . My only beef is that I am not into live recordings .
 This is a very impressive cd , it shows some of the many talents that this wonderful , talented , singer has.She does 14 songs and all are great and she has a good variety of stuff here.It is a good cd for a starter to this artist and her music . This album has been out for awhile now but it is easily worth the price .
 Rosand 's tone is enough to make your heart melt.But his musicality is just as impressive , and here , finally in excellent sound with an excellent orchestra , he gives us a wonderful set of Brahms and Beethoven violin concerti.For Brahms , I still like Milstein a lot -LRB- with Steinberg , on EMI -RRB- . To me , Milstein and Rosand have similar tone qualities , but they are definitely different musicians . For Beethoven I appreciate Kremer with Haroncourt -LRB- Teldec -RRB- and for an almost downright raw approach with an `` interesting '' orchestral accompaniment , Tetzlaff with Gielen on a super-cheapie label -LRB- Point Classics ; coupled with one of the most boring renditions of Beethoven 's 2nd PC I 've ever endured -RRB- . Acquire this album . Enjoy it . Treasure it . I sure have .
 Five stars for this extraordinary recording from legendary violinist Aaron Rosand . I love this CD ; if it were an LP I would have worn it out already . In fact , it 's my favorite thing to buy and give my friends right now . It has also had great reviews in Fanfare and Strad magazine
 Rosand is splendid in both masterpieces of the violin literate . First honors go to the Beethoven
 This is my favorite recording of the Beethoven . Rosand 's playing is so exciting , and his ability to retain the structural integrity of the piece is so complete , that when I heard his performance for the first time it was a revelatory experience.I also recommend his complete Bach sonatas and partitas , and his complete Beethoven violin sonatas . The Bach and the Beethoven/Brahms were recorded when Rosand was 71 years old ! There 's virility and enthusiasm in his playing , which is both incandescent and intellectual at the same time . I found his Tchaikovsky to be a disappointment , but nobody 's perfect !
 This recording is so expressive , so pure , and so truly musical it 's a rare pleasure to experience . I 've owned many interpretations of these concertos , but this is by far the most soulful , masterful , moving , and touching I have ever heard .
 When I first listened to this disc I compared it to other recordings I know , and I was , frankly , disappointed . In the Beethoven I missed Kreisler 's sweetness of tone , Hahn 's immaculate rhythm and intonation , and Chung 's blazing emotion . The Brahms seemed tame compared to Mutter 's 1997 tour de force . In addition , a minor flub in the first few bars of the Beethoven turned me off early on.However , this disc has since grown on me , for the best of reasons
 I have always admired the playing of Aaron Rosand but have generally associated him with violinistic fireworks , not the meat-and-potatoes works of the violin literature . But what two concerti could be more mainstream than the Beethoven and the Brahms ? So , here I was expecting good but not great performances from Rosand and , let 's face it , a second-tier orchestra -LRB- the Monte Carlo Philharmonic -RRB- under a conductor I 'd never heard of before , Derrick Inouye.First , a word about Rosand 's sound . The tones he produces on his G-string are are rich and lustrous as any I know . His upper range is preternaturally brilliant , and his mid-range is stronger , richer and warmer than I seem to recall . This was recorded in 1999 if I 'm not mistaken , so this is later Rosand than I 've heard before , so maybe he 's one of those artists who continues to grow over time . Whatever the reasons , the sound of the violin on this recording is as good as it gets.Rosand has never been one to linger in beautiful tone , though . He has always been a player who got on with it . Both these quintessential violin concertos benefit from that ; they have , it seems to me , been played more and more slowly and ` meaningfully ' over the fifty years or so that I 've been hearing performances of them . -LRB- Although , I must admit a recent concert performance of the Beethoven I heard with Jaime Laredo playing and conducting was of the same ` stick to business ' style and benefited thereby . -RRB- It 's as if Rosand has brushed away the cobwebs -- or perhaps it would be more appropriate to say that he washed off the accretion of treacle that has adhered to these two concerti . This is not to say that either concerto sounds rushed . Rather , each sounds -- here 's that word again -- ` meaningful ' in a musical rather than sentimental sense . It is as if one is hearing these so-familiar works anew . It 's hard to think of a better compliment than that.Whatever the reasons , I find these two performances to now be among my favorites . And all this for less that $ 10 . That would seem to me to suggest a ` buy ' recommendation.Scott Morrison
 Larnelle is listened to often and I had never seen this album before.It is great I am glad to add it to my collection .
 Nothing beats this collectors edition for Larnelle fans . We sing along with all the songs and now our children are loving them too .
 every song in this collection is inspiring ! One of my all time favorites . All of the songs are good , unlike some collections that only have a few good ones ...
 Larnelle provides a powerful voice in Christian music . He hits the notes and offers a rich textured sound that is truly special . I encourage anyone who appreciates inspiring lyrics and excellent vocals to get this collector 's series .
 This is one of the most wonderful Brandenburg sets I ever have listened to -LRB- Including Tafelmusik , Goodman , Chamber orchestra of europe , Orch age enlightment , Hogwood , Leppard -LRB- best of traditional versions , superb -RRB- , Richter -RRB- . It has great freshness , dinamic pulse and spontaneus vitality . And those virtues are consistently maintained along the whole set . Of course not always everything sounds like what one would like -LRB- for when you listen several versions , you begin to draw an `` ideal version '' -RRB- because interpreters will not have the same oppinion that you , eg the last movement of the 6th -LRB- I would have liked a more `` demonic '' or `` maniac '' pulse , but it 's fine as it is -RRB- , or the not ideal `` hooty '' oboe sound in the 1st concerto.You have strenght and vigour
 Truly inspired revelations about this music , especially from the wind instruments and the contrabasse . -LRB- Do listen on something that will give you bass sound without stint . -RRB- The Allegro from the Third is the most exciting music I 've heard since Biondi 's marvelous assault -- and I use the word advisedly -- on Vivaldi 's Four Seasons . If we could hear things played this way in the concert hall , we 'd go there more often . Do n't miss it . Find it somewhere , somehow and wonder !
 This is strong and well-produced pop music in the Raspberries and Paul Simon school . In a modern context it 's difficult to hear this keyboard centric work and not hear Ben Folds -LRB- particularly the voice , but comfortably outside of what they necessarily means overall as Folds makes clear his love of classic pop writer Todd Rundgren , and this runs more into aforementioned mentors . Just kinda amazed this is n't more popular , it 's way too catchy .
 After seeing Sister Carol in San Francisco last nightI had to get the CD right away . I listened to it all night and could not stop . Besides putting on one of the best concerts I have ever seen , she continue to deliver on her `` Promises , Promises '' with a stellar CD . Once again , Isis
 Sister Carol 's feminine , rich , baritone , harmonious voice along with her heavy roots lyrics firmly establish that she is the righteous `` Rasta Mother Nature . '' Two-thirds of the songs on `` Original Woman '' are so solid and incredible that it 's hard to believe she could release an album of this magnitude in one year . If you dig this , check out `` Lyrically Potent '' as well .
 I must admit I listened to the first track and fell in love with it . I am a dedicated listener of guitar players Steve Vai , Joe Satriani and eric johnson . Darren has done a great job playing something that anyone would listen to . Sometimes words get in the way , and just listening to calming music allows you to free your mind , relax , and center yourself . Darren is a way to obtain that wonderful center again . Listen and you will not be disapointed .
 Darin has done us all a great favor in sharing his music with us . He is masterful with the guitar and his spirit comes out in the music . The result is an album that is relaxing , soothing , yet energizing ... creates pictures in my mind of happy places , happy thoughts ... so hard to explain . I just do n't think I could ever get tired of this one . `` Sunshine '' has the happiest sound ; `` Goodnight '' is a beautiful melody to end the day . My Mom was in the hospital and I brought the album to her to listen to and she absolutely LOVED it -- it made her feel better and be able to imagine she was somewhere else . I ca n't recommend it enough . Truly , this will not disappoint . Listen at the end of a stressful day - light a candle , relax , and just breathe .
 This aptly tightled and carefully crafted album welcomes you in , and welcomes you back for every listening with true Aloha . I 'm lucky enough to number some of Hawaii 's legendary guitarists as good friends - but this album is unique.It rightly prioritizes guitar pyrotechnics -LRB- yes , even slack key has its technicians -RRB- for lush and lovely melodies that blend Hawaii and the West , in a deeply emotional but spare technique that accentuates rather than dulls the gorgeous simplicity.A landmark album that may mark a vibrant new era in an increasingly cluttered slack key pantheon . -LRB- Are the traditionalists listening ? -RRB- It stands the deepest scrutiny but , more importantly , gives a sense of enchantment and freshness that is so often missing in today 's musical offerings.Hats off to Darin for a spectacular debut.Tim Dick / Lanikai
 Although the releases have tended to fly under the radar of international music reviewers record companies such as Pan Classics and Gallo have continued to devote attention to the Swiss composer Raffaele d'Alessandro -LRB- 1911-1959 -RRB- . I can understand why . D'Alessandro may not be a deeply original composer or a composer of the absolute first rank among twentieth century masters , but on the evidence of the music on this disc his music is very compelling , excellently crafted , imaginative and certainly worth the attention of lovers of twentieth century music in general . D'Alessandro studied with Boulanger and Dupr&eacute; and his music is primarily neo-classical but full of energy and vitality , sometimes suggesting -LRB- perhaps -RRB- Bart&oacute;k and - more obviously - French music of the time -LRB- Les Six , Ibert , Sauguet -RRB- . The first symphony is a concentrated , spirited work in four movements ; its material may not be the most memorable , but it is tautly constructed and not once is the listener bored or tempted to question the composer 's choices . Overall it makes a pretty convincing impression . The Concerto no. 3 for piano and orchestra -LRB- `` quasi una sinfonia '' -RRB- opens with a complex , long main theme - which contains enough developmental potential for all four movements and does , in part , reappear throughout . Overall the work strikes one as a symphony with piano obbligato more than a concerto , but it is no less effective for that - it is ingeniously constructed and quite compelling , although I suppose it is not as instantly impressive as the symphony.As fillers we get half of the 24 preludes for piano op. 30 ; variegated , colorful pieces influenced by French music , particularly Ravel , filtered through Bartokian rhythms and harmonies . It is , again , fascinating , music , and makes one regret that we could n't have all 24 . The performances by Karl-Andreas Kolly make a convincing case without quite generating all the glittering splendor and energy one suspects the piano parts could benefit from . The Basler Sinfonie-Orchester under Mario Venzago likewise lack just a little in color and energy but does an overall impressive job . A very recommendable release ; if the style -LRB- tonal , slightly dissonant , predominantly neo-classical twentieth century music -RRB- appeals I urge you to try it , and even if it is n't generally your cup of tea I do not think you would regret sampling it .
 While `` Mother 's Spiritual '' is as far removed from `` New York Tendaberry '' as imaginable , where NYT was aggressive , sad , frantically emotional , and sometimes disturbing -LRB- though ultimately satisfying -RRB- , MS is gentle , flowing , reassuring and nurturing . It 's an exquisite piece of work with a continual flow , and it 's a true shame that Columbia/Sony has not seen fit to release this title on CD . -LRB- It was only been released as a rare German import over a decade ago . -RRB-
 I will be breif as the other reviews also state the case very well , but any fan of Laura 's should own this CD . I have had it since the day it came out and it gets better with each succesive listen . Laura continued to make great music througout her carreer and this is one of her finest , most personal , works lyrically . However , it is the melodies that rival her greatest works and will continue to bury themselves into your skull until they rest within your soul . Let 's face it , soul is what this beautiful and sensitive woman was ultimately all about . Her passing has been one of the most profound losses of my life . Some may think that strange as I never met the woman but her music always spoke passionately to me . That wonderful music is her legacy and any fan must own this album . It is discraceful that Sony has not seen fit to release this CD domestically but this Line import is priced reasonably so what are you waiting for ?
 I 've just started listening to pre - `` Smile '' Nyro , so I can see how people can be split between these two phases of her work . Her earlier work seems more ambitious and urban , while her later work is more melodic and nature-themed . It 's unfortunate that the two best albums from her later period -LRB- `` Nested '' and `` Mother 's Spiritual '' -RRB- are so hard to find . It makes it difficult to see that her later period was just as worthwhile as her celebrated early albums.Anyway , if you like Laura Nyro 's latter phase -LRB- from `` Smile '' on -RRB- , then this CD is a must . Get it while you can ! It 's the best work she crafted from this period . Every song has something very concrete to say in beautiful poetic language and , lyrically , `` Mother 's Spiritual '' is Nyro 's most open album . Several songs are about becoming a mother and dealing with motherhood and , as usual , there are a couple political songs and Nyro is not shy about what she thinks . However , I find that her straightforward , unpretentious presentation prevents any of these songs from becoming crabby public service announcements -LRB- like Joni Mitchell or other former sixites icons work seems to get -RRB- . However , good themes are nothing without good music and Nyro delivers all the way through the CD . All these songs are a joy to listen to . The overall tone of the record is very light and focuses on Laura 's piano playing and voice , using the other musicians to fill out the sound and vary things somewhat.On this CD , you will understand why people on the Bottom Line CD kept shouting for her to play `` To a Child '' . What a heartfelt song ! `` A Free Thinker '' speaks to following ones own path with tight musicianship and great harmonies . `` Mother 's Spiritual '' is , in my opinion , Laura 's most beautiful piece of writing and performing . These are my favorites , but there are few songs that do n't feel very strongly about.A wonderful , hard to find CD . If you like Laura Nyro , do not hesitate to pay the extra buck to snatch this up . There is no CD like it , and it is so worth the import price !
 ` Mother 's Spiritual ' was released in 1984 , and stands as one of Laura Nyro 's most consistent efforts . The overall sound renders a sort of sophisticated easy-listening experience , and the messages convey a pacifist , motherly , Mother Earth-loving dialog . There is an abundance of soft , smooth-flowing , gentle , soothing compositions , often supported with a jazzy , quick-strum electric guitar rhythm . While many of the songs do not exercise Laura 's vocal cords as diligently as , say ` Billy 's Blues ' , she is obviously in fine voice . In a unique twist , Laura credits herself with providing `` harmonics '' , her own overdubbed background vocals on a number of tracks . ` Mother 's Spiritual ' is , at the time of this writing , one of the rarest and most expensive CD 's being sold at Amazon . I used a similarly hard-to-find cassette tape to make this review . Not many of the songs can be found on other discs . In fact , studio versions of the title track and ` To a Child ' are only available on a Japanese import CD called ` Premium Best ' . Live versions of those two tracks , along with ` Trees of the Ages ' and ` Sophia ' can be found on a number of Nyro 's late 1980 's and later CD 's , including ` The Loom 's Desire ' , ` Live In Japan ' , and ` Live At the Bottom Line ' . That means that only 4 of the 14 tracks are available in some format other than on this disc itself . Not a situation to make happy campers out of Laura 's rather rabid fan base.The best songs on ` Mother 's Spiritual ' are , for the most part , those Laura chose to include in her concert setlists . ` To a Child ' , capturing both the joys and trials of parenting -LRB- `` so serene , read about us in a magazine , then why are we crying at the washing machine ? '' -RRB- , became a fan favorite at Laura 's latter performances , and with good reason
 I first heard Laura Nyro about 20 years ago on some station I picked up while driving through Jersey , which happened to play a whole side of `` Eli and the 13th Confession '' . Although I 'd never heard her , I guessed it had to be her , because it sounded just like Todd Rundgren , who tends to make people sound like him , and I knew they did a record together at one point . Follow me ? Anyway , `` Mother 's Spiritual '' was the record that they did together , not `` Eli . . '' , so it became obvious that she was the one that influenced him . He even wrote a song about her on one of his early records called `` Laura . `` Anyway , getting back to `` Mother 's Spiritual '' , her voice sounds more refined than her earlier stuff like `` Eli and the 13th Confession '' , which seems to be universally considered a masterpiece , and to me , it sounds a little more in the direction of Joni Mitchell 's `` Hissing of Summer Lawns '' and just as consistent . It 's beautiful from beginning to end.My favorite line happens to be '' ... why are we cryin ' by the washing machine ? , '' which someone referred to earlier , and when it slips back into that melody at the very end , it 's just brilliant . On the tape that I listen to repeatedly , which I had to transfer from a crackly used record I found for $ 1.00 , I made the end keep fading in a few times ; the record 's so beautiful I did n't want it to end . I guess I could say the same thing about Laura 's career ; the only time I got to see her play was through the window of a club while I stood outside in the rain , because I was $ 5.00 short for the cover charge . Still hurts to think about it .
 Laura Nyro 's `` Mother 's Spiritual '' is a classic CD for me , one of my favorites . I was one of the `` tribe '' while Laura was alive , purchasing the LP on Columbia as soon as it was released and picked up the West German CD so I could soundtrack my time in the car , as I did this week . What an exquisite work this . I think 5 of these tracks are among Nyro 's best . The opener `` To A Child '' is an exquisite homage to parents who get tired and still have to take care of the kids . When Laura breaks into the gorgeous hook on the chorus , `` What is life ? Did you read about it in a magazine ? Silent lies never give you what you need ; Is there hope for a mother and an elf on speed ? '' What a glorious description of those bundles of energy that children are ! `` Melody in the Sky '' is another delightful track with the lovely percussion on the arrangement and Laura 's passionate vocals , part hush , part wave , `` Lover , I 'm your friend and tonite your melody ; and you own yourself ; I belong to me . '' I once sent a CD to Bonnie Raitt with songs I 'd hope she 'd cover one day . My recommendation was `` Free Thinker '' which may not be the most melodically complex of Laura 's tunes , but is one I connect with repeatedly . Laura 's voice floats into the stratosphere , `` You could shine your special light ! '' `` The Brighter Song '' is another fabulous gem that swoons to embrace you , `` You are stronger , brighter , Your dream 's a little wilder , Sister believe , sister believe in your happiness . '' `` Mother 's Spiritual '' is Laura 's anthem that is glorious , `` Feel this love , my brothers and sisters , feel the season turn , she is the mother of time . '' The other tracks are also delights like `` Sophia , '' `` Man in the Moon '' and `` Late for Love . '' This set is nearing 25 years since it was first released . It is soothing to my soul . Bravo !
 During the 1980s , Laura Nyro spent most of the time with her young son Gil , and `` Mother 's Spiritual '' was the only recording she released between 1979 and 1988 . Nestedhad been a commercial disaster owing to the `` punk revolution '' tightening playlists and leaving her without a media outlet , but `` Spiritual '' with hindsight came out at a much more favourable time with the emergence of such artists asKate Bushandthe Cocteau Twinswho took much -LRB- whether consciously or not -RRB- from her masterpieces likeChristmas and the Beads of Sweat.Given this , and the development of college radio to counter the stifling restrictiveness of late 1970s commercial radio , it is hardly surprising that `` Mother 's Spiritual '' fared better commercially than `` Nested '' , briefly denting the Top 200 - though one does at times think it could have done better.Since its release `` Spiritual '' has received a good deal of criticism from the press
 `` A mother of an album '' -- I read an interview a while back w / Laura where she talked about the process of writing the songs for ` mother 's spiritual . ' When I consider that she would typically wake up in the middle of the night , after probably a stressful day of child rearing or what have you , and jot down lyrical snippets on the back of matchbooks -LRB- or sometimes even her hand -RRB- , it 's easy to see how it turned out to be such a mellow record ... . sort of a peaceful refuge after the craziness of the day . When I think about the album in those terms , I tend to appreciate it to its fullest , and sometimes even consider it one of Laura 's greatest achievements . Oftentimes , the melodies of ` spiritual ' -LRB- if not the complete songs -RRB- will fly through my head for no reason at the strangest times ... . maybe not as often as the blaring horns of ` dark mornings , ' the gypsy trumpet of ' i am the blues ' or the double guitar thrush at the end of ` my innocence , ' but often enough .
 I began listening to Laura Nyro when she first appeared in 1966 . When she released Eli & The 13th Confession , she became one of the most magical singer/songwriters of her time . As she progressed through her career , she released some of the most remarkable music ever recorded in the rock genre . Mother 's Spiritual is among her very best in my opinion . Right up there with Eli & The 13th Confession if I dare say . Disagree ? It 's my opinion , okay ? I was lucky enough to find a copy when it was out of print , sitting in one of those discount CD racks at a gas station . I had never heard it but bought it and put it in my car CD player . It stayed there for weeks , nothing could displace it . The material on this album is some of the very best material she ever wrote and recorded . Sometimes , it is so beautiful it is emotionally overwhelming and it makes me smile to think that someone so remarkable has been a part of the song of my life . I know that many of us who loved Laura Nyro feel the same and place her music at the apex of rock . This one belongs with the best of her works . If you love Laura and have missed this one , get it .
 I bought this in tape version on a fluke and was I totally knocked out . While I like Laura and her writing , her albums sometimes bored me -LRB- in an alliance w / Monterray -RRB- and used to find myself straining to hear . NOT THIS ONE - It runs , it moves and she really swings in it yet it has the depth and sentimental value of her best and says an awful lot about a treasured subject - Motherhood - her statements are totally great .
 I am a long-time Laura Nyro fan , listener ... whatever . But , I had always shied away from her later-period material - and this release in particular - because of the album 's expressed `` theme '' or `` concept ''
 This review is of the June 2009 Iconoclassic remastered version of the album . Finally , an affordable version on CD - and of excellent audio quality , I might add.Some of the reviews make mention of the style change in Ms. Nyro 's music pre and post her Smile album and I agree . Mother 's Spiritual continues in that post-smile style and myself , I love all of her albums . The lyrics in this one are as personal as any of her other albums and the songs are quite melodic . This is another must-have for all Laura Nyro fans . I would say that it is also more `` accessible '' than her earlier works because of the melodies and more conventional tempos of the songs.Also included are excellent and incisive liner notes from Michelle Kort , and complete lyrics.It 's one totally beautiful album from a beautiful person . Big thanks to Iconoclassics for doing such a fine job of remastering !
 When this was first released my children were tottlers . I actually heard this on a Jazz radio station . It just hits directly to the heart of any young parent . Laura had the gift of lyrics and music that made this CD so special . Although , my kids are grown I can put this on and it takes me back to the simpler days when my kids listened to me . I 've been searching for this CD for such a long time , I was thrilled to see it released , on Japanese import . The audio quality is great . Grab this CD while it is available . This and First Songs , brings Laura 's music full circle and demonstrates what a talent she was ... a very special gift to mankind . Enjoy Enjoy you will not be disappointed .
 I 've been waiting to here this entire record for some time . It a was recorded after a break from the music business to have a child . Some of her earlier works went on to become bigger hits by other artists . I ca n't see anyone doing a better job than Laura did on these tunes . Todd Rundgren has been influenced by Laura since the late 60 's and comes on board to help produce and play on some the songs . Great from start to finish . I 'm so glad this record has finally been re-released so it can be enjoyed by those who may have missed it the first time around .
 I was vacumming my front when I put this on the stereo for some entertainment . Well the vacuum was really loud so I missed a lot but what I did hear was very very funny . In fact at one point my 3 kids came in the room and asked what I was laughing at . I played a part of the CD for them and they started jumping up and down with joy and laughter . They could not help themselves . We all us just laughed and laughed . Then my ex wife came in the room and took them home and left me alone with that CD . It was no longer funny but it was n't his fault . Highest rating for this !
 This is destined to be classic . Stand-up hijinx from the man who brought you `` pickle potato '' , `` hot dog on a stick '' , Art Huckman , and oodles of `` blue '' humor . This album will leave you dead with compulsive laughter .
 This comedy compact disc is unbelievable ! It just shows that Neil can wow the audiences world wide with his keen wit . He can wow people who do n't even speak English ... he 's just that good . He breaks down all the barriers and gets personal with a group of non-english speaking folks . It is inspirational . It is also his longest CD ever . Please enjoy it !
 Hats off to Neil Hamburger ! This priceless Malaysian routine showcases Neil 's gift as a comedian ; to endure through hard-luck and to let us know about it ! Hey ! It 's a classic . Hurray for Neil !!
 Third time is the CHARM ! Neil comes through with flying colors . The only thing I miss is `` She sits in the cabbage and peas '' . Way to Go !!!! Neil .
 This record really showcases Niel 's strengths - the jokes
 This is one of the greatest comedy cd 's yet . It also happens to be Neil Hamburger 's longest cd to date . If you love comedy , then try out a Neeeeiiilll Haaaammmburger !!! CD .
 This album is a riot ! I just saw Neil Hamburger in Perth Australia , opening up for Frenzal Rhomb . Brilliant !
 I listen to Neil hamburger especially in his more upbeat types . i do prefer the more mellow music sometimes with guitar but the Malaysia is the best yet
 I have just about every recording Janowitz made , on records and CDs . Unfortunately , there are not enough of them , as she recorded less than other great singers . To me , her voice is gorgeous , her delivery ideal . If you are not familiar with her , her voice will be a revelation . BUY THIS SET .
 This is a magnificen set . The Mozart was an amazing surprise for the sheer opulence and drama that it is conveyed in every note and nuance . Cd 4 wth its German arias is outstanding . Although the Parsifal escerpt I found an odd choice . I would have prefered the inclusion of a R. Strauss aria or scene . But you ca n't have everything and this set just about has this status already . Let 's be greatful to DDG for this release .
 Borrowed the album off a friend . I thought one or two tunes hit the spot but with successive playings the whole album took on a mesmerising effect . I 've since played the grooves off and bought all their other CDs on speculation . The lyrics are mischievious , funny , delinquent and at times surreal . I 've been spreading the good word about the CD and now most visitors to my place know who they 're going to hear a lot of . By the way after several weeks I finally returned the CD and bought my own . Probably my favourite CD of the last four years . My recommendation is try it , persevere with it and buy it . You 'll like it ! ` Quench ' also approaches this CD for quality but falls slightly short in lyrical deviousness .
 This British group 's bright and clear pop sound complements their sharp and acidic lyrics surprisingly well . The best example is the disturbingly upbeat and cheery backing to ` Should 've Kept My Eyes Shut ' which gives a grim glimpse of domestic violence.The album opens with the sweeping sound in ` Tonight I Fancy Myself ' , which refers to , among other things , lost legs and a `` partly severed head '' . ' A Little Time ' , the beautifully simple single with an intriguing film clip , should become a classic tale of lover versus lover . Dave Hemingway and Briana Corrigan make it more of a duel than a duet.Again , sounding like we 're about to hear a happy Madness or Style Council-esque tune , Hemingway sings of `` ugly babies '' and admits to failure in ` Book ' . This contrast is used almost throughout and works well right to the final track , ' I Hate You Tonight -LRB- But You 're Interesting -RRB- ' . Housemartins Paul Heaton and Hemingway launched The Beautiful South in 1989 and this is the outfit 's second album . Second albums are notoriously disappointing . Not this one .
 If I believed that this is the music that was in the hearts of its creators ; that is to say when they picked up a guitar or sat at the piano and this was a true expression of their soul I 'd diagnose them insane . I use the term according to Webster . The insanity of resentment dripping from every offering on this record has provided me with a compelling account of dysfunction for the past 17 years regardless of my level of emotional maturity .
 A terrific little album that explores folk , blues , banjos , and beats -LRB- one song , track 3 , with an electronic beat that reminds me of Beth Orton -RRB- . Overall I 'd say that her style is her own and it 's difficult to compare her with anyone specific . The lyrical content is simple and does n't leave a great deal to the imagination , but her soulful expressivness more than makes up for it . Solid from begining to end , I 'd recomend this album to anyone that wants to feel as if they are part of the album they are listening to , as if she is singing straight to you . I do n't know what the Polish poster before me said , but I imagine it was very good .
 Excellent example of good , almost southern folk rock , with a touch of mountain music thrown in . Consistent style throughout . Good for anyone new to Laura Veirs -LRB- her music is a little different everytime !! -RRB- A good listen .

 As a former voice teacher and choir director I am forever telling my students how singers are telling a story and if you ca n't sell the story not only are you in for a long concert but those people that paid money to see you are in for an even longer concert . Camille not only tells it but she sells it as well . One of my many frustrations with American Idol -LRB- or with my young students -RRB- is that all too often they believe all one must do is open their mouth and sing some words . NO ! It 's about expression and delivery . Check out Camille 's CD if you want to learn about expression and delivery . That 's what story telling/singing/performing is all about . Music should move you . The last song on the CD `` The Last Day '' is so beautiful that I wish it would have been released as a single by her . It is worth buying the CD just for that song . Camille 's voice has matured over the years and it is a delight to hear where she is now . I like every song on the CD and I think you will also .
 This soundtrack to a Dutch installation utilizes electronic sounds which are familiar to any fan of modern Musique Concrete , but does so in a way which is totally unique to Gregory Alan Taylor 's way of working . Variable , changable electronic looping is used to make the sounds almost rhythmic , giving them an internal drive and imposing a tautological order on otherwise random sounds . This creates a sense of purpose and even peace out of the ur-chaos . The overall effect is very restrained and controlled , even though the source material appears to be randomly drawn noises from the world around us . It is an odd dichotomy , an oxymoron of sound , a dialectical exploration of form within disarray .
 I have been a fan of Jennifer Larmore ever since her early , spectacular recording of Handel 's `` Julius Caesar , '' but have unfortunately never seen her sing . This video , then , fills an important gap in my collection , and I can not praise it highly enough . Larmore is both a fine artist and an entertaining singer
 This movie puts spice back in your relationship and takes you down paths that you fantasize about . Perfect for couples .
 You start the car , put it in gear , stick this CD in the the player , turn up the volume and next thing you know Coco Montoya blasts you with `` Ca n't Get My Ass in Gear . '' Before you know it you 're a hundred miles down the road . This is a fantastic road trip CD , some cuts are better than others . It starts on a strong note and ends on a nostalgic one with Canned Heat 's '' On the Road Again . '' In between you have tunes such as Jimmy Thackery and the Drivers ' `` Drive to Survive '' and Mike Morgan and the Crawl 's `` The Road . '' There are a few tracks I would like to add , for example Jimmy Thackery 's `` Doin ' 100 '' and `` Mercury Blues '' or Little Mike and the Tornadoes ' `` Drivin ' All Day to Play the Blues All Night '' or `` Drivin ' 85 . '' Nonetheless if you pickup this CD , you 'll soon be `` on the road again . ''
 I hate to see everyone ignoring such a stellar release . Selling this CD for a penny ?! All I can tell you is to buy it . I promise you will find more than one song that will brings you joy , a couple that will inspire you to move along and others that will just plain touch your heart of hearts . Loaded with melody , sincere vocals and spot on harmonies . Wonderful songs written for the most part by band members Mead Cheseboro and Rob Bender with some help from CCM stalwarts Mike Roe -LRB- 77 's -RRB- , Terry Taylor -LRB- Daniel Amos , Lost Dogs , etc -RRB- and Gene Eugene -LRB- Adam Again , Lost Dogs , etc -RRB- and produced by the latter two . So what are you waiting for ? Plunk down your penny and get some seriously celebratory tunes !!
 This is a great cd . It gives you the feel of `` The Wonders '' in THAT THING YOU DO .
 I have been listening to this album for years , and I absolutely love it . I honestly do n't know why they are n't famous by now . I could listen to them all day ! Wish they would 've gone on to make more albums .
 This is a fantastic album . I am so happy to see it on Amazon . I received as a birthday gift back in 2000 and no one knew what it was . I searched everywhere to learn about the album and never did until recently . ONLY $ .01 !! Buy this and enjoy . Truly a work of art.N
 This is a review for the single DVD version.This DVD offers a rather frustrating look at Pink Floyd w / Syd Barrett . Syd Barrett remains an elusive figure , and certainly that 's always been part of his charm . Very little film/video remains of Syd Barrett playing w / Pink Floyd , so I was eager to say the least to check this out . In my opinion , the video of `` Interstellar Overdrive '' is worth the price of this DVD . But be forewarned , real good looks at Syd are few and fleeting ! And what becomes obvious is the ambivalence he had playing before an audience . As the singer , composer and lead guitarist , you 'd expect Syd to be there , front and center . Nothing is predictable w / Syd ever . He lurks in the shadows turned away from the audience often enough . There is Pink Floyd on an unlit stage at the UFO club where they made their mark as part of the London Underground scene . The camera zooms to Syd 's face , but in the darkness , you ca n't see it AT ALL . Instead of `` where 's Waldo ? '' it 's `` where 's Syd ? '' You will feel like a detective trying to find him.The more revealing views come during the scenes of the band jamming @ the Sound Techniques Studio . Like others have said , the audio has been remastered to perfection . As Interstellar Overdrive revs toward the finale , you see Syd , who has been curled over seated in a chair , looking up and over to Rick Wright on keyboards . That personal exchange between musicians has never been evident on stage with Pink Floyd in their entire career . They always said Syd was closest to Rick , and you see the supporting evidence right here . Then , as the song finishes , Syd throws his arm up in the air as a final flourish . There 's a jump cut , and then you see Syd spent , totally curled over his guitar , enveloped in a waft of cigarette haze . It downright post-coital ! Iconic , surely . Some say this version of `` Interstellar Overdrive '' is the definitive version . It just might be and , even if it is n't , it 's still compelling music over 40 years later . What I especially like about early Floyd is the jazz influence seeping through the psychedelia.As for `` Nick 's Boogie , '' the other musical track , I overlooked it at first . Yeah , extended drum solos ai n't my bag , but that would be pigeon-holing this song . Anyway , having read the liner notes for this DVD , I had to listen as Syd plays slide on this . This song 's got a seriously foreboding edge to it , and somehow it brings to mind the existential anxiety of the film `` Apocalypse Now . '' One of Syd 's trademarks was his truly surreal and astral guitar , and this track is just another example . Drummer Nick Mason 's accompaniment is appropriately laid back and fits in w / Rick Wright 's trippy organ as well . Listening to this , it 's not hard to envision laying in the sun ; it 's 1966 or 67 . You 're a twenty-something wearing colorful paisley clothing , and you 're stoned out of your mind . For sure , this was Syd 's state of mind on a regular basis . So why not join in the fun?If you 're a Syd Barrett fanatic like myself , I would urge you to check this out . Yeah , it could have been better , but it 's still offers some of the magic .
 Pink Floyd live in London 1966/1967 DVD is the art of film , sound , lighting , graphics , people , and places . Interesting looks back in time at the youth of a rock band and the people who came to see them.This time period seems to be no different than the rave culture of the 90s . For the beatles , the who and rolling stones to recognize Pink Floyd as something to be look at and heard , is the turning point to further investigate their talent and where it may go.This DVD shows the studio work and places they performed . It 's a great flash back in time to see a band ahead of its time . This must have been a magical moment for the people who were there to say hey , I was there and look at me now and what did I gain if anything . Haircuts back then look no different than they do today .
 Great CD of one of the most influence band in rock history , if you 're a fan of Pink Floyd , this cd should not miss in your collection .
 esta muy bueno el dvd vi algunas escenas que nunca habia visto esta bien para mi coleccion de pink floyd
 This review is for the Pink Floyd London 1966/1967 DVD only , All Regions edition.This promotional film footage shot by director Peter Whitehead of both Interstellar Overdrive and Nick 's Boogie -LRB- Live/Studio -RRB- is quite interesting and of good sound/video quality . I purchased it for just over $ 10.00 -LRB- USD -RRB- new and well worth it for that cost but it is a bit short though content is great of the early Pink Floyd era . Also , I found the interviews with Mick Jagger , Michael Cain , Julie Christie , and David Hockney interesting to varying degrees along with the cool cameo of John Lennon and the Yoko Ono Happening scenes.In all , it is well worth it if you genuinely dig the early Pink Floyd with Syd Barrett before his mental breakdown -LRB- two extended music jams -RRB- . As a veteran musician myself , I also learned a few things watching this too .
 This video reflects the early years of Pink Floyd . In that time a bunch of innovative guys , mainly Syd probably because his use of sychedelic stuff , trying to bring something new in terms of music . If you are a real fan this would be very rare and interesting but if you expect the late sound of PF with Waters and Gilmour maybe you will feel quite shocked . I rated it 4 because is a short document and the sound is not the best although for this kind of information this is not important , the real value of the video is to see them in the context of a very important moment in the history of pop music .

I rated it 4 because is a short document and the sound is not the best although for this kind of information this is not important , the real value of video is to see them in the context of a very important moment in the history of pop music .
 This video contains surprisingly clear footage of the band performing at the UFO Club in 1966 -LRB- some of it in sync with the audio -RRB- , as well as footage of a `` happening '' in London with John Lennon in the audience hanging out . The total running time is about a half hour . A bit of the psychedelic London of the 60 's preserved for your viewing pleasure ...
 I purchased this tape in Nov. 2000 . At first I was disappointed because the copy sent to me was in PAL format , then I purchased a multi-format VHS VCR so that I could exchange tapes with relatives abroad.The seuences ` echo ' a favored time . Not particularly interesting musically but a historical ` gem ' . I transferred it to NTSC format ; then the soundtrack to Cassette & CD -LRB- with ` Synthesized stereo/Surround ' sound , as the tape is Monophonic -RRB- . Recently I 've made a DVD+R transfer , since a ` commercial ' release is n't available . Good stuff - for fans!!Edd.iegolden@shaw.ca
 This is a movie that you should pop in your VCR when you want to remember Syd and the old 60 's movemente . The thing that I hated about this movie , is that apart from being a Floyd movie , everybody is focused on John Lennon , if people want to see John Lennon they should buy other movies , not this one . This is Floyd and it 's sacred .
 This review is for the Pink Floyd London 66/67 combination two disc DVD/CD set.Quite good , in fact . But viewers should be aware this is not the `` Tonite Let 's All Make Love In London '' movie . It is a combination of filmed portions from that movie , with complete uncut versions of The Pink Floyd performing , `` Interstellar Overdrive '' and `` Nick 's Boogie , '' both from the movie 's sessions , and a second audio disc with remastered versions of both tunes . The DVD includes interviews with Mick Jagger , Michael Caine and others , possibly from the original film -LRB- I have n't seen it -RRB- and Allen Ginsberg reading his poem whose title the movie bears . The CD has about an EP 's worth of material , and the DVD lasts long enough to make you feel you 've watched something . Both tracks are unique , that is ; not album tracks , even though as every Pink Floyd fan knows , a plethora of releases of these tunes are available . The advantages of having this are the DVD and the superior sound.If you 're not sure if this version is the two disc edition , try entering `` Pink Floyd 1966 '' in Amazon 's search box . That will bring up specifically the two disc set . I ca n't tell whether this edition includes the audio-only disc , so I must conclude it does not . You could also write the seller and ask .
 I 've seen nearly everything with syd barrett most bootleg and this is by far the best put together pink floyd movie ever . it has everything london could offer in 1967 including john lennon , if you like syd barrett at all it 's a must have
 This is Pink Floyd . A bunch of guys messing around and producing some wildly creative music . I 'd only recommend this to big Floyd and Barrett fans because half the fun is seeing some of the clubs and shows they played that you 've read about in their books and biographies .
 The only reason I give this video 4 stars is because of its duration -LRB- approx 30 min . -RRB- Otherwise , it is a definite 5 . What sets this tape apart from other Floyd videos is the Syd Barrett factor . Syd Barrett was a founding member of Pink Floyd who took way too many drugs , forcing him to make an unfortunate early departure . In the early days , Syd was the driving force of `` The Pink Floyd '' . This video is an excellent collector 's item , and it is definitely a `` relic '' . On this tape , Pink Floyd psychedelically jams , performing the music of `` Intersteller Overdrive '' and `` Nick 's Boogie '' .
 This is not for people who try synchronizing `` Dark Side of the Moon '' with `` The Wizard of Oz '' . Nor is it for those who think `` Comfortably Numb '' has a `` kick - -LSB- bottom -RSB- solo . '' Nor is it for those expecting live concert footage of Syd Barrett with the band -LRB- although there is a little without sound -RRB- . It 's mainly just shots of Floyd in the studio jamming on `` Interstellar Overdrive '' . The visuals are terrific . In one scene , it shows us rare footage of a Yoko Ono exhibit in which a model has her clothes cut off by scissors . A very interesting look at a very interesting era . However , at just under a half hour , the film leaves much to the imagination . This might be worth it just for footage of Syd , which is hard to come by .
 This is the real thing . This is what the fuss was all about.This is The Pink Floyd , prior to their first record contract , in a studio , in late 1966 . This is the band that blew the Beatles and the Yardbirds away at London unground clubs like Roundhouse , before the media attention , before the Games For May , before their first hit single . This is the unedited footage originally released in shorter length on the 1968 Documentary Film `` Tonite , Let 's Make Love In London . '' Bootleg sound recordings of this circulated for several years in the mid 1980 's before the film saw release on videotape in the late 1980 's , the orginal unedited footage started quasi-legitimate release shortly thereafter . This material has been subsequently released in a myriad of different editions and formats since then.It is amazing that we even have this ; so much of Syd Barrett 's original incarnation of The Pink Floyd was undocumented , unrecorded , that a handful of radio and TV appearances -LRB- that were often lip-synched -RRB- in 1967 and a few alternate or previously unreleased studio tracks -LRB- a few of which were legitimately released 2 years ago on the `` Piper At The Gates 40th Anniversary Edition '' -RRB- are about all that survive to document the original Pink Floyd phenomena . -LRB- Find the rest of them through bit-torrent websites on fan-made and remastered compilations like `` Have You Got It Yet '' Vols . i & 2 , and `` What Syd Wants . '' -RRB- If you are a post-Atom Heart Mother fan of the band , you might not fully appreciate the performances herein , they 're not The Wall , or even Dark Side Of The Moon , they 're a short snapshot of a blazing , groundbreaking group of artists who shook the ground and lifted their thunder to the heavens in London 's nacient psychedelic community , making music and sounds that the world had never heard before . But if you are , and you have n't seen this footage yet , you owe it to yourself to lay down a few of your hard-earned shekels and step 42 years back in time and hear the real , original , Pink Floyd experience .
 This archival video is certainly a must for ANY PF devotee or anyone interested in Psychedelic London circa ' 66 - ' 67 . Pink Floyd 's brilliant -LRB- and tragic -RRB- founder Syd Barrett loomed large at this period -- setting the groundwork for a brand-new movement in Brittish -LRB- and American -RRB- Rock . Unfortunately for Barrett , his stint on the world stage was all-too brief -- yet his indelible legacy is no doubt secure . This rare footage is priceless -- capturing the ambiance of an era -- and the fervency of a major directional change in a fluid art form . It is truly heartrending for those die-hard -LRB- and ancient -RRB- Floyd fans -LRB- myself included -RRB- to see Syd again -- in those long-gone halcyon -LRB- and hallucinogenic -RRB- days of the UFO Club -LRB- and other celebrated venues -RRB- -- to see him at the height of his youthful brilliance -- and make NO MISTAKE about it , HIS was a monumental genuis -- well before the unfortunate return of the schizoprenia that dogged his existance -- brought on , no doubt by the maximum consumptions of acid he was famous for taking . Sadly , the `` Vegetable Man ' became , in the end ... just that . It 's a shame . All of us who grew up in that era nonetheless have an abiding affection for Syd -- and his remarkable work with Pink Floyd . We will always love him . This tape is more than just nostalgia -- it provides an opportunity for some of us to revisit an old friend -- and musical master . Why only four stars and not five ??? Simple -- the tape shouldve been LONGER in duration . It 's THAT historic .
 Diana 's performance of these concertos and those on her other cd 's are something special . She has the gift of singing and speaking with the oboe , and giving pleasure to her listeners . She touches your soul with her magical and wondrous music making .
 Diana Doherty is delightful not only for the ears , but also for the eyes . She makes the music come alive like a cascade of water in the mountains . She brings out it 's soul .
 Diana Doherty from Australia is one of the top oboists in the world . She took first prize in Prague -LRB- ahead of Francois Leleux -RRB- and has a beautiful dark sound . She plays with flair and handles the selections here with ease . Unfortunately this CD appears to be out-of-print . If you want to hear more of Diana Doherty , she has a more recent recording of Romantic oboe concerti : Romantic Oboe Concertos
 I 'm glad that someone still has this Diana Doherty CD in stock . I was n't aware that she had made this recording , having heard the Haydn concerto on ABC Classic FM , the Australian national Classical Music Station last weekend -LRB- 3rd Nov. 2012 -RRB- . It really needs to be re-released as it was made early in her career and has the freshness of approach to any piece she plays . I assure you that she still has this enthusiasm . I have her Australian recordings -LRB- ABC Classics -RRB- which show her beautiful tone and agility on the oboe . My wife and I had the great pleasure of hearing her play with the Queensland Youth Symphony here in Brisbane last year and she also involves herself totally with the music physically as well as in technique , but this never detracts from but rather enhances her performances . There was a vacant seat next to us in the Queensland Performing Arts Centre Concert Hall and imagine the surprise when after her performance she sat there ! We had a great chat . She is such a down to earth person who is a true artist without any ` airs and graces ' . Professionally , besides her recordings , solo recitals and concerto performances , Ms Doherty is Principal Oboist with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra . She also performs with and helps young musicians of all ages e.g. the QYS above . I wholeheartedly recommend any of her recordings or concerts .
 This is a straight reissue of the British compilation `` Big Squeeze '' , featuring a good overview of Squeeze 's best known songs on disc one , and a selection of B-sides and rarities on disc two .
 Excellent EP . The new stuff is expectedly incredible . But the old stuff really gained a lot from the re-record . I noticed the guitar solo in `` Jesus and Tori '' sound a lot different , as with the general tempo of the song , and they kind of muffled the death metal growls , I loved them how they were , but oh well . I also noticed a HUGE improvement in the actual singing . Like , compare when he sings `` Pulling my fingers from these nails '' , in the old one and new one . I think you 'll agree that this is a step up from the last , even if it 's just an EP . I was really missing another song like `` Civeta Dei '' , though .
 This is the newest CD the # 12 looks like you has released . It 's a 5 song EP with 2 new songs , one cover song , and 2 re-recorded songs off there old full length cd . The new songs are just amazing and a step up from there older stuff . This band has so much talent it is ridiculous and there live performance is just amazing . If you like Technical Grind/metal with awesome weird melodies then this is the band for you and you wo n't be dissapointed . They have 2 sings that are just amazing with there vocal ranges and there live performance is awesome . They cover a song on this CD called `` My Sharona '' and it is so cool and kind of funny at the same time . The recording could of been a little better with the guitars at least . The guitars sound a little weak in certain parts -LRB- breakdowns -RRB- but other then that the recording is very good . If you are into bands like Ion Dissonance , Daughters , From A Second Story Window , As The Sun Sets , then you should definitley buy this cd .
 I 'll admit I 'm biased , as I absolutely love this band , but this is a fantastic EP . I was n't too sure about the two tracks they redid from `` Put On Your Rosy Red Glasses '' , but they grew on me . These guys are definitely going places . My favorite new song on this EP is `` Like A Cat '' -- great blend of different kinds of music , and it really showcases their musical talent . The cover of The Knack 's `` My Sharona '' is worth having for novelty value alone , but they really do a nice job.If their goal with this EP was to whet peoples ' appetites for the forthcoming `` Nuclear Sad Nuclear '' album , it worked !
 i ca n't help it , i 'm in love with this little gem of an EP . these songs are at times seemingly completely unstructured , messy , and immature . but at the same time , i love those things about them . it 's extremely energetic , and you can tell these guys are really excited about what they 're doing.what is it that they 're doing ? well , it seems to be taking the all too familiar combination of death and tech -LRB- very trendy these days -RRB- and infusing some -LRB- hate to say it -RRB- emo elements . the result is both very energetic , very unique and EXTREMELY catchy . these songs will get caught in your head . at first i hated them , but with time comes acceptance . i love this album and i think if you 're willing to accept a couple shortcomings you will too .
 Me and my friend must be the only people who actually enjoyed the cover of My Sharona haha . We do n't look at it as `` OMG they totally killed the song '' , I mean honestly its a grindcore band do you think theyd do it like how it originally was ? haha The first time I listened to TNTLLY I was a little confused . It was my first time experiencing this new trend `` grindcore '' . The crazy time signature changes just stunned me so I turned it off , and gave it a second chance later on , and loved it . Now I 'm big into the grindcore scene , it 's what I 've been missing . If this is the first time listening to them , listen to some of their new tracks , then go buy Put On Your Rosy Red Glasses , that is probably the best CD I own . It 's just pure , raw , insane music .
 The Number Twelve is such a good band . you have to have just a good taste of hardcore/metal . they are so random yet so absolutely talented I just want to orgasm . buy all their CD 's .
 Burn Before I Wake Up . what the f *** were you thinking when you typed your review ? i mean , what led your weak and conformative mind to believe that what you typed was something intelligent , and well thought out and researched . because it most obviously was not . you are a racist against music that you are not aware or do n't understand . so you make brash statements like , `` You can pretty much do what they do by hitting a trash can on the ground outside your house and screaming at it . '' I mean , are you serious . what makes you think you have any right to say that ? no , you most definately can not do what they do . by doing anything other than what they have . and what they have done is produced something that is honest and unfiltered . these guys had some raw feelings and emotions and ideas , and they decided to let them go and capture them within a song . that is something that you could most likely never accomplish . and if you do , who gives a damn because you sir , are an ass . and do n't bother writing any thing in response , cause it wo n't change how i feel . i 'm just trying to protect the minds of others from these mis-reviews . that 's right i said it . i have no regrets , and your words are n't worth my time because you obviously ca n't even produce a legit idea or thought that is n't full of unknowing and/or racist ideas . and yes they are racist . but have a wonderful life . no hard feelings . hah . Peace .
 THIS IS HARDCOREif you dont like hardcore stuff dont listen to iti cant believe someone would write that the numer twelve sucksare you kidding me?its rocknot any pansy u2 or somethingTHESE GUYS ARE AWESOMEbuy it if you like hardcore music
 My first exposure to Nikki was on the album `` Tom 's Diner '' which has variations on the originial , and I was excited to hear the unedited version of Nikki 's version . BUTTTTTTTT , some A-hole has decided to `` bless '' this version with edits galore ... including an annoying `` BLEEP '' at one point in the song ! If you do n't want to hear it ... do n't listen to it , or buy it for your `` lily-white '' children in the first place ! Does anyone know if an unedited version exists and , if so , where can I get it ? Great song though ... I guess that I 'll keep searching ... maybe on vinyl !
 I remember when I first heard her flow . It was on a song called `` Lettin ' Off Steam '' and it was on a Def Jam complilation album . The song was so raw and she really represented for da ladies . It sucks that she was an one-hit wonder , but she has been on several artists ' songs and she still got it . Most recently I can think of is Queen Latifah 's album , Order in the Court . I think she 's under Flavor Unit as an artist and writer . But `` Daddy 's Little Girl '' was the song that made her famous .
 NIKKI D WHEN SHE 1ST CAME ON THE SCENE WITH LETTIN OFF STEAM SHE WAS A FEMALE MC NOT TO BE FU / / ED WITH THEN SHE DROPPED DADDYS LIL GIRL FOR ALL THE FEMALES THEN HANG ON KID WHICH WAS TO DATE HER LAST AND HOTTEST SINGLE WHERE O WHERE IS MY NIKKI D
 This is the record his fans have been waiting for , and it 's every bit as good as we dared hope , a more than worthy successor to the four greats from the 70s - Spider Jiving , La Booga Rooga , Be Bop 'n' Holla and Mega Shebang . His songwriting is as strong as ever with a range of styles that shows a deep , deep knowledge of popular music of the last 50 years or more ; that wonderful expressive voice is intact , with phrasing if anything even better than before ; and his guitar playing - who knew ? - is amazing -LRB- see him in action on the Roger Waters and Clapton Unplugged DVDs -RRB- . A triumphant return .
 This album definately lived upto expectations . I also purchased some of the album for gifts and were received with great thanks , and the reivews I had back were very favourable . Definately worth buying !!
 This album is absolutely wonderful , the title tells it all , exactly as it is , Sweet and Soulful.I 've waited a long time for Mr Fairweather-Low to bring us more of his excellent music.It 's full of deep emotion from a superb songwriter.Exactly what his fans have been waiting for .
 For those who do n't know this man -LRB- and far too few do -RRB-
 It 's taken him 26 years to produce a new album but it really is worth the wait ! Always too good to be a side-man in my opinion , he has worked along side the likes of Eric Clapton , George Harrision & Roger Waters playing guitar but his marvellous distinctive voice has gone unheard for too long . This album is a breath of fresh air for those who like me are rather depressed at the lack of real music out there , Every track is strong and you can tell that he has worked very hard on producing such great lyrics . It 's musically sweet alright and deserves to sell by the truck load . So buy it and buy your next door neighour a copy too !
 the msot beautiful song in the world
 I graduated high school in 1989 . When I heard this album I thought I was back cruising in my 79 Cutlass , jamming with the boys . This album is a true throwback in time . It would have been a number one back then and should now . If it does n't get the credit it deserves it shows how screwed up the so called critics are . This is absolutely a totally kick-a ** album from the hard rocking licks to the beautiful ballads . In all my days of rocking this has to rank with the best albums I have ever heard bar none . It is excellent real rock-n-roll from the heart . 10 stars on a five star scale . If you like good ol kick ass rock and heart felt ballads you wo n't be disappointed . Trust me , buy it now . It is positively the best album out in the last 10-15years that I 've been a serious music fan . Keep up the great work Great White . ROCK ON !
 Of all of the great bands that have suffered in the past decade because of being unfairly categorized as `` hair '' bands due to a handful of lousy ripoffs from the late 80 's , perhaps no other band is less deserving of this stigma than Great White . Throughout their career , Great White has consistently created melodic , soulful , blues-based metal . Although many people falsely believe that Great White disappeared after the 1989 smash `` Once Bitten , Twice Shy '' , the reality is that they have continued to write quality music throughout the 90 's . `` Ca n't Get There From Here '' is undoubtedly the best offering since the 1989 `` Twice Shy '' , and arguably the best recording of their career . Songs such as ` Sister Mary ' , ` In The Tradition ' , ` Loveless Age ' , and my personal favorite ` Hey Mister ' , contain just about as much feeling as any other music I have ever heard . Vocalist Jack Russell sings with so much true emotion on this album that you almost wonder if an electronic device such as a CD player is capable of withstanding the pressure . You can literally feel every word that he sings . Meanwhile , guitarist Mark Kendall continues to display his knack for constructing guitar solos that are both powerful and delicate at the same time , a perfect compliment to Russell 's singing . Kendall may possibly be the most underappreciated guitarist in rock , and that is truly unfortunate , as his playing is without a doubt anything but average . However , if the mellower stuff is n't your bread and butter , there are still tracks on this album that are raw and ready to rock . ` Wooden Jesus ' , `` Rollin ' Stoned ' , ` Saint Lorraine ' , and ` Gone to The Dogs ' should satisfy your urge to turn up the volume , while ` Ai n't No Shame ' , ` Silent Night ' , and ` Psychedelic Hurricane ' offer the medium between ballad and rocker . If you are fed up with the disaster that is now called `` rock '' -LRB- as I certainly am -RRB- , you should forget about the ridicule from your friends for buying something from an `` 80 's '' band , and give this album a listen . Believe it or not , there are still bands out there that write music that touches people on different levels , that can be a combination of happiness , sadness , anger , and excitement all at once . This is something that modern hard rock bands are obviously incapable of doing , but with `` Ca n't Get There From Here '' , Great White shows that it can definitely still be done . It just takes a little `` old school '' experience .
 I was sad to hear Great White broke up last year . They have been one of the most underated and best , heavy metal bands since they formed back in ' 78 . I love the classic Great White stuff , so I bought this a couple years ago . They have always been called a `` hair '' band . That is not true in the least . They have always been better then average songsmiths and a talented group . They have always stuck close to their bluesy Zeppelin roots . This album is the best record they ever did in the 23 year history of the band . It is the best hard rock album I have heard in years . This is MUCH better then Aerosmtih 's latest album , `` Just push Play '' . Great White should be one of the biggest classic metal bands , but the stress of being pushed aside for the last decade of the bands history , has finally killed off one of the true greats of hard rock . Damn you , grunge rock . This was not a talentless `` hair '' band , but it 's too late for Great White . This is a classic , spirited hard rock album . Give it the respect it deserves .
 I was a huge fan of this band 's material from their 1986 release `` Shot In The Dark '' right up through 1992 's `` Psycho City '' . Included in this stretch , of course , was the band 's biggest albums -- all of which I loved . Unfortunately , the band released a true dud in 1994 -- the very limp `` Sail Away '' . I never got anything new from them again after that -- until a tip from a friend convinced me to give this album a try.While this certainly is n't as rocking as , say , the classic `` Once Bitten '' album , it still has a lot of great songs . Clearly , the blues/rock style is still there . The leadoff track `` Rollin ' Stoned '' sounds like a vintage Great White rocker . `` Ai n't No Shame '' is a gorgeous melodic anthem , one of my favorite tracks on the album . `` Silent Night '' is a mellow but quality ballad . From there you hear quite a bit of mellow stuff -- but much more memorable and of higher quality than the material of `` Sail Away '' . Also -- there are still some rockers here . One notable track is the second to last one , `` Psychedelic Hurricane '' , which is one of the most unique and interesting tracks the band has ever done.All of the tracks on this album are decent to excellent , and Jack Blades of Night Ranger fame does a fine job in producing the album . If you were a fan of Great White in their prime , I encourage you to give this one a shot . Like me , you just might be surprised with the quality of the material here .
 Great White 's `` Ca n't Get There From Here '' is a solid effort ! I 've got to admire these guys . They kept on cranking out albums all through the nineties , in spite of all the `` alternative '' types of rock bands that had sprung up on the scene . This album is Great White at their `` hard rock with a bluesy flavor '' best . There is nothing experimental about this album . It has the classic Great White sound that the fans love . I think this album proves that this band just keeps getting better with age . If you are already a fan of Great White , you WILL NOT want to miss picking up a copy of this album ! You do n't need to be a Great White fan to appreciate it however ! If you are a fan of melodic hard rock , or `` 80 's metal '' , as some folks insist on calling it , this album would be a great addition to your collection . In fact , if you are a fan of this style of rock , you may be in for a pleasant surprise ! Many of these bands have 1999 and 2000 releases ! After you pick up a copy of `` Ca n't Get There From Here '' you might want to check out some of your other favorite bands in the genre . You may be pleasantly surprised . Need a memory jog ? Click on over to my home page on Amazon . I have most of the bands reviewed or at least mentioned . Are you ready to rock ? : o -RRB-
 Well well well the boys are back with a vengeance . Here is a sure way to listen to this album for the first time . Play `` Gone To The Dogs '' and `` Psychedelic Hurricane '' first . They are 2 good songs on the album . It only gets great after that . From Tales from the road `` Freedom Song '' and `` In The Tradition '' this album is nothing short of awesome . From the bluesy `` Loveless Age '' to the traditional Great White rocker `` Rollin ' Stoned '' this album is without out a doubt the best one made by any group in the 90 's . And to top it off `` Ai n't No Shame '' delivers a phenomenal chorus which is nothing short of sensational . Any collection should not be without this cd .
 I have been a hard rock fan since I listened to GN ` R . They were the start , and after that I started to track down other bands , that for good or bad , were included in the LA Hard Rock 80 's movement -LRB- even GN ' R who obviously , did n't fit in the glam scene -RRB- . I went from Poison to Cinderella -LRB- another band of the pack that was not even from LA -RRB- , Slaughter , M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e , Faster Pussycat , Firehouse , Skid Row , Enuff Z'Nuff , Bang Tango , Pretty Boy Floyd ... you name it ! However , I never listened to Great White until I read a couple of rave reviews of `` Ca n't Get There From Here '' . A few months later I found this CD at a good price and decided I would give it a try . What a discovery ... This CD just rocks !! It has plenty of rockers and also slower numbers that can satisfy all tastes as long as you like to rock and roll . It has blues , it has hard rock , it has american classic rock , it has metal riffs , it has everything ! And on top of everything , it has great songs performed by a solid band . And that , my friends , is what makes this CD timeless . `` Rollin ' Stoned '' is a great opener which you ca n't stop moving your feet to . Pure rock and roll , period . After that , the songs start to flow with no stop until you reach the end . That 's how good this album is . My personal favorites are `` In the Tradition '' -LRB- great , sad ballad with an amazing acoustic guitar sound and Jack Russell 's vocals at its best -RRB- , `` Freedom Song '' -LRB- an instant classic in a better world -RRB- , `` Gone to the Dogs '' -LRB- metal riff-o-rama that kicks you in the teeth -RRB- , `` Silent Night '' or `` Sister Mary '' . Every song on this album has soul . Has something to say.Since then I have checked earlier Great White stuff and I also like it a lot , but nothing compares to this 1999 album . Some might say that I have a conditioned view of Great White because I started with this album and that I am not getting what Great White really is . I could agree , but I 'm fine with that . `` Ca n't Get There From Here '' is simply a great rock and roll record that I will bring with me to my grave -LRB- along with a handful more ! -RRB- .
 I just wanted to say that I bought this album when it was first released And 3 years later i 'm still listening to it . It 's not getting old ! It 's definatly top notch , one of their best . Almost every song rocks . And the ballads are great as well.If you 're a rock fan you wo n't be disapointed with this one .
 Remember the 80 's ? Remember heavy metal ? Well , unfortunately , any band that played rock and roll during that era not only got labled a heavy metal band , even worse , they got labled a `` hair band '' . Long hair and loud guitars got lots of groups noticed at the time just because it was popular , but in todays world of cookie cutter music it is the kiss of death , no matter how good the band is . Well , if there is ANY group from that bygone era that deserves to be listened to still , simply because they are better than most anything you will hear being popularized on the radio today , it is Great White . And with the release of `` Cant Get There From Here '' they show just why . Dismiss Def Leppard if you must , because they stick to formula and release the same album under different names . Dismiss Motley Crue if you must because they cant decide who should be in the band or what they should be doing . DO NOT however dismiss GW , because they are working harder than even James Brown ever thought of and are giving results so good that they not only SHOULD be on every critic and fan list of top 10 releases of 1999 with their new CD , but they absolutely DESERVE to be . From the opening guitar licks of `` Rolling Stoned '' to the very last note of `` Hey Mister '' this is one extraordinary effort . What makes it so special is that it is not a release that tries to capatilize on such popular songs as `` Rock Me '' or the one everybody knows , `` Once Bitten Twice Shy '' . Instead it is a collection of beautifully written , and even better vocalized , songs . You want to have your heart ripped out ? Then just listen to Jack Russell sing `` Ai n't No Shame '' and you can feel the pain come through the man 's voice . How many of today 's singers can make you do that ? Want to have some fun ? Then listen to the opening track , `` Rolling Stoned '' where Jack 's voice and Mark Kendall 's guitar mesh perfectly and cruise down the road with a smile on your face . Almost every song on this CD is a standout and deserves to be heard . The songwriting is just brilliant and the vocals of Mr. Russell have never been better . Some things can not only survive the 80 's , they can also improve . Forget labels , forget what people say about `` hair bands '' , do yourself a favor and buy `` Cant Get There From Here '' because it is kick ass , straight forward rock and roll , and because after so much Matchbox 20 , or Smashmouth , or whatever the flavor of the month happens to be on the radio , you deserve to have some music that actually makes you feel something for a change . The 80 's doesnt have to be a stigma folks , some good music actually survived , and this is the absolute BEST of it . RUN , dont walk , and purchase this CD , you can thank me later after you do .
 I recently had a chance to pick up this album , and it holds up quite nicely after over a decade . While it 's not as classic as Once Bitten or Twice Shy , nor as great as Psycho City , it is a nice collection of blues-tinged rock that Great White excelled at . In many ways , GW was the true successor to Led Zeppelin , only not quite as experimental . They knew how to construct a song and perform it well . It 's a shame that they 'll forever be remembered for the RI club fire , and that they 're now fueding with each other over the name because in their prime , there were few who were as good at what they did . Anyway , if you enjoyed 80 's hard rock , you should check this album out because it would have fit nicely in the mode of Hooked or Twice Shy , with some excellent songs such as Hey Mister , Wooden Jesus , and Sister Mary .
 This Great White album seems to have a mix of the old and the new . there is really no super `` radio ready '' song , but all of the songs are very good . If you liked `` Sail Away '' , `` Hooked '' , and `` Once Bitten '' , you 'll love this one too .
 I love Great White 's music . And their latest C.D. -LRB- Ca n't Get There From Here -RRB- Is a fantastic album . Silent Night , and Hey Mister are my favorits . I listen to all of their music and love it all . Will always continue to look forward to their next C.D. absolutly ! . Keep on rocking guys , cause I certainly will . Sara a great fan from Seattle .
 This new record are a blasting one.wooden jesus and rollin stoned are best tracks with geat lyrics and great voice .
 Seems like a long time ago I slipped my first Great White disc into the player . Once again , as with all previously released discs the same eagerness and emotions were flowing as I struggled to remove the cellophane from the jewel case . Hands sweating , I opened the case turned on the audio system and cranked up the volume without reading the insert . No , I am sick or demented . I am just one of the many loyal fans of the band , since 1986 . I must say that this disc is just what I expected from the band . Excellence ! They have once again exceeded my expectations . I welcome bassist Sean McNabb to the band . I can relate to Rollin ' Stoned and Wooden Jesus . I love the message . As with any Great White disc I was not disappointed with anything . I think it 's great to hear a new Great White track hitting the airwaves ! Hope the suits keep allowing them to be aired after the newness is gone . As always they took thier time and the did very well , always worth the wait . My five year old son loves it too . I hope they continue on so he can enjoy them with his children.WHERE DID ALL THE DAYS GO ?
 So here I was , wanting to buy a good rock cd . Just looking for anything . Then I got to the letter `` G '' , and then I noticed GREAT WHITE . Sure I had some of their stuff and it was pretty good . Never been a big big fan of GW but I respected them as a good straight foward rock n roll band . I picked up a copy of `` Ca n't get there from here '' , just as a shot in the dark . I hit the damn target here . This album has truly opened my eyes . From `` Rollin ' Stoned '' to `` Hey Mister '' , this album rocks . Highlights , to me , are `` In the Tradition '' -LRB- beautiful song -RRB- and `` Wooden Jesus '' GREAT WHITE will always hold a spot in my cd player . Keep Rockin ' !!!!
 GREAT WHITE IS BACK WITH VENGENCE . THIS ALBUM IS THE BEST THEY HAVE EVER DONE . I PUT THIS CD IN FOR THE FIRST TIME AND I CANT STOP LISTENING TO IT !! IT JUST TO GOOD ... JOHN KALODNER HAS GOT TO PROMOTE THIS CD IT IS A WINNER . MY 13 YEAR DAUGHTER WHO LIKES NEWER MUSIC LIKE ALICE IN CHAINS . WANTS TO PLAY THIS CD ALL THE TIME HER AND HER FRIENDS LOVE IT .
 Rollin Stones is just the beginning of some of the best guaritar chords ever heard . This band captures a wide band of listeners - baby boomers to the X-generation . It 's raw , comtempary , and the rythem hooks you instantly . Take it from me - I 've listened to all of them -LRB- since 1956 -RRB- - this CD is definitely worth it - you will play it until it `` skips '' .
 I have been a GW fan forever ! I have a hard time waiting for each new release , but when it arrives , I always get my $ $ worth . No doubt the most hard working , talented band EVER ! Their dedication to their fans far exceeds that of ANY other band . I will ALWAYS be a GW fan !
 I have n't bought the CD , I only heard the song on the radio , and it 's about time some group came up with something besides the trendy junk that continually flies thru our airwaves day in and day out . Keep it comin guys , I 'll buy the CD without hesitation !
 THIS ALBUM IS THE BEST . IT 'S GOOD FOR ANYONE -LRB- i 'm 12 -RRB- . TELL YOUR FRIENDS , TELL YOUR ENEMIES .
 This CD has a little bit of everything . You like fast-paced rockers ? Got it . You like blues ? Got it . You like mid-tempo rockers ? Got it . You like ballads ? Got it . You like a great blend of song-writing and musicianship ? Definitely got it . This album is many things , but most of all it 's just a solid rock and roll album and a showcase for Jack Russell 's tremendous voice .
 Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water . This is Great White at there best.From rockin songs like Rolling Stoned and Gone to the Dogs to ballads like Silent Night and Sister Mary.It has something for everyone.This is a must.If you have n't yet BUY IT NOW .
 What more can i say about this amazing album ? From the first chord of `` Rollin ' Stoned '' to the impressive `` Hey Mister '' , it 's Great White at their best . Jack Russel proves one more time that he is one of the greatest vocalist ever , and Mark Kendall 's guitar playing is simply brilliant . The album is full of great songs with fine lyrics
 The album contains good ballads , rocking tunes , and introspective songs , not what you expect from a `` typical ' 80 's metal '' band .
 I bought the new album about two weeks ago , and it 's the only album I 've had in my cd-player since then . As always a good mixture of rockers and ballads ; bringing in Jack Blades was a great move ! Already looking forward to the next album !
 I HAVE BEEN PLAYING THE CD REGULARLY , WHILE AT MY COMPUTER AND ON THE STEREO . . I LOVE THE MUSIC . . AI N'T NO SHAME , ROLLING STONED , WOODEN JESUS -LRB- KEEP THE FAITH -RRB- ... A GREAT ALBUM FROM THE HARDEST LONGTIME WORKING BAND IN THE INDUSTRY , AND GOOD PEOPLE TOO ! EXCELLENT MUSIC .
 Great White are back and in Majestic form with beer drinking music at its best . C'mon America buy this album and send it to number 1 where it belongs . Every song stands on its own with no flaws at all . They are all classics if you do n't beleive me then buy it and find out for yourselves . Stand out song is the early seventies throw back Wooden Jesus , totally superb . For a man like me with over 1000 cds in his collection this ranks in the top 3 easily . Mark Kendall is axeman extrodinaire and Jack Russell is his usual excellent self . Buy this and put the Great back into Great White . Peace Adi
 `` Ca n't Get Their From Here '' Is a rock album that is bluesy and is geared toward the people that grew up in the 80 's . I feel you have to live a little bit to really grasp the meaning of these songs . A person has to have been in love at one time and also loose a love to understand the true meaning of these songs . Silent Night and Loveless Age are about lose of love and society 's view on love in this day in age . Gone To the Dogs is a song about over indulgence of drugs and alchol . I really apreciate this ablum and the meaning of the lyrics . It may be hard for teens to get a true feeling for the music .
 This latest cd is very good . About the only negative thing that I can find to say about it is that it should have had a few less ballads & more kick ass songs on it like Rollin ' Stoned . But all in all a good cd .
 I 'm not sure what their inspiration was for this album but this is one of the best albums to come out in a long time . Jack Russell 's voice sounds better than ever and the lyrics and melodies are superb . This album may never receive the critical acclaim that it truely deserves but nevertheless my thanks to Great White for a highly enjoyable album ! Hope to see you on tour ... SOON !
 I recently came up with my own list of what I believe are to be the greatest 100 albums in rock history . This one is probably around 101 . When I bought this upon it 's release in 1999 , I could n't stop listening to it . Rollin ' Stoned was a great pick me up tune and the rest of the record just seemed to flow so well together . 2006 ... It is so hard to write a review of this album . It has great songs , great writing , great singing and great musicianship . I think what I miss on this record that always seems to be a big part of every Great White CD is that big song with the over the top bass line . -LRB- Mista Bone on Twice Shy , Hand on the Trigger on Let it Rock or Lady Red Light on Once Bitten -RRB- Gone to the dogs could have been that song here , but the band di n't pull that off . Silent Night seems like a classic that has poor lyrics.I would have loved to included this in my top 100 albums of all time , but the few flaw that i brought up made me place it just below that . Now this is a must have for any fan of Great White , but for starters I 'd go with Twice Shy , Hooked or Let it Rock
 THIS IS THE BEST CD BY GREAT WHITE.I HAVE ALL OFF THERE CDS AND ON THIS ONE THEY ARE MORE POLISHED THEN ANY OF THERE OTHER CDS.I HAVE SEEN THESE GUY 2 TIMES IN CONCERT AND I CAN TELL YOU THEY ROCK.IT ` S JUST TO BAD THAT THERE GUITAR PLAYER MARK KENDALL LEFT THE BAND AFTER THIS CD.HE WILL BE HARD TO REPLACE.IF YOU ARE NEW TO GREAT WHITE , THIS CD IS A GREAT PLACE TO START .
 Though Great White have never released a bad album , this one is an one of their best ones . All songs are very melodic . I love all the ballads in this CD . Although I am a big fan of Thrash metal -LRB- Anthrax , Metallica , Pantera 's kind of music -RRB- , I like this CD very much because of Great White 's acoustic guitar sounds and Jack 's voice . Buy it ! You will never regret .
 I am 32 years old and have listened to rock music all my life . This is truly a masterpiece of American Rock . These guys really deserve more credit than they are typically given . The album is more mature than any of their earlier albums but it is CLASSIC Great White from start to finish . You wo n't find Great White selling out to the `` let 's try to sound like what 's popular now '' scene . They are , have been , and always will be true to good old fashion American blues hard rock . GO BUY THIS ALBUM !! It is a real classic . And if you have n't picked up Great White 's tribute to Led Zeppelin yet ... Oh my word ... you will not believe ... You have to hear it to believe it ! Wow !
 This Album is a great testimonial to the overall talent , style , and magic that GREAT WHITE brought to rock music fans all over the world . The songs are mature and well written , both musically and lyrically . I do n't understand why this excellent album did not receive more support and publicity from the music industry , and from the so-called Rock Radio stations around the world . This is music that will reach into your mind , heart , and soul . I strongly encourage all Great White Fans to purchase this Album , and listen to it with an open mind . As for GREAT WHITE Band Members , I think you should restart the band with the same players that appeared on the `` HOOKED '' Album . I know that the Rhode Island incident will always haunt you , and cause a lot of self-doubt , but real fans of Rock & Roll music would really like to have you guys back with a new Album ! Nobody in their `` right mind '' really blames the band members for what happened on that ill-fated night . I know that I would eagerly show up for any future `` reunion '' show that features the band 's original players . So when-ever you can `` face the day '' of playing the music that only GREAT WHITE can deliver , all of your fans will be waiting ! Good luck to the band members and all of their family and friends ! We who love you will never forget you ! If Tony Montana -LRB- Bass -RRB- and Mark Kendal -LRB- guitar -RRB- read this -- `` you can come back baby , 'cause Rock & Roll never forgets '' !!!
 as usual the great white crew puts out another good one . Any true fan will love it and play it often .
 Every single song on this disc could be a radio hit . Ever since I got this album I ca n't stop listening to it , and when I 'm not listening to it , I hear the songs in my head . It is the best album of 1999 .
 What an incredible CD . First time through it I loved it . But as I listen to it more and more I feel that its probably their best Album yet . In my opinion this band is one of the best they have been around for awhile and continue on putting out great albums . Their style is just to sweet . Lets hope they keep the great albums coming . This CD offers their hard rocking style as well as their softer ballads .
 HEY WELL HARD ROCKS # 1 GROUP IS BACK AND BETTER THAN THEY HAVE IN YEARS EVEN THO THE LAST BUNCH HAVE BEEN 5 STAR CDS ALSO THIS ONE IS THE CD SINCE TWICESHY IT ROCKS AND SOME OF THEIR BEST BALLADS PICK IT UP ITS THE BEST CD OF 99 SO FAR
 Short and simple
 Best album of there 's since `` Once Bitten '' . Jack Russel 's voice sounds better than it ever has . Maybe this album will help bring them back in the spotlight .
 Being a very , very picky fan , I was skeptical at the thought of GW being back on a Major label -LRB- see sellout ! -RRB- but , ... boy was I surprised ! This album rocks !! Not only is every song great , it really sounds as though they 've grown and matured in their songwriting . Blades and Dokken 's influence is really refreshing . Ultimately , though , GW is still GW , which is what we want.Best possiblities for singles would be `` Silent Night '' , `` In the Tradition '' and `` Wooden Jesus '' . -LRB- Hello , John Kalodner , you listening ?? ;--RRB- -RRB- Ca n't wait to see them live !!
 Great White are back in a big way . This CD rocks . The 1980s are back and its time to put alternative music back into the grave . Great CD with blistering rockers and great musicianship and song writing . Ca n't wait to see them on tour with Ratt . As good as `` Once Bitten '' or `` Twice Shy . ''
 great white is 15 years older and better with their new release `` ca n't get there from here '' . every song is great in it 's own way and jack russell is writing most of the songs . might i say hey is an awesome songwriter . buy this cd now !
 This album smokes from start to finish !! The first single is killer `` Rollin ' Stoned !! '' This could be one of Great White 's best performances in years . Rock on guys !!
 If you love 80 's Rock N ' Roll you will love this CD . This is their best recording to date ... mixing in all their different `` Styles '' . They have taken the best of `` Sail Away '' and `` Psycho City '' and went recorded one damn fine album . I found myself singing alone with the choruses on the first listen . Only one song seems a little out of place ... `` Gone To The Dogs '' . Perhaps too much of Don Dokken 's talents crept in to this one for a Great White disc . Buy this CD and ROCK !
 I have been a Great White fan since their self titled first album ... in fact , I went to see Judas Priest back in '84 only because Great White was the opening act.I still love listening to the old stuff , but this one is by far my favorite . It is definitely more mature and mellow by comparison ... but I keep listening to this one over and over ! `` Rolling Stoned '' is good , classic rock 'n' roll , and the ballads are fabulous!The boys get some help from a couple of my other favorite rockers ... Jack Blades -LRB- Night Ranger , Damn Yankees , Shaw/Blades -RRB- helped to write quite a few songs . You can really hear his influence on `` In the Tradition '' ... which has to be the best song on the album . Don Dokken -LRB- Dokken -RRB- helped out on `` Wooden Jesus '' . So , whether you are a `` old '' die-hard fan , or a new one , do n't miss this one !
 Have this album , and it should have been nominated -LRB- even won -RRB- for a Grammy when it was released , but they were competing against UGH ! rap music -LRB- if that is what you want to call it -RRB- . Great White really does care about their fans . Being located in the middle of the Indian Ocean , we do n't get to hear the `` home '' bands as often as everyone else . They came down to Diego Garcia and `` Rocked Me '' and the rest of us and it was a packed club both nights -LRB- during the work week -RRB- ! Have been a fan and always will be . Thanks Great White for bringing a little bit of home to the island .
 Rarely has an 80 's metal band been able to put out a CD that has come close to or matched their albums of the 80 's . This is one of those rare CD 's . It is an absolute must have for anyone who likes Great White or anyone who enjoys a bluesy type of rock 'n roll/heavy metal . What makes this album so much better than most matal releases of the late 90 's and even alot of those actually released during the 80 's , is that there are no throw aways and it stirs up emotion and passion . Every song from beginning to end is top quality . A few of my favorites on the hard rocking bluesy side are Wooden Jesus and Rollin Stoned and for the slower rock ballads In the Tradiiton and Silent Night are very solid .
 This album , and much of the band 's other recent output , has gotten a little bit of flak for being too soft and too bluesy but you got to admit it sounds GREAT ! The sound is n't that much different , just a bit mellower . However , the big thing is the HUGE improvement in songwriting . This is Great White 's best songwriting yet . The earlier stuff rocked , do n't get me wrong , but some of the lyrics left a bit to be desired . `` Hey Mister '' is about poverty , `` Rolling Stoned '' is about the older days when the band was huge , `` Ai n't no shame '' is filled with emotion , `` Psychedelic Hurricane '' has a great vibe to it and Great White should go in that direction a little more often . It has a new sound but still sounds like classic Great White . `` Silent night '' and `` Sister Mary '' are a bit softer . The band really dives head on into the bluesy sound with `` Loveless Age '' one of the album 's highlights . The playing is great and this album got a lot of deserved airplay on some rock radio stations . `` In the tradition '' is a Bob-Dylanesque piece that runs a little short . To sum it up , the boys have put out another great album and it sounds like a cross between `` Twice shy '' and `` Sail away '' . Jack Blades -LRB- Night Ranger -RRB- and Don Dokken -LRB- Dokken -RRB- both helped to shape this album into what it is . All Great White fans , please apply !
 While having considered myself just an average Great White fan , I think they have , with Ca n't Get There From Here , far surpassed anything they have done in the past , even counting Once Bitten ... All the songs ROCK , no filler here -LRB- unlike the Hooked or Psycho City albums -RRB- . From the opening hit `` Rollin ' Stoned '' , the Tesla-like `` Ai n't No Shame '' , to the gorgeous ballads `` Silent Night '' -LRB- no , not the Xmas or Bon Jovi song ! -RRB- and `` In the Tradition '' -LRB- my personal favorite -RRB- , every song 's a keeper . `` Saint Lorraine '' and `` Freedom Song '' remind you of the Great White of old , while `` Loveless Age '' and `` Wooden Jesus ' are two of their bluesier numbers . `` Psychedelic Hurricane '' and `` Gone to the Dogs '' rock harder than we 've heard these guys rock for a long while . Let 's hope we get a few more albums like this out of these guys before they hang up their guitar straps !
 While I like almost all kinds of music , my heart still belongs to Hard and Heavy Rock and Roll , and this CD is one of the best I 've heard in a LONG time ! Great White has always been one of my fave bands ever since I first heard `` Once Bitten '' , way back when I was a senior in high school . They have continually improved in their music styling over the years and it is WAY evident in `` Ca n't Get There From Here '' . Simply put , THIS ONE IS THE BEST !
 Great White offers up a great album here while maintaining their blues/rock sound that we have grown used to over the years . I do n't think most bands could have lasted as long as GW using the same formula for this long . The key to their success I believe is in the song writing itself . When I first heard this CD , -LRB- there was quite a few distractions -RRB- , it did n't impress me too much . When I listened to it the second time without the distractions , I thought it was very well written and could stand up on its own . Bottom line is Great White puts out music that is heads above most of the garbage you 'll hear on the radio and they deserve credit fot it . Give it a try !
 If you loved the Once Bitten and Twice Shy albums , you will love this one . If you really digged Psycho City , you will also dig this . And if Let It Rock was your favorite , then this album will take its place . What I 'm trying to say is that Ca n't Get There features songs that could have easily been off of their other releases
 These guys know how to make great rock , plain and simple . Jack Russell is by far the best rock singer of his generation , and he proves it on this cd . It 's great to hear them still at the top of their game after so many years of ups and downs . Just a great CD . When will Great White get the credit they deserve for being as good as they are ?
 Very enjoyable new release by Great White . Their live show was also very good - great sound and stage presence . Could have played one more new song though .
 When 20th century operatic history is written , there will be certain interpretations that writers will say stood out and must be counted as the greatest of their time
 Being a great fan of Beverly Sills , I have listened to all of her recordings . She was a brilliant Violetta -LRB- Traviata -RRB- and a powerful Lucia , but the role of Queen Elizabeth I in Donizetti 's ROBERTO DEVEREUX was , in my opinion , her greatest achievement . This live video performance is gripping . Her singing is superb and her acting is inspired . She IS Elizabeth , in all of her glory and her despair . Many have compared her performance to that of the great Bette Davis as Queen Elizabeth and I would agree with that judgement . This is the paramount performance of Sills ' illustrious career .
 Beverly Sills is great in this DVD . Her fiery , nuanced , totally believable performance of Queen Elizabeth makes up for her out-of-prime singing . She is incredible . She conveys stage magic to the audience . Her movements are perfectly calculated , but seem completely spontaneous on stage . Sills is truly a national treasure . This role is very difficult , but Sills pushes her voice bravely to meet its insane demands . Yes , her lower register is very weak , but she is very adept at using it effectively .
 This DVD , also available on VHS , was filmed in 1975 at the Wolf Trap Festival . Stars the incredible soprano Beverly Sills in the role of Queen Elizabeth I of England , tenor John Alexander as the title hero Roberto Devereux and bass baritone Richard Fredericks as the villainous Duke of Nottingham . The opera is a collector 's treasure of opera and a must have for fans of the diva Beverly Sills . It is undoubtedly her greatest performance . She began to sing the role in 1969 and took the world by storm through the early 70 's , impressive not only for her ability to sing so demanding a vocal role , but also singing all three Tudor Queen operas of Donizetti - Anna Bolena and Maria Stuarda were the other two that preceed Roberto Devereux . In the mid 70 's , the medium of television and film was beginning to reach the opera crowds . Joan Sutherland did it in the 80 's and opera films such as the 1979 Don Giovanni starring Kiri Te Kenawa and Raigero Raimondi was becoming popular . Beverly 's other opera films , taped performances for the Wolf Trap and for the New York City Opera include Jules Massenet 's Manon , which is possibly her second best performance next to this . Also available is Donizetti 's Daughter Of The Regiment sung in English , Rossini 's Barber Of Seville and Verdi 's La Traviata . All worth the purchase.The part of Queen Elizabeth in this opera is as vocally difficult to sing as Norma of Bellini 's opera . Although the part calls for a dramatic , big voice , Sills proved to the world that a light instrument can be trained to dramatic heights . She is on fire as the Queen , all passion , from love in the aria `` L'amor suo '' to coloratura spectacular in `` A Ritorno Qual Ti Spera '' . In Act 2 , her soft romantic side fades as she discovers that Roberto Devereux , the object of her affection , loves another woman , Duchess Sara -LRB- sung by the mezzo soprano Susan Marsee in a superb performance -RRB- . The Duke of Nottingham , previously a friend and loyal supporter of Robert Devereux , become jealous also when he learns of his romantic link with Sara , his arranged wife . He , together with the Queen and the entire court , conclude Act 2 with a fiery ensemble `` Va La Morte '' that totally brings the house down . Beverly Sills is at her strongest in this dramatic act , as she rages in majestic fury and orders his death sentence . In the last part , she regrets her rash decision and attempts to save him , but it 's too late . Devereux is executed and Queen Elizabeth begins to die that very day , as she mourns and laments with bitterness the final arias.This is Beverly Sills at the height of her career . She earned a cover in Time magazine for this performance . She looks back and remembers the Golden Age that this was for singers like her . Currently , recordings of Beverly Sills which have long been LP albums are finally making it into the compact disc market . Available now are `` Beverly Sills The Great Recordings '' , `` The Art Of Beverly Sills '' `` Plaisir D'Amour '' `` Sillsiana '' `` Lucia Di Lammermoor '' `` La Traviata '' `` Manon '' `` Tales Of Hoffman '' `` Barber Of Seville '' `` Rigoletto '' `` L'Assedio Di Corinto '' `` Ballad Of Baby Doe '' `` La Fille Du Regiment '' and the opera in which she sang Cleopatra which launched her career in ' 64-65 Handel 's Julius Caesar . Check them out . You will fall for the voice of Beverly Sills .
 If I were forced to choose only ONE of my opera-DVD and Video-collection I 's choose this one without another thought . I 'm a history-buff and knowing the story of Elizabeth I. pretty well let me tell you that Sill 's presence equals that of the divine Glenda Jackson , the actress who played Elizabeth I. in BBC 's highly acclaimed mini-series `` Elizabeth R. '' -LRB- R. stands for Regina -RRB- !!!! Add to this a woman who 's BURNING up the stage with her thrilling voice ! Beverly once said that this Elisabetta cut off at least 5 years of her career . But WHAT a performance this is !!! Beats Edita Gruberova EASILY . If you love opera and great singing RUN to buy this and be drawn into history !
 In 1975 , about four or five years after Beverly Sills first performed the feisty Queen Elizabeth in New York City 's Opera , she once again dazzled audiences at the Wolf Trap Festival . Performing with her that night was John Alexander in the tenor role of Robert Devereux , Susan Marsee in the mezzo-dramatic role of the Duchess Sara and Richard Fredricks in the baritone role of Nottingham . Julius Rudel conducts . He is an esteemed and long-time conductor , who has worked with Beverly Sills before in such operas as Anna Bolena , Manon and La Traviata . Julius Rudel has excellent power as a conductor , with thoughtful precision and dynamics that fuel the orchestra to dramatic heights . From 1969-1975 Beverly Sills was busy expanding her originally light lyric repertoire to the dramatic intensity of such operas as Roberto Devereux , Lucrezia Borgia ands Bellini 's Norma . Many opera critics note how Beverly 's transformation from light `` head '' voice to the heavy `` chest voice '' cost her career to be shortened . But Beverly has herself admitted that it was worth it . And this Roberto Devereux performance proves that it was indeed worth it.Susan Marsee has worked with Beverly Sills before . There are studio recordings of Offenbach 's Tales Of Hoffman , one of Beverly 's favorite operas , in which Susan Marsee sings the role of Nicklause and the Muse . Susan Marsee is primarily a mezzo soprano but shows signs of soprano lyricism . As the Duchess Sara , the secret rival to Queen Elizabeth - they are both in love with the same man Roberto Devereux , Susan Marsee potrays an anguished and long suffering Elizabethan lady of the court . She has been married out of sheer convenience to Nottingham and her love for Devereux we assume has never been consumated . Susan Marsee 's first aria , sung in unison with the chorus of ladies of the court is heavy with sorrow and suffering.Beverly 's first aria , the Queen 's `` L'amor suo me fe beata '' follows the same kind of tender romance , as the Queen is hopeful that Devereux loves her . She is a lot more festive in spirit in the coloratura showcase `` A ritorno qual ti spera '' . When Devereux first makes his apperance , John Alexander kneels before the Queen who makes it quite clear she loves him . Note the slow string section which plays , further enhanced in their duet `` Un tenero core '' . Their relationship , nonetheless , is a rocky one , for the Queen suspects Devereux loves another woman . Although she point-blank asks him if he loves another , he lies to her by saying he does not . The intensity of the fast-paced duet `` Un lampo orribile '' is very indicative of the tense , dramatic chemistry between Queen Elizabeth and Devereux , which is the real fire in the opera.I feel sadly that John Alexander is not suited in this performance for the role of Devereux . Originally , Placido Domingo sang the role . He created a standard that most tenors tackle . Domingo has the perfect romantic heroism and the voice . Not that John Alexander does not have `` the voice '' for Devereux but he simply puts little effort into his performance and his effiminate , Cowardly Lion looks make him inappropriate as Roberto Devereux , who should come off as very masculine but tormented and torn between duty and love . Also the prison scene is very generic and unsatisfying . Baritone Richard Fredricks is also very wooden in this performance and does not provide much of the drama . He is supposed to play a villain . He betrays his best friend Devereux and practically carries out the execution himself once he discovers it is Devereux whom his wife Sara truly loves.The reason for getting this is Beverly Sill 's powerful performance as Queen Elizabeth . In white make-up , heavy Elizabethan regial wardrobe , imperious poses and in her dramatic soprano voice , Beverly became the real Queen Elizabeth in what could pass for an Oscar winning opera performance . She landed a cover in Time magazine in November of 1971 . From her facial contortions , raging screams -LRB- mostly expressing her fury in Act 2 -RRB- , pointig her finger in accusation at Devereux , slapping Devereux and her grief and torture after learning he has been executed in the final act -LRB- at one point even pushing Nottingham after learning that he is most responsible for Devereux ' death `` Spietato Cor ! '' `` Heartless man ! '' -RRB- . This is Beverly Sills at her best , surpassing all the sopranos who have dared to take on the role of the commanding Queen Elizabeth - Leyla Gencer who started the tradition back in World War II days , Montserrat Caballe who sang the Queen in the 60 's and Edita Gruberova in the 80 's . Even today 's sopranos who take up the challenge of performing as the Queen fail to deliver the same power and majesty with which Beverly Sills infused her unrivaled performance .
 I certainly agree with other customers that this was a great performance by Sills and I enjoyed the supporting cast as well ! The makeup and costumes were unbelievable !! I purchased VHS , found picture and sound excellent . Having a large LD collection ; not anxious to invest in DVD just yet . Certainly recommend this to anyone as a good buy - especially if you also like her `` 3 Queens '' CD set . Only just received and watched once but intend to watch it many more times and look forward to sharing it with my opera friends . Gave it 4 stars only in comparison to other operas that I prefer . The quality of the singing , production and recording are just fine ! A wonderful remembrance of a truly favorite soprano !! I sometimes forget how really great she was ! This video will remind you that she was special and an outstanding singing actress !
 Beverley Sills would have to be one of the greatest singer/actresses to come out of America in all time . The power and range of voice coupled with her commanding stage presence leaves one spell bound . Having seen her live on stage in San Francisco as Massenet 's `` Thas , '' in 1976 , just one year after this present recording , however , both rolls quite different as chalk and cheese , the flirtatious character of the courtesan Thas to the powerful dramatic roll of Queen Elizabeth I , Queen of England ; shows us just how great a performer Miss Sills is . Her supporting cast is equally capable of keeping up with her . Susan Marsee as Sara is both striking and in total control of her character and voice -LRB- even if the cover shows Richard Fredricks in the roll . I think he had better stick to his original roll as Nottingham , Sara 's husband -RRB- . Once again I must mention that John Alexander in the title roll of Roberto Devereux , has not been a voice that I admired . I felt it far too thin and his high notes rather strained , but matched against Miss Sills he manages to stand his ground and give a commanding performance . The Duet Roberto has with Sara in Act I , scene 2 `` Tutto &egrave; silenzio ... Dacch&egrave; tornasti , ahi misera ! ... Ah ! quest ` addio fatale '' is beautifully sung and one of my favourite pieces from the opera.Richard Fredricks as Nottingham , Sara 's husband has a powerful voice and stage presence he brings to his character . The rest of the cast are adequate and make this a memorable performance . My only real criticism of the production is that a couple of times the characters go off mike and there was a loss of volume and clarity of voice , but apart from that , this is an opera well worth adding to your collection apart from it 's historical state but to see one of America 's greatest opera stars at work .
 This superb DVD of a live opera performance from New York City is not just specialized only for fans of opera and soprano Beverly Sills -LRB- who achieved her greatest success with the role of Queen Elizabeth I , picture in Time Magazine 1971 -RRB- , but for fans of quality drama on DVD . Opera has been downplayed in recent years . The younger generations of the 90 's are not acquainted with the magic sound world of opera . It is foreign to them , it is intimidating and the myth and stereotype that opera is elitist and boring prevails . My mission , through a precise and detailed review of this particular opera on DVD , is to share my passion as a vocal coach and music teacher for the noble human art of opera and to get a lot of people into opera who would otherwise turn it aside.Beverly Sills , the American opera star who was born in Brooklyn and works exclusively in her hometown as chairman of the Met , reached the peak of her career in her portrayal as Queen Elizabeth I , in the otherwise obscure Donizetti opera , Roberto Deveraux . The bel canto opera had powerful drama lurking beneath the text in the libretto . Like so many other bel canto operas , including Donizetti 's Lucia Di Lammermoor , it was considered romantic tragedy , fluff , a showcase for dramatic/coloratura soprano with no meaning or substance . But the revivals of Donizetti operas by the singers Maria Callas , Joan Sutherland and Montserrat Caballe -LRB- who effectively portrayed Lucrezia Borgia -RRB- , the otherwise neglected operas were rarely performed . Beverly Sills , in my personal opinion , despite the criticism of being simply a lyric coloratura soprano with signs of weakening vocal stamina in dramatic roles , was a varied , artistic , gifted singer and actress . It was her combination of beautiful singing and effective acting that made her the equal to Maria Callas -LRB- I do not treat Maria Callas religiously and only favor some of her performances -RRB- . Beverly Sills ' dramatic portrayal in Roberto Deveraux can be likened to a Shakesperean heroine . She is regial , overbearing , imperious , romantic , jealous , remorseful , melancholic , in that order . The story is quite well known . It was said that Queen Elizabeth loved Robert Deveraux , Earl of Essex , her naval commander and favorite lord of the court . But after his military involvement in Ireland , he returned with accusations of treason against the Queen . In the Donizetti opera , the personal romantic triangle is the true reason , and his execution is spurred on by the Queen 's jealousy . The Queen loves Roberto deeply , to distraction , one recalls the 30 's Bette Davis film performance in The Private Lives Of Elizabeth and Essex . The Queen might have given him the throne had he not infuriated her . Her love is demonstrated in the lyricism of the aria `` Un tenero core '' and in the coloratura techniques of her aria `` A ritorno qual ti spera '' , as well as her duet with Roberto , `` Un lampo , un lampo orribili '' . Deveraux does not return the Queen 's love , and is instead hopeful he will consumate his love to the Duchess Sara . Act I introduces the love triangle and the romantic side of the Queen . Beverly Sills fires up the audience with her powerful presence - her white-roughed face , her tall and regial character , showcased in her costume , an Elizabethan royal gown that weighed quite a lot , and the slightest movements of her imperious hands.A direct contrast of the Queen 's soft side comes in Act 2 . Once hearing Deveraux has betrayed her , it becomes not merely a political thing , but a personal one . Deveraux has lied to her and loves another woman . `` Un perfido ! Un vile ! Un mentitore ! '' she rages , in scales that resemble Bellini 's Norma , also jilted by the man she loved
 Beverly Sills is the queen of opera . There is no other soprano in the twentieth century other than Maria Callas who could master a variety of roles with vocal beauty and great dramatic performance . Her career was short lived , after singing operetta and a utility singer in her home town of New York she had two children with impediments that she raised and later a cancer operation . She had enormous versatility on the stage ; singing first Cleopatra in Handel 's Julius Caesar , Violetta from La Traviata a reported 54 times , Manon , the three heroines from Offenbach 's Tales of Hoffman , the three Donizetti Queens including Anna Bolena and Maria Stuarda , Lucia Di Lammermoor , Norma and several others . If you are familiar with the three reissued recordings of the Tudor Queens trilogy by Donizetti , you are also aware that Sill 's performance as Queen Elizabeth was her crowning achievement . This DVD is a jewel to watch and a pleasure to hear . Opera lovers and fans of Beverly Sills will enjoy as we watch her fiery performance . Queen Elizabeth becomes jealous when Deveraux , the man she loves and her naval commander , takes an interest in another lady of her court . She orders his execution on grounds of treason but only we know her decision was far more personal . This performance earned Beverly Sills a cover on Time magazine , she was hailed worldwide for her vocal mastership and she is still loved and talked about even to this day . Presently she is the chairman at the Met in New York and has discovered many great opera singers performing in our time . See for yourself the great passion that Donizetti was full of when he composed this magnificent opera . Five Stars . Long live the Queen of Opera !
 Simply said , Beverly Sills revived this opera which , until she made it into her signature role , had not been sung in NYC for 125 years . This DVD documents not only her amazing voice , but her peerless skills as a true singing actress . I am so glad , and saddened at the same time , that it also stands as a testament to the glory of what was New York City Opera , and that it preserves performances by in-house stars such as John Alexander , Susanne Marsee and Richard Fredricks , along with Julius Rudel 's masterful conducting . I was privileged to see the entire `` Queens trilogy '' several times , and I am sorry there is no filmed record of Sills ' `` Maria Stuarda '' -LRB- which I own with Dame Janet Baker -RRB- or `` Anna Bolena '' -LRB- Nebretko is fine in the role -RRB- . I am proud to own this DVD , and I know you will too .
 It was 1969 when Beverly Sills first astounded the world in her incredible performance as Queen Elizabeth in Donizetti 's `` Roberto Devereux '' . A sold-out audience at the New York City Opera witnessed the one time light opera singer transform herself into England 's fiery Queen Elizabeth . Performing Devereux that night was Placido Domingo . In the November 22 1971 issue of Time magazine , she made the cover and the issue featured a full-length article about `` America 's Queen Of Opera '' . That was Beverly Sills at the height of her career and the role of Queen Elizabeth was her crowning achievement.She continued to sing the Queen throughout the early 1970 's as well as the other Donizetti Tudor Queen operas - Maria Stuarda -LRB- Mary Stewart -RRB- and Anna Bolena -LRB- Anne Boleyn -RRB- . These performances were made for studio recordings and have been reissued on cd from their original LP 's available now at Amazon.com . The recordings are amazing and Beverly 's Queen Elizabeth is in much better vocal shape since it was a 1969 - 1970 recording . About five years later , Beverly Sills once again took the throne as Queen Elizabeth when she sang Devereaux one last time for the Wolf Trap Festival filmed and live performance that is on DVD and also on video . As is to be expected of any singer past their prime , Beverly does not sing with the dynamic power she first had in '69 or ' 70 . Nevertheless , she took care of her vocal instrument well enough to sing the Queen one last time in ' 75 . She is seen here in full glory - acting and singing in a very blissful combination as true dramatic opera . From the moment she makes her entrance to her court and greets the long suffering Duchess Sara -LRB- Susan Marsee in a lovely performance -RRB- we get to behold the same powerful drama that the first audiences saw back at the New York City Opera at the start of the 70 's . Dramatic tenor John Alexander sings the title role of Roberto Devereux and pulls through well in the role , though he can never live up to the standard of Placido Domingo . The real `` meat '' of this opera is the intense relationship between Roberto and the Queen . Roberto 's heart belongs to Sara whom he never had the chance to marry . Sara is married to Nottingham -LRB- baritone Richard Fredericks -RRB- a court marriage arranged by the Queen herself . The Queen is clearly in love with Roberto but frustrated that she can never have him . Pure drama and raw emotions abound in most of her showcase arias - Act 1 's tender `` L'amor suo mi fe beata '' , `` A ritorno qual ti spera '' which sparkles with dazzling coloratura and her duets with Devereux `` Un tenero core '' and the fiery `` Un lampo orribile '' . Act 2 ought to be hailed as opera 's greatest single act . Devereux has been trialed in court and is sentenced to death on the Queen 's orders . Beverly 's chest voice , which she pushes down and sudden screams are used to provide the effect of raging fury as Elizabeth discovers that Devereux does not love her and she has an unamed rival . When Nottingham discovers that it 's Sara whom Devereux loves , he has a change of heart and turns on his friend . He now loathes Devereux and favors his execution . The most powerful moment is toward the end of the act . Be strikes a majestic pose , holding the scepter and the royal orb and orders Devereux 's execution . `` Va La Morte Sul Capo Ti Pende '' ensemble ensues with each character expressing their emotions.The final act has the Queen 's heart-felt arias `` Vivi Ingrato '' and `` Quel Sangre Versato '' in which the Queen laments and mourns for Devereux . The rousing finale is treated with applause and an immediate curtain call follows . Julius Rudel , who has conducted for Beverly 's operas before conducts this opera with real passion , pace and elaborate skill , the orchestra playing with superb string articulation . There is no question about it . This is the must have opera for all opera lovers . It 's a treasure worth owning . The majesty and tragedy of Roberto Devereux can be yours to watch time and again and the greatest singing-actress of our time Beverly Sills can appear on your DVD with real strength .
 Overview
 A fine musician friend asked me about opera singers and aging voices and I said the voice is just part of it . I told her for example I have several Devereux videos with singers much better than Sills at this point in her career and yet hers is my favorite . Yes , she 's screechy and wobbly on higher notes , singing inconsistently ... but her characterization is sooooooo intense the well sung ones -LRB- Caballe , Nicolescu -RRB- are tepid by comparison . Alexander needed to be younger vocally . He was quite good much earlier but is just OK here . Fredericks takes the vocal honors singing magnificantly . Just his singing is worth the whole video .
 Roberto Deveraux presents England 's Queen Elizabeth I in a different light than most English history books . The opera , written by Donizetti an Italian composer , portrays her as a woman starving for love and jealous for one man she thinks could love her . Beverly Sills presents a magnificent projection of her in this image . Her role is clearly a colorotura role and her voice , particularly in the closing aria , magnificently projects a woman lamenting her life . This opera is rarely performed in the US and I think this is so because of the plot rather than the music . A good buy and a good watch .
 For those who would no more look at an opera star than stare at a radio , this performance is sure to disappoint . The primary problem is that Sills , for whatever reason , is not in her finest voice . Anyone who listens to her earlier recording of the role , or who was lucky enough to see her in her heyday in it at NYCOpera , will immediately hear that something is awry . Nevertheless , hers was from its conception a complete performance , from stance to requisite facial expression in every scene , and though she had done better in the part , it 's better to have this four star version than none at all . What we have here is great acting in operatic melodrama , though the diva 's voice is faded , much like a worn , though rich , tapestry .
 Do n't listen to the lies that Sills ca n't be heard on this DVD . They are bashers who are jealous of Sills ' greatness smudging out her contemporaries . And THAT is the truth . Why else would they go to lengths to bash all of Sills ' greatest roles and films ? I myself have a copy of this SUPERB performance , and I can hear everyone very , very well . Did I just happen to have a `` good copy '' ? Well , my local library has a copy of this DVD , and it 's the same , just as clear and loud . And of course , Sills ' performance is so fiery and dramatic that one gets completely taken into the story , feeling her rage , angst , and despair . There is NO ONE and no other performance that can come within a mile of this dynamite performance ! This is most definitely 10-star material , A + + + . Ignore the ignorant bashers and witness Beverly Sills ' art for yourself !
 The performance is great but the sound is definitely less than CD quality -LRB- the sound mix is somewhat muddy -RRB- . Also , there are long stretches of singing with no subtitles so it might help to have a libretto handy if you really want to follow every word .
 Sills is absolutely amazing in this Roberto Devereux . She most certainly can be heard . I am one of the few that think that Sills had a large voice . Listen to many of her recordings and the sound she emits is lyrical but the sound is huge . Many times my ears have pinged when I listen to her singing . No other singer has done that for me . It 's trumpet toned , not as rich as Sutherland 's but not as heavy or droopy . She 's not as fresh as she was on her recorded performance , but the voice is larger here , perhaps a bit shriller . She is thoroughly magnificent . Listen to her last , somewhat shrill and wobbly Gilda -LRB- I still love the portrayal -RRB- and you will hear an absolutely PERFECT Lady Macbeth . What a shame we had to miss out on that.The rest of the cast is very good . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 A must for all opera lovers . Sills is riveting , her singing is superb and her acting beyond belief . The rest of the cast does a fine job . Sills makeup is astounding .
 `` I due Foscari '' is a misunderstood Verdi opera . Those who like the drama of `` Rigoletto '' will love this one . The 1951 recording is excellent . Carlo Maria Giulini conducts a very good RAI-Milan orchestra . Carlo Bergonzi was only 27 years old when he first sung Jacopo Foscari in 1951 , and this is only his second recording for Cetra or any other label . He had `` changed '' to baritone only 9 months earlier . You will love his performance . Gian Giacomo Guelfi is also excellent as Francesco Foscari . Pity that he is so little known in the USA . On the other side , Maria Vitale is just okay . She was not really a Verdi soprano -LRB- listen to her `` La Vestale '' , where she is imperial ! -RRB- . Regrettably , Parquale Lombardo is very poor as Jacopo Loredano , and this affects certain parts of the opera . Overall , this is a gem ! Much better than the studio performances of the early 70s with flashy performers , but showing poor appreciation of the opera . Grab it!N . A. Peppas
 To get to the point , first choice for this neglected early Verdi work remains with the Philips issue conducted by Gardelli with the youthful and very fine team of Carreras , Ricciarelli , Cappuccilli and Ramey , but many might like this live -LRB- before an audience -RRB- , mono , studio recording as a supplement , not least because it features Bergonzi in 1951 in only his second recording as a tenor and Guelfi as a sensitive and touching Doge before waning vocal powers tempted him into compensating by grandstanding and bellowing . The soprano , Maria Vitale , is a fine , spirited artist but a little shrill and over-parted in Verdi ; RAI house soprano Caterina Mancini would have done this better , as she does in various contemporary Cetra recordings.This is the least percussive of Verdi 's early works and suits Bergonzi 's still still slightly tremulous tenor ; he soon settled down in his new tessitura but is here already singing with delicacy and refinement in a part which requires the tenor to be uniformly afflicted and melancholy ; Bergonzi 's voice has the right plangency with reserves of focused power . Everybody - singers , chorus , orchestra and conductor - is in sympathy with the performing tradition and knows how Verdi should go.The Warner Fonit remastering is preferable to many other issues on labels which have clearly just have transferred straight from clean LP 's and retained some swish and crackle . The sound is still rather distant , crumbly and cavernous but perfectly listenable with a will . The comparative rarity of these now discontinued old Cetra/Warner Fonit discs is reflected in the fact that they can go for ridiculous prices on Amazon Marketplace , but keep looking and you can still eventually find them for very little .
 I LOVED THIS SONG WHEN ANDREA BOCCELLI DID IT AND NOW DONNA SUMMER GAVE IT A GREAT BEAT NOTHING LIKE DRIVING OVER THE VERRAZANO BRIDGE AND LISTENING TO THIS SONG !!!!!
 I Think Its The Best Song I Ever Herd Its Perfect For Clubs And The Ever So Great Make Out Sessions I Give Con Te Partiro 5 Stars but i would give it 10 if i could
 donna , mmm . . make sure its cooked . sounds like she 's close to hollywood
 This magical song made its way into the SF gay club scene about a month ago . It is mainly paired with flowers duet which is almost too much to handle . I always go to such a wonderful peacful place when I hear this song , flooding my mind with bitter sweet memories . Donna has really given us and Anthem that will live for years to come !!!!
 The song is AWESOME ! It 's a great club song . It gets you moving even when you do n't feel like it.Andrea Boccelli sang great , but Donna Summer adds a little something that made this song a really upbeat song . I LOVE IT !
 Con te partiro has shot me to the stars . . over the clouds and across the sky . I find it a spiritual force that reinforces me to achieve my goals and overcome every obstacle in my life.Its certainly more than a love song . . Its the song !
 `` I Will Go With You -LRB- Con Te Partiro -RRB- '' kicks the butt of everything I 've heard in the clubs so far this year ... the girl shows all the club-diva wannabes how it should be done ... beautiful soaring vocals with sincere passionate delivery ... and she has n't even kicked her shoes off yet , lots in reserve . The Queen 's back for her throne , pretenders make way .
 I can not understand , for the life of me , why US Pop Radio is not all over this song . It is by far , the best club song of the summer , and I get chills just humming it to myself . `` I Will Go With You '' is simply Donna Summer at her very best ; and it 's great to see the song rise to No. 1 on next weeks Billboard Club Play Chart . Now if only mainstream radio will take notice - this could take her to the level Cher has experienced this year .
 Here 's a vivid and clear example of Donna 's capability of creating a dance record out of even a `` Classical '' like this one . Not only does she makes you dance & dance & dance with this single , it also proves once more that Donna has the vocals to do a song like this.Once a `` Disco Queen '' now the `` The Queen Of All Stars !! `` Great come back Donna . . I Love You !!!!
 The minute I heard this song blast through the sound system of my favorite gay club , I fell in love . I also knew it would be a hit ... and was I right ! Donna Summer has managed to turn an already beautiful work of art into a fabulous masterpiece suitable for just about all tastes . This CD-Single is a definite must-buy !
 I saw Donna perform this song at a concert in MA last month , and it was phenominal . It was her first live performance of this song in concert . This song will undoubtedly be THE dance song for the summer . This summer belongs to Donna .
 I first heard this song on the radio and I was dancing to the music I loved it so much . I bought the single CD and I ca n't get enough of it ! It will keep you dancing and believe me , you do n't want to turn the voloume down or turn the song off . Donna Summer with this song should be crowned the queen of techno , dance , pop , etc !!!
 Hundreds of dancefloor spacetakers , hands in the air and voices rising ... pay tribute to their loved ones without missing a beat . This song swirls in your head and then dives straight to your heart , all the while keeping your feet moving at a frenetic pace!Will become the summer anthem !

 The other reviewer listed the song tracks . You get 75 songs and this set sells for under $ 20 -LRB- I got it for $ 10 -RRB- . So you definitely get your money 's worth . Some rare singers here too . Frankie Laine , Eddie Fisher , Vaughn Monroe , Dinah Shore , Peggy Lee and Kay Starr . You hardly hear any songs from them anymore , much less Christmas . There 's too many songs to comment on , but with 75 selections and singers like Bing , Frank , Dino , Doris Day , Les Brown , the Andrews Sisters , Gene Autry and Rosemary Clooney , you 're bound to hear some songs you like . I finally got to hear Kay Starr 's The Man With The Bag . If you 're wanting to get in the mood for Christmases of long ago , this CD set is the answer .
 This album proves it - Ladysmith Black Mambazo are -LRB- if not one of -RRB- the best African group of all time and listening to this album has been a very pleasant experience.New recordings of classic Mambazo hits are contained here , featuring collaborations with familiar names Sarah McLachlan -LRB- on `` Homeless '' , which originally appeared on the 1986 album `` Graceland '' with Paul Simon -RRB- , Melissa Etheridge -LRB- on `` Diamonds On The Soles Of Her Shoes '' , again from `` Graceland '' -RRB- , Natalie Merchant -LRB- on `` Rain , Rain Beautiful Rain '' , a track that originally appeared on the 1979 release `` Ezinkulu '' and the Grammy-winning 1987 `` Shaka Zulu '' -RRB- as well as many faces from South Africa.Zap Mama , headed by Marie Daulne , joins in on the group 's `` Hello My Baby '' , which originally appeared alongside `` Rain '' on `` Ezinkulu '' in 1979 , a horde of artists including Vusi Mahlasela , Hugh Masekela and Lucky Dube appear on the anthem `` Shosholoza '' , Taj Mahal and his wonderful electric guitar appear on Solomon Linda 's `` Mbube '' and we have many other songs as well ; `` Inkanyezi Nezazi -LRB- Star and the Wiseman -RRB- '' , `` How Long ? '' , `` Long Walk to Freedom '' -LRB- originally recorded in 2000 -RRB- and the South African national anthem `` Nkosi Sikelel ' iAfrika '' -LRB- God Bless Africa -RRB- - not forgetting the first song that the group 's leader/founder Joseph Shabalala ever wrote
 This CD from Ladysmith Black Mambazo , with guest singers Melissa Etheridge , Natalie Merchant , Sarah McLachlan , Emmylou Harris , Taj Mahal , Joe McBride , Zap Mama , Hugh Masakela and a who 's who of South African artists , is this multi Grammy Award winning group 's finest work in years . Since their work with Paul Simon and his `` Graceland '' CD they continue to amaze with their beautiful harmonies .
 This blend of style and content is a real feast for the soul . Fans of the group 's traditional South African vocals will like the selections that feature the blended voices and beat of their past recordings , and will be intrigued by the mix of the stylings of some new friends -- well known American , Canadian and European artists . No cultural imperialism here ... the foreigners bend their music to match that of Africa . The results are generally a treat . I found myself playing and replaying the CD when it first arrived . The layered texture of each individual song , and the similarly layered context of the entire song list , makes repeat listening not only a joy but a necessity . One final kudo
 I love each successive Ladysmith CD more than the last and this one is no exception . They 've brought together the greats of South African music and popular US stars for the most breathtakingly beautiful CD I have heard in a long time . Emmylou Harris ' version of `` Amazing Grace '' will just blow you away . Then there 's Melissa Ethridge singing Paul Simon 's part on `` Diamonds on the Soles of her Shoes . '' Plus , you 've got Zap Mama , Taj Mahal , Natalie Merchant and a host of others . This one will provide years of happy listening .
 Long Walk To Freedom is the latest music CD release of the energetic and inspirational group of South African artists Ladysmith Black Mambazo , recognizing the twentieth year of their introduction to the worldwide stage . Long Walk To Freedom consists of twelve new recordings of classic Mambazo songs , with guest vocal performances by contemporary pop music stars such as Taj Mahal , Zap Mama , Joe McBride and many more , as well as leading South African artists such as Lucky Dube , Vusi Mahlasela , and Thandiswa . Spanning the length of the band 's thirty-year history , the selected songs are Nomathemba -LRB- 4:12 -RRB- , Hello My Baby -LRB- 4:56 -RRB- , Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes -LRB- 5:42 -RRB- , Homeless -LRB- 4:11 -RRB- , Rain Rain Beautiful Rain -LRB- 3:01 -RRB- , How Long -LRB- 5:11 -RRB- , Mbube -LRB- 3:59 -RRB- , Amazing Grace/Nearer My God To Thee -LRB- 3:28 -RRB- , Nkosi Sikelel ` lAfrica -LRB- 2:26 -RRB- , Inkanyezi Nezazi `` Star and the Wiseman '' -LRB- 5:00 -RRB- , Shosholoza -LRB- 4:50 -RRB- , Long Walk To Freedom `` Halala South Africa '' -LRB- 5:11 -RRB- and Thula Thula `` Bonus Track '' 1:49 . More than just a music CD , Long Walk To Freedom doubles as a multimedia CD-ROM , PC & Macintosh compatible , with a video and artist profile and much more . A superb auditory tribute to a talented and widely beloved performance group , and a treasure especially for fans of Ladysmith Black Mambazo .
 I had seen Paul Simon 's interview and show on his album &#34; Graceland &#34; on PBS . And I saw the group called Ladysmith Black Mambazo . I was absolutely in love with &#34; Graceland &#34; and after hearing this group on that tv show , I wanted to hear more . I merely picked a few titles . I 'm glad I got them . Beautiful harmony and acapella .
 I had the CD for this and lost it . That made me crazy , so I downloaded the album from Amazon . I 'm not much of a musicologist , but I know that I like good harmony , meaningful lyrics and great melodies . This album has all of the above . Additionally , it gives the listener insight into the thoughts and hopes of people from another culture.I definitely recommend this album . Heck , I definitely recommend this group .
 If you have amassed a number of LBM 's previous albums , much of of this will be familiar . But it is n't just a `` greatest hits '' album , but a reimagining of the tunes over their long career , from Nomathemba -LRB- 1973 -RRB- to 2 songs from Paul Simon 's Graceland , to a couple songs from the Simon-produced Shaka Zulu album -LRB- 1987 -RRB- , to more recent fare . Highlights include Mbube -LRB- which you may know as The Lion Sleeps Tonight -RRB- with Taj Mahal , and Amazing Grace/Nearer My Good to Thee with Emmylou Harris .
 Nice variety of songs while still keeping with that `` special sound '' that no ones does better !
 Ladysmith is a wonderful group . Their songs are poignant and upbeat . I enjoy African music and this is the best of the best .
 Awesome sound . A very nice weave of So . Africian style and American fun ! Melissa Etheridge and Sheryl Crow and the boys sound GREAT together ... . I highly recommend it .
 Ever since their emergence on Paul Simon 's Graceland , the unique harmonies and rhythms have kept me enthtralled . The notable thing about this CD is how their famous guests adapt to their sound , choice of material , and blend is solid . Some collaborations work better than others . Mellissa Ethridge and Natalie Merchant are two standouts . This a worthwhile introduction this group .
 what can I say ? this is as good as it gets for African vocal harmonies -LRB- i spent 1974-1977 in the Central African Republic . -RRB- i really should say the best vocal harmony anywherei could talk about each song with the wonderful stars who are featuredi 'll just say that Natalie is sublime in rainshe 's as amazing as they are !!!
 Never appreciated in the Paul Simon days , think he exploited the novelty of their sound -LRB- OK , not a Simon fan -RRB- . Incedible harmonies , and teh guest stars like Melissa blend in beautifully .
 This CD is classic Ladysmith . They continue to present the songs and rythyms of Africa in their unique style .
 If you like A capella work this is a great addition to your collection .
 This cd is really good and i think you if you like the sound samples you will like the whole c.d. . The song roit riot is really good ...
 Look out Steven Curtis Chapman ! Michael O'Brien 's latest collection is truly a marvelous listening experience . Michael sings with a great deal of emotion and his voice is powerful and smooth . `` Somebody Cares '' is awesome in its positive statement of love and faith . All the tracks are powerhouses , but the best of the lot include `` Bittersweet , '' `` Until I Hear from You , '' `` Palm of Your Hand , '' and `` Souvenirs . '' Michael is not only a tremendous asset to Christian music but to the whole musical world . If you buy one Christian CD this year , make it this one !
 I 've played this CD so much if it were a cassette I would have gone through about a hundred of them . I 'm sitting at the Baked Potato on a break in 1995 and I 'm listening to the CD they 're playing on the break . Incredible drumming and drum sound . I immediately go to the bar and ask what CD this is . They say Jeff Richman . I know who this is ; one of my teachers at GIT . I also knew that the drummer would be Joel Taylor , one of my other instructors and one of my favorite drummers in LA. . This CD is a drum lesson , a statement of where drums are at , even today , 16 years later . Jeff 's guitar playing is great , as are all the players , LA heavyweights . The tunes are excellent ; I used to play this CD 4 times on the way to Vegas . BUY IT NOW ! You wo n't regret it . Kind of fusiony , not a chops fest -LRB- well , maybe on the drums -RRB- , but very listenable .
 I bought this great slice of new wave/post punk/power pop at Licorice Pizza -LRB- long gone record store -RRB- in 1981 , I never stopped listening to it ... 999 was the most overlooked band from the UK punk scene of ' 77 . They had it all
 It 's great to finally see this album released on CD . I 've wanted this for a long time . Hot on the heels of the `` Biggest Prize in Sport '' album , this was released by Polydor in the USA clearly with the idea of riding the cresting new wave . Sure , it was probably 999 's most `` commercial '' album but listeners are treated to some great catchy hard rockin ' songs . No , it 's not punk but these guys never were really prime safety pin disciples . A very consistent album . Sing along ! And what a great live band they were !
 999 is one my favorite bands . They have so much energy and talent and I love all the songs about crime , corruption and chaos . And let 's face it , this band never takes itself too seriously . Concrete is a fun listen and still sounds fresh today . The music is so direct and to the point , and with two guitars they really rock hard . Guy Days on lead guitar plays some sweet licks-he gets right to it ! Guy 's not afraid to show off his skills , which is unusual for punk of this era . Concrete is a more restrained , polished album than most of the 999 catalog , but very well done . Public Enemy Number One is a favorite cut , with a pounding beat , searing , growling riffs and outrageous lyrics . Thanks for rounding out the CD with bonus cuts-very nice !
 I saw 999 at the Starship -LRB- I think that was the name of the bar -RRB- in Milwaukee , WI in 1981 when I was 19 -LRB- you could drink liquor at 18 back then -RRB- . The Alley Cats -LRB- or was it `` Katz '' ? -RRB- opened up . Man ! 999 was a barrage of driving guitar behind Nick Cash 's seering vocals . I ca n't remember if the concert was before or after the release of Concrete , but I 'm sure they played `` So Greedy '' and `` Break It Up . '' Although previous reviewers have called Concrete `` commercial , '' I think it 's a great example of the earliest punk to new wave crossover albums . Actually , I look back now , and Concrete seems to be a pop album . The Clash was starting to enjoy real commercial success , the Sex Pistols were done , Black Flagg was gaining commercial recognition , and harder core stuff was getting popular . 999 came into the 80 's as a punk band , but they 'd been playing in various incarnations since the mid-70 's , and by the time they made Concrete , they were quite accomplished . Concrete is a tight , edgy pop album . Let 's call it hard-core pop . It 's one of my favorite albums . Ask someone you know who is in their late 30 's or early 40 's if they 've ever heard of or remember 999 . If they have n't , they 're missing out . 999 was a great band that never enjoyed the commercial success it should have .
 I played this album to death when I was younger , so I was very happy when I saw it was out on CD . The day it arrived I plopped it into my CD player and turned it up . `` Excuse me ... but who is this tired old band ? '' asked my wife . `` It 's BORRING ! '' I was speechless ! I had never thought of this as a dull album ... in fact I thought it was cool ... kind of moody , a bit pop , and maybe a little slow when compared to their earlier albums like `` High Energy Plan '' and `` Biggest Prize in Sport '' , but I was never bored by it ! In fact I had thought of it as something of an unknown Brit-Punk Classic . I guess it 's not for everyone . My recommendation would be that if you are a fan of old school punk , -LRB- You know ... pre Hard-Core like Sham 69 , Undertones , Stiff Little Fingers , and Buzzcocks -RRB- then get this . If you are more into Sandinista era Clash , Joy Division/Goth , Grunge , Ska , PIL , or good ` ol American Hard-Core , -LRB- and I like all those things , too -RRB- then I will admit , perhaps this is not for you . I think it has aged real well , but what do I know ... I 'm an Old School Jerk !
 999 Concrete cd a excellent cd , with bonus tracks.A favorite of mine from a great band . I would recommend it to anyone who likes rock n'roll . I did not know before I ordered this album it had so many bonus tracks , if I had , I would have got it sooner!Old school Paul
 This appears to be the only recording of d'Albert 's Symphony in F -LRB- not Symphony 4 but opus 4 - d'Albert only wrote one symphony -RRB- . It was called the `` world premiere recording '' when it was released in 1995 , and no others seem to have appeared since . Having listened to it several times , it 's a mystery to me why no one else has recorded it.Eug&egrave;ne d'Albert -LRB- 1864-1932 , he later preferred the German Eugen -RRB- was born in Glasgow . A piano prodigy , at age 12 he received a scholarship to the National Training School in London -LRB- later called the Royal College of Music -RRB- , where he studied under , among others , Arthur Sullivan , for whom he scored the overture to Patience shortly after turning 17 . Before he turned 18 he had performed Schumann 's Piano Concerto under Hans Richter , and soon after performed a concerto of his own composition . He became a student of Liszt , of whom he quickly became a favorite , and began a long friendship with Brahms . In 1882 , age 18 , he played for Brahms parts of a symphony he was working on , presumably this one . D'Albert 's Symphony in F had its premiere in 1884 , was played in several cities in Germany , published in 1886 , played that year in London , the next year in New York , again in Berlin in 1894 , in London again in 1898 , and in Bournemouth the next season.The Symphony had a decidedly mixed critical reception outside Germany . It 's hard to know how much this was due to the music and how much to d'Albert 's intemperate behavior . He eventually managed to earn the dislike of many of his colleagues , but already in 1884 he got a good start on alienating an entire nation with a letter to a German newspaper , translated and published in England , excoriating the British system of musical education and all things British . Some of the British reviews took note of that . Still , the work was well enough liked to receive the later performances in Germany and England mentioned above -LRB- and possibly others that I was n't able to find references to -RRB- . The second Berlin performance was at the behest of Hans von B&uuml;low , who rehearsed the symphony with his Berlin Philharmonic before he was forced to retire due to ill health.One can hear the influence of Brahms and Wagner in this symphony , and some have pointed to Tchaikovsky , Gounod and Berlioz . I think the spirit of Berlioz 's Symphonie Fantastique particularly animates the work , especially some -LRB- to me at least -RRB- unusual swaggering , strutting themes in the later movements . The four movements are all at least 11 minutes long , with a total length of a little under 50 minutes in this performance . -LRB- An early performance was reported at 55 minutes . -RRB- The structure is conventional , with a moderately quickly-paced movement at each end , and a slow movement and scherzo in between . It begins in a pastoral mode , and goes through the expected ups and downs . The most instantly attention-getting part is the third movement which , after an elegiac slow movement , begins in a downright jolly way , with a hop and a skip in its step that builds to something of a parade , slows down for some more reflective strolling , and then builds back up to a rousing finish . -LRB- Even the dyspeptic , and I think careless , New York Times review of the American premiere liked this movement . -RRB- The fourth movement begins in a grave manner , with the call of a horn and a somber theme , but eventually returns , intermittently , to the more jaunty feel of the third , which in turn keeps giving way to increasing agitation until the strutting march returns in full glory.As the reference to the Symphonie Fantastique might suggest , this music sounds like it has a program . It 's easy to imagine some parts in correlation with the young age and reportedly impetuous nature of the composer . The piece is free of much that suggests Wagnerian pretense , and though there was an early complaint of its being repetitious and another that it was long , it strikes me as moderate in its development and not indulgent in longueurs . The main strutting theme -LRB- as I think of it -RRB- that occurs in the later movements is announced distinctly , in a couple snippets , in the first movement , and other material also occurs in more than one movement . The music is well orchestrated , with plenty of color and detail . The themes are pleasant , some quite catchy . D'Albert is fond of pulsing strings playing under melodies , sometimes with peculiar rhythmic effect . There is occasional counterpoint.The performance here gets the music across pretty well . The orchestra is n't quite top notch , and some muddiness can be heard at times , but they generally give the music good momentum and verve . I 've been enjoying the piece as presented here , as much as or more than performances of the lesser known symphonies of more famous composers of the period.The other piece on this CD , the Concerto for Cello and Orchestra in C , was written in 1899 . By this time d'Albert was firmly established as one of the world 's leading pianists , but he wanted , as he said Liszt did , to be a composer first and performer second . At opus number 20 , his works included several operas , two string quartets , two piano concertos , a piano sonata and several other pieces for solo piano . His only piece that has remained in the repertoire , the opera Tiefland , was yet to come . His works by then were regarded by some as slight , but he also had his champions.The Cello Concerto is modest in comparison to the Symphony . In this performance it 's 22 minutes , with no break between its three movements . It 's conservative , unpretentious , well crafted , with limited dramatic tension , some beautiful if not highly distinctive ideas compactly developed . It 's quite enjoyable and worth repeated hearings . Though my initial impression was that it 's not that memorable , one of the themes has been running through my mind today.The soloist , Antonio Meneses , and perhaps the recording of his cello , does n't do the piece full justice . While the somewhat distant recording of the solo instrument probably presents a realistic balance such as one might hear in a concert , it is n't ideal for home listening . The cello 's sound is on the small , thin side . Meneses generally plays very well , but his intonation is smudged in quick passages . There have been several other recordings of this piece . If you only want one recording of it , and are n't interested in the Symphony , reviews suggest the newer recording by Alban Gerhardt and Carlos Kalmar on the Hyperion label -LRB- here -RRB- is a better bet.In sum , the Symphony is an interesting and engaging work worth seeking out for lovers of the Late Romantics , especially those who crave unusual or obscure works . The Cello Concerto is a fine small addition to the repertoire but is available elsewhere in what is reputed to be a better performance and recording .
 This album has been quite hard to get a hold of for a while , but here it is , remastered and featuring Howlin ' Wolf backed by his powerful early-70s combo , the Wolf Gang , which included guitarists Hubert Sumlin and L.V. Williams , bassist Dave Myers , drummer extraordinaire Fred Below , legendary piano player Sunnyland Slim , and saxist Eddie Shaw.Wolf himself was in his early sixties at the time this recording was made , and starting to suffer from ill health , but he could still rise to his former heights when it came to winning over an audience.This album was originally issued on LP in 1972 , and featured eight songs . Two excellent bonus tracks were added when it was re-released on CD , extending the running time to just under 65 minutes , and Wolf and his band sound thoroughly inspired all the way through . Howlin ' Wolf does n't perform any of his classic hits , but once you slip this disc into your CD player and turn up the volume you will hardly notice . These powerful live versions of songs like the driving `` I Did n't Know '' , Big Bill Broonzy 's `` I Had A Dream '' -LRB- in a thumping high-octane rendition -RRB- , and the gritty `` Do n't Laugh At Me '' are every bit as great as any Willie Dixon-penned R&B ; hit.Opening with the eight-minute `` When I Laid Down I Was Troubled '' , Wolf and the band swagger through one blues powerhouse after another , mostly mid-tempo numbers with a few slow grinds thrown in for good measure , like the supremely funky `` The Big House '' . Wolf 's vocal performance on that one is one of his best ever ; he stretches out comfortably for over seven minutes , singing certain verses he likes two or three times as the band locks in with deadly authority . And the other bonus cut , `` Mr Airplane Man '' , is Wolf working his one-riff voodoo for all it 's worth , a swinging , soulful sax riff and a groove deep enough to get lost in.You wo n't find a tougher , more enjoyable live blues record anywhere . Muddy 's Newport album is great , and so is John Lee Hooker 's `` Live At The Caf&eacute; Au Go Go -LRB- And Soledad Prison -RRB- '' , but this pulsating steam engine is live blues at its very best and grooviest . The sound is not truly stellar , in spite of the remastering , but once you turn it up and start rocking back and forth in your seat with your eyes closed , you wo n't care one bit .
 This is vintage wolf . His long time sax player , eddie shaw , and of course hubert on guitar really smoke . This cd has great sound -LRB- for 1972 -RRB- , remastered , and in stereo . Wolf 's voice never did suffer even the following the year after a car accident . Well worth the price-my favorite wolf cd , with `` real folk blues '' a second . Combine with magic sam 's `` Black Magic '' make for some rockin ' blues
 This box has some pretty good things in it - best of all are the excellent Beethoven Second and Third symphonies , from his multi-orchestra cycle -LRB- the rest can be had on two DG Doubles - on no account miss his wonderful Pastoral with the Orchestre de Paris -RRB- . In fact the Berlin PO Eroica here is one of my favourites , a ` slightly slower than normal ' rather than ` slow ' Eroica , with wonderful playing and interpretative touches . Superbly recorded in 1971 too . The earlier Bavarian Seventh is perhaps a tad relaxed compared to the finest versions.The complete live Gurrelieder is also fine , perhaps a notch below modern readings by Chailly , Rattle and Sinopoli but still enjoyable , especially with Inge Borkh as Tove.The Dvorak String Serenade is good - but just not as good as the live one he did on Orfeo . The modern works by Jean Martinon -LRB- the conductor -RRB- , Tcherepnin and Kubelik himself are interesting but not really music of the highest quality , though the two symphonies -LRB- 4 and 8 -RRB- by his close friend Karl Amadeus Hartmann are worth hearing in definitive performances here.Other entries include a nice Mozart Haffner Serenade , a couple of Stravinsky bonbons , three less well-known Weber overtures , and the famous Mendelssohn Midsummer Night 's Dream incidental music - but here prefaced by over half an hour of rehearsal extracts , pleasingly given a full translation in the booklet.A worthwhile set even if not all the contents are top drawer , as the playing , recordings and presentation are all very fine .
 Rafael Kubelik was , in my view , one of the most gifted and significant conductors in modern time , which is exemplified by his outstanding recordings of Mahler 's , Dvor&aacute;k 's , and Jan&aacute;cek 's music . This box - which ought to be a bargain set , even in the US , because that is what it is at amazon.co.uk -LRB- 17.87 = $ 36 -RRB- - collects some of his less well-known recordings.First , however , one must note that DG , for some odd reason , has decided to include parts of Kubelik 's famous and fine Beethoven cycle in this box -LRB- symphonies 1-3 -RRB- , instead of releasing them in a separate twofer as is the case of the rest of this cycle . In addition , there is also a very fine performance of Beethoven 's seventh symphony , with Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunk , which was not part of Kubelik 's cycle.Second , we find a selection of rarely recorded works , such as Tcherepnin 's piano concertos nos. 2 & 5 , with the composer at the piano , Martinon 's second violin concerto , Hartmann 's fourth and eight symphonies , and Kubelik 's own `` Quattro forme per archi '' . These works are very interesting , and the performances are first rate.Finally , there are such well-known works as Mozart 's `` Haffner '' serenade , Dvor&aacute;k 's serenade for strings -LRB- both are outstanding -RRB- , Stravinsky 's Scherzo &agrave; la Russe and Circus polka , three Weber overtures -LRB- Abu Hassan , Preciose , and Jubel-ouvert &uuml;re -RRB- , Mendelssohn 's Midsummer Night 's Dream -LRB- rehearsal of the overture is included -RRB- , and Sch&ouml;nberg 's `` Gurrelieder '' -LRB- these two are cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me as well -RRB- . Especially the Sch&ouml;nberg piece is of great interest - in my view , it 's the best Gurrelieder that we currently have on record . Both as a performance and as a recording , it deserves all praise.Recordings are clear , though somewhat close-miked analogue stereo , but technically satisfying in fine remasterings.Warmly recommended -LRB- even at a too high US price -RRB- !
 This recent offering in the `` Original Masters '' series presents 8 CDs of `` Rare Recordings '' made by conductor Rafael Kubelik between 1963 and 1974 for Deutsche Grammophon . As most of his discography has been readily available for years , serious collectors would probably have to question whether there were indeed enough unissued Kubelik performances to comprise a set of this nature . And while there are a few items contained on this set that have been reissued previously -LRB- not to mention a few items that could have been included instead -RRB- , this box set offers some real treasures.First let me say once more that I am distressed that so many of the recent DG & Decca OM sets are being sold only as pricey imports -LRB- see my reviews of the Julius Katchen and Jean Martinon sets in particular -RRB- . I waited a good six months to buy this set because I was n't about to pay three figures for it here . While some vendors in the Amazon Marketplace are beginning to offer it for less , the cheapest place I found to buy this set was HMV Japan . Additionally , that website is carrying the most recent -LRB- July 2006 -RRB- batch of Decca/Philips OM sets featuring Ataulfo Argenta , Arthur Grumiaux , Clara Haskil and Pierre Monteux , which Amazon is n't even offering yet.Anyway on to the music in this fine set . The gems here are both by the most recognizable of composers , and also by rather obscure ones . By recognizable I mean Beethoven , and in particular Kubelik 's performances of Symphonies 1-3 & 7 , which comprise discs 2 & 3 . In the early 1970s DG allowed Kubelik to record a Beethoven Cycle with a different Orchestra for each Symphony . Symphonies 4-6 and 7-9 have been available on two different DG `` 2CD '' titles -LRB- see my review of 4-6 -RRB- , but until now the remaining ones have been unissued . Also , a magnificent earlier 1970 account of the 7th with the Bavarian RSO is tossed in here as a bonus . The other highlights are the works of more obscure composers -- Hartmann 's 4th and 8th Symphonies , Tcherepin 's 2nd & 5th Piano Concertos , conductor Jean Martinon 's Violin Concerto No. 2 , and even Kubelik 's own `` Quattro Forme per Archi , '' a most pleasant surprise!However , the set is not without its problems . Price aside , there are some performances that serious collectors may already have . The Mendelssohn `` Midsummer Night 's Dream '' music , which with the exception of some rehearsal outtakes comprises the whole of disc 8 , has been available in a DG Import budget line title for several years now . Also the 3 Weber Overtures were recently reissued on a Weber disc in the Universal budget line -LRB- see my review -RRB- -- hardly making them rare ! Additionally , Schoenberg 's `` Gurreleider '' leaves a lot to be desired , but that is just my personal preference as the recording did win the Grand Prix du Disque . I think DG would have been better served had they included some of Kubelik 's now out-of-print Janacek or Smetana recordings , or the Wagner , Bartok or Martinu performances that are currently available only in Japan , instead of the aforementioned selections . Yet as is , Kubelik 's `` Rare Recordings '' is a real treat , just make sure you do n't pay too much for it .
 `` Yesterday 's Tomorrow '' , a 2-disc set , has been making the rounds on my cd player pretty frequently for the past several months . Both cds are full of awesome , original rock music - Some of it sexy , some angry , some sweet . The electric cello really adds to their originality and takes the music to another level . Formula 151 definitely has `` it '' .
 Peter Tosh is a genious , ahead of his time and this ablum proves it .
 A reviewer wrote that he could n't respect Peter because he was an egomaniac . Wrong . Peter loved Bob , but wanted people tostop living in the past and to accept him for who he was andwhere he wanted to go . He did not attend Bob 's funeral . Iwonder how he would want to be remembered considering howviolently he died ? This album was one of many great solorecords ... there were a few bad ones as well .
 From the moment I heard the song `` Legalize It '' , I knew I had to own the album . It is one of the greatest reggae albums of all time . From beginning to end , this album makes us realize what a force Peter Tosh was and is to reggae music . His distinct personality shines on this album and lets us know he was the militant of the Wailers . `` Let Jah Be Praised '' is so strong , `` Ketchy Shuby '' is timeless . If there is one Tosh album you need in your collection , this is it .
 this man produced a brillant and honest piece of work on this masterpiece.as the past reviewer said and i agree i dug every song on this disc.and in a fair world he would have been more well recieved when he was alive.still the genius of his work makes him feel among us then many of the artists that we have today .
 In my opinion , Peter Tosh 's finest album . There is not one mediocre track , each one being equally brilliant . The music on this collection like on so many Tosh recordings , sounds fresh , new , and inspiring . `` No Sympathy '' , `` Till your well runs dry '' and `` Igziabehr '' are among the highlights of the album . The first two being new versions of songs recorded and released while Tosh was still a Wailer and the third brand new . The band is made up of all the Wailers of that period except , significantly , Bob Marley . If the album cover and title `` Legalize it '' puts images of just another marijuana smoking Rastafarian in your head , think again . This is among the finest works of one of the most overlooked men in history .
 Peter Tosh-Legalize It **** Breaching classic Reggae of peace and love with the then new and revolutionary style of reggae of standing up for your rights and basically adopting a ` Malcolm X Mentality ' in the lyrics Peter Tosh managed to create one of the most legendary reggae albums of all time , as well as one of the most important.Though most of the backing band was borrowed from Tosh 's band mate Bob Marley it does n't show as they seem to play in a fresh and new style from what they were playing with Marley at the time . This is also apparent in Tosh 's vocal styling which are very different then that of Marley 's . Not to mention the heavy bottom sound as oppose to Marley 's love of a treble filled tone.The songs on the albums are amazing and many of which went on to become reggae and music classics . The title track ` Legalize It ' is one of the most popular and important songs in the genres history . Whether or not you agree with the songs message makes no difference because it is a great song no matter what . ` No Sympathy ' is not only the strongest song on the album but in my opinion the very best song that Tosh would ever record . It is truly brilliant with a smooth groove , and chorus to get lost in . ` Why Must I Cry ' is another classic though I feel it is sometimes over looked by Tosh fans because of the other classics on the album . The spiritual praise of ` Igziabeher -LRB- Let Jah Be Praised -RRB- ' can rival anything Marley was releasing at this point in his career.Tosh left Bob Marley & The Wailers to see if he could make it on his own and not live in the shadow of Marley for the rest of his career , I think he proved him self with this , his first album.When it is all sad and over Legalize It is not Peter Tosh best album , and in fact it is far from it but it is still one of the better reggae albums of all time , not to mention important . Over time Tosh would develop into one of the biggest names in reggae release masterpiece after masterpiece . Aside from Legalize It , other Tosh albums to check out would be Bush Doctor , Equal Rights , and maybe Mystic Man if you enjoy the others .
 Peter Tosh 's `` Legalize It '' shook the musical world with its fiery messages and its bold honesty in the ideal to legalize marijuana . Never before had an album been so outright in its message . `` Legalize It '' was an instant success with songs like its title track alongside the somber , dark remake numbers like `` Burial , '' and `` No Sympathy '' -LRB- both originally done with the Wailers in the 1960 's -RRB- . Peter Tosh had now become Bob Marley 's rival , and although he remains underappreciated , `` Legalize It '' shows Peter Tosh 's legendary work and his promise to come .
 tosh 's talent really shines on this album . the album contains some of the most heart-felt songs against oppression . however , there are some catchy tunes as well . tosh 's reminds us to stand strong with songs like `` why must i cry '' and `` whatcha gon na do . ''
 to me tosh is the true reggae god . Then bob then toots the spear then jimmy then uharu , ect . peter is the best reggae performer and this is his best studio album . get it . you 'll like it .
 `` Ketchy '' beats , great lyrics , and awesome sound . I 've had this cd for a few years and it is still one my favorites . A must get .
 The title track is the most important on the album , being the central cry of herbs men all over the globe . It is a battle cry for Legalizing a great mystical pleasure.Other songs are instant reggae classics such as Burial , No Sympathy , and Why Must I Cry which was co-written by Bob Marley . This is made with musicians mostly from the Wailers and has a great sound .
 Tosh 's first solo album is every bit as good as his mentor 's , and in some places even better - there 's considerably more diversity here , and the bottom-heavy sound is a nice deviation from Marley 's emphasis on treble . The songs follow a general pattern - syncopated , stripped-down reggae - but mostly include a few special touches to keep things from getting thin
 Great album ! As I said on my review for &#34; Equal Rights &#34; I 'm not a smoker , never been . I 'm not into politics either . I 'm loving it for the music and vibe . As with &#34; Equal Rights &#34; this reissue is a killer with all the bonuses . But if you 're not into PT so much , and you want only a taste of what he sounds like , get the &#34; Gold Collection &#34; . If you 're like me you 'll end up buying the 3 of them anyway -LRB- Gold ... / Legalize ... / Equal ... -RRB- and groove to them . So you 'll give your Bob Marley cd 's a break , lol !
 LEGALIZE IT is the first solo album released by the legendary Peter Tosh who was the rebel of The Wailers and one of the most under appreciated artists of the 20th century . He accomplished so much prior to his tragic death in 1987 , he was a self taught musician who taught Bob Marley and Bunny Wailer how to play guitar . His songs were the most revolutionary in the bands catalog and his strong personality was both admired an feared . He and Bunny left The Wailers in 1974 and began their own careers to more openly express their own message and ideas . Bob had begun to dominate the band with his immense talent and they felt that their message needed to be more readily explored and accessible.Peter , never being one to shy away from a controversial topic , hit the ground running with this wonderful album . The album cover and title track caused quite the stir when released and Tosh would n't have had it any other way ! He was known to fire up a joint right before walking out on stage and allow the ganja to inspire him throughout the performance . The lyrics of the song speaks to the hypocrisy of the laws against weed when , as his sang , judges , lawyers , nurses , doctors , patients , animals , etc where actively partaking of the herb . But this album is much more that his platform for the defense of ganja.He also touches upon sadness/heartache -LRB- No Sympathy & Why Must I Cry -RRB- , Rastafarian Spiritualism -LRB- Igziabether -RRB- , death -LRB- Burial -RRB- amongst other topics and this is also an album that showcases his overall genius as a musician as he wrote , produced , played guitar . Although this technically is a solo album , members of The Wailers also performed or co wrote a couple of songs , Why Must I Cry
 Brilliant extra material . Every song is a classic . The dub versions are really great . A must for every reggae and Peter Tosh fan
 This is a great first album for Peter Tosh . Highly recommended . The only thing I did n't like about this album was the additional instrumental track of Catchy Shuby . It sounds like they clipped together some of the individual instrument tracks and added a few background vocals . I ca n't understand why they would do that.Overall , great album to listen to if you are a Peter Tosh fan like me .
 This album seems like a good place to start once your Marley albums become well-worn . It obviously uses the same basic template but does augment enough originality to warrant the standout citation , and the few songs that really do stand out and transcend the oh-so-prevalent wah-wah tyranny can matter even more .
 You 've read the rave reviews . This album is amazing . Even though this is Tosh 's first solo album , Bob Marley graciously let Peter use the Wailers band for the music on it . Also , Rita Marley , Judy Mowatt -LRB- 2 of the I-Threes -RRB- and Bunny Wailer sing backup on it . Do n't waste any more time . The best songs are `` Burial , '' `` Whatcha Gon na Do , '' `` Why Must I Cry '' -LRB- co-written by Bob Marley -RRB- and `` Brand New Second Hand . '' If you do n't have it and you love reggae , shame on you . It 's not quite as serious in subject matter as his subsequent releases , but it is still classic Peter Tosh . It wo n't disappoint .
 That 's right . `` Legalize it '' tops Bob Marley 's Natty Dread and Bunny 's Blackheart Man . This is the realist Roots Reggae album made ! From the legalization of herb to the explanation of why Rastas do n't attend funerals , `` Legalize it '' is an essential blueprint of Rasta life , wants , and beliefs . Peter touches on heartbreak with songs like `` Why must I Cry '' and `` Brand new second hand . '' It 's no secret , Peter Tosh is the greatest Wailer !!
 This is a brilliant first album I think compared to the other 2 Wailers first solo albums Peter definately had a jewel in Legalize It . This album shows every side of Peter from the ganja anthems to the love songs this CD has it all . I recomend it to all reggae fans .
 I am a Bob Marley fan myself , so I thought this Album was great . Not quite as good as Bob Marley though . The tunes sound the same , even some of the lyrics sound the same . But go out and buy it , you may like it , I did !!!!!!
 More than Bob Marley and Bunny Wailer , it was Peter Tosh who gave the Wailers their harder edge and roots credibility on famous tracks like `` 400 Years , '' `` One Foundation , '' as well as his work on `` Get Up , Stand Up . `` It should come as no surprise , then , that Tosh took on all comers in his solo career , as well , with `` Legalize It '' and `` Equal Rights '' being 2 of the most militant offerings this side of Burning Spear 's `` Marcus Garvey . `` On `` Legalize It , '' Tosh 's roots sensibilities are sharp , with beautiful rastafarian numbers like `` Let Jah Be Praised '' mixed well with his all out assaults on the government 's anti herb policies , -LRB- `` Legalize It '' -RRB- and self pity and fear -LRB- `` Why Must I Cry , '' `` No Sympathy '' -RRB- . He also manages to talk to the naughty side of things on his tracks `` Ketchy Shuby , '' and the Wailers ' throwout tune `` Brand New Second Hand . `` The album 's tour de force is Tosh himself , and his voice - a rough and ready , gritty tenor that in no way weraks of complacency ; it strikes a deep , resonant chord - that of fear - but can also at moments , like on `` Let Jah Be Praised , '' be almost soothing and re-assuring . This lp is a must have in any respectable reggae collection , and is one of reggae 's shining moments and brilliant debuts .
 Peter Tosh 's first solo album proved beyond doubt that this artist 's talent and vision was far reaching enough to break through the small confines of his little Jamaican island to reverberate across the music world enjoying great critical acclaim being even more popular today than when it was first released.As one of the original founders of the legendary Wailers , Peter Tosh always felt stifled musically and after Island Records decided to rename the group `` Bob Marley & the Wailers '' for international appeal it was more than the angry rebel 's pride could take . Tosh stayed with the group for their first two albums , contributing much to their initial success with gems like `` 400 Years , '' `` Stop That Train '' and the mighty `` Get Up , Stand Up . '' Not to mention his incredible ability with the guitar , giving the band its original edge . His amazing compositions for songs like `` Concrete Jungle , '' and `` Stir It Up '' are irreplaceable.Becoming more disgruntled with all the attention Bob Marley was getting , Tosh finally left the band along with Bunny Livingston to pursue his own solo career . If their were any skeptics as to whether Peter Tosh could make it as an international star without Bob Marley , they were shamelessly silenced in 1976 as `` Legalize It '' showed that Tosh was more than capable of holding his own . Of course , that 's an understatement . The truth is , `` Legalize It '' has become one of the most colossal Reggae albums of all time!A photograph of the 6 ' 3 '' Reggae singer curled up in a field of ganja -LRB- perhaps his own -RRB- , smoking the sacramental herb of the Rastafarian religion in his pipe adorns the cover sleeve . His premature `` dreadlocks '' crown the head throwing shadows over his eyes ; the cover of this album is worth the entire CD ! The yellow border saying `` collector 's choice '' that used to outline the cover has been dropped for the CD 's reissue making the picture larger.The songs included in the set are remakes of the artist 's most popular singles during the early 70 's trying to develop his own solo career while working with the Wailers at the same time . The psychedelic title track opens the album followed by the stunning `` Burial . '' '' ... you want I comma comma funeral , yet no one bury I. . . '' he sings -LRB- Rastas do n't believe in attending funerals -RRB- . `` Why Must I Cry '' is one of the few love songs Peter Tosh has and `` Igziabeher '' is an absolute masterpiece . Also check out the countryfied `` Till Your Well Runs Dry . `` A couple songs are a bit naive -LRB- almost like children 's songs -RRB- but overall a classic album .
 `` Legalize it '' , Peter 's first solo album after he left the Wailers in 1974 , is quite simply his best effort , with 1977 's `` Equal Rights '' coming close and of course more socially and politically relevant . But on the scale of musicality , none touches `` Legalize it '' . The hard-driving rhythm section of the Barrett Brothers ... lead guitar from the ` steppin ' razor ' himself ... finally Peter could express himself as a solo artist , free from the artistic constraints of being a Wailer and being in the shadow of his student , Bob Marley . Peter is not an ` egomaniac ' as someone on this forum commented ; he simply spoke the truth very bluntly and this was a bit too difficult for some people to deal with . Yes he did teach Bob to play the guitar ; saying so made it sound like blasphemy . Could it be , as he asserted , that he was just too black for some people ? I tend to agree ... Nonetheless , this is one of reggae 's greatest albums , definitely one that will always find it 's way back to my cd player .
 If for some reason you have not heard this recording I suggest you trust me and go out and pick this up . Legalize it stands out as one of my all time favorite reggae cd 's . It is raw and spiritual.Peter offers up some powerful music on this one . From the herb anthem Legalize it to the spiritual Igziabeher -LRB- Let Jah Be Praised -RRB- to the painfully true Brand New Second Hand . Burial starts out with a slow dirge played on horns which quickly changes to the upbeat militant reggae masterpiece . All songs are quality here and will satisfy you greatly.Do a little research on the man and you will appreciate his music a little more .
 After disbanding with The Wailers -LRB- Bob Marley and Bunny Wailer -RRB- , the Wailers guitarist recorded some of the best music he would ever commit to tape . All tracks great , with great guitar licks from Peter Tosh , while Al Anderson and Donald Kinsey fill in at lead guitar . `` Legalize It , Burial , No Sympathy , Why Must I Cry , Igziabeher , Ketchy Shuby , and Brand New Second Hand '' are among the best songs on this set . But even the others are worth repeating . 5 stars , a must buy .
 Tosh created Legalize It immediately following the breakup of the Wailers , about the same time Bob Marley released Rastaman Vibration and Bunny Wailer Blackheart Man -- and , to me , it has all these years seemed vastly inferior to those two great records . The vocal was buried a mishmash of strange musical choices . The bass and drums were buried and the immediacy that lends roots reggae so much of its moral authority was lacking . Tosh , or somebody , had buried his music is a plethora of overdubs . It was if , horrors ! , I had wandered into a Yes record.Well , Peter Tosh certainly made it up with Equal Rights , one of the finest roots reggae records ever , and cemented his reputation as a worthy member of the greatest musical group of the Sixties , the Wailers/Upsetters combination . So I did not think about it very much -- and I did not listen to Legalize It very much either.The Legacy Edition 's Legalize It linear notes leave something to be desired -LRB- I do find it annoying to try and read prose on colored paper with pictures , if anyone who has anything to say about this is bothering to read this . -RRB- so I am not sure what happened . BUT -LRB- and here I disagree strongly with the other reviewers -RRB- the Jamacian mix is vastly different and vastly superior to the mix that Columbia originally released . The vocal is predominant -- Tosh 's strong bass voice sounds prophetic . The bass and drums are next in the mix and very rootsy . This is an incredibly strong roots album . I will have to live with it a while before decide how good -- I already love it and think Columbia did us roots reggae fans a disservice all those years ago , since I find it hard to believe they could n't have released this version . This is the version of Legalize It to buy.You do wind up with the inferior original release , and a bunch of demos , plus a couple of dubs . Tosh is NOT a dub master , and his dubs have more a curiosity value than any real quality . The original Jamacian version of Legalize It more than compensates you for those inferior tracks . It is a great album .
 With the release of `` Legalize It '' in 1976 , Peter Tosh proved he was a force to be reckoned with in the world of reggae music . It only takes one listen of the album to realize how much he had grown up since his time with The Wailers . Though only 9 songs long , Tosh 's debut solo album made an indelible mark in music that can still be felt 35 years later.Having said that , the recently-released Legacy Edition of `` Legalize It '' is a little bit too much for the casual listener to handle . Spread out over 2 discs are a total of 32 songs , but none of them stray too terribly far from the original album 's formula . Sure , we get demo versions of 7 of the original 9 songs , but they sound an awful lot like the album versions . Same goes for the Original Jamaican Mixes , the very first cut of the record sent out by Tosh himself . The only tracks truly worth listening to on this collection are the dub versions found at the end of disc 2 . Otherwise , this collection winds up sounding a bit too redundant.My suggestion
 The best album of Peter Tosh , and my personal all-time best reggae album.Incredible songs like No Sympathy , Burial , Why Must I Cry ... incredible meaning lyrics and phenomenol music and sound efects.It really is a 5 stars album .
 I tend to agree with the sentiments expressed in Comment Man 's earlier review . `` Legalize It '' was one of my gateway albums into the world of reggae back when it first came out in 1976 . However , after further exploration , I headed for much deeper waters and never looked back . After discovering the likes of The Abyssinians , Culture , Burning Spear and The Wailers early Lee Perry-produced material , I eventually dismissed `` Legalize It , '' as I viewed it as too slick and an obvious attempt to `` crossover '' to the international market . It was n't the choice of tunes or Mr. Tosh 's performance that bothered me but the -LRB- at times -RRB- lame overdubs that killed the record for me , especially the overuse of cheesy synthesizer sounds that completely ruined tracks like `` What ` cha Gon na Do '' and `` Ketchy Shuby '' among others . But to re-visit the record after all these years and hear the original Jamaican mix was an extraordinary listening experience . Others will no doubt disagree but I find that the JA version blows the more commercial CBS version away . The album is altogether more rootsy and the original JA mix allows Mr. Tosh 's vocals , full of dread and menace , to really shine . The beauty of this Legacy Edition is that you do n't have to choose -- fans who prefer the album as they 've always known it will be very pleased with the fine remastering and upgraded packaging , while others will delight in hearing both mixes and all the bonus material . Either way , at $ 14 or so , this purchase was a no-brainer for me and should fully satisfy old fans and newcomers alike . Crank it and enjoy , friends !
 Peter Tosh / Legalize It
 Legalize It could very well be Peter 's best album . There 's a little bit of everything on this album , including the humorous Legalize It , the excellent Igziabeher , and a softer side of Peter on Ketchy Shuby . But some more real talent is on the old Wailers classics , Burial , No Sympathy , and Brand New Second Hand . My favorite track is Why Must I Cry , co-written by Bob Marley . Every track is good in it 's own right , and this is a great cd to buy for any collection .
 This is one of my favorite reggae discs . I can listen to it over and over ... . it has a certain hypnotic quality that draws you into the rythym and the catchy lyrics . ` Burial ' is just a classic reggae track in my opinion .
 It 's true that Tosh was the most politically militant of the Wailers , but as a songwriter he is often underappreciated . Several cuts here show his tender side , most notably `` Why Must I Cry '' , a song of heartbreak that reveals the vulnerability beneath the hard exterior . '' ... I 'll never fall in love again / 'cause only the heart feels the pain . . '' is as personal a lyric as anything he ever wrote . `` Burial '' is another standout ; a beautiful harmonized melody about why you 'll never see a Rasta at a funeral -LRB- they do n't believe in them -RRB-
 Peter Tosh of The Wailers throws down some wicked Jamaican reggae on Legalize It . He stays a true Rastafari by letting the world know his view about ganja . The cover shot of the CD is classic also . Musically it 's Irie . Totally laid back groovin ' tunes . Excellent record to get cool with . This is old school roots rockin ' reggae.Some of my favorites are
 More a comment rather than a review : I received my purchase of Legalize It -LRB- Legacy Edition -RRB- and Equal Rights -LRB- Legacy Edition -RRB- in the mail today . For almost 30 years I have been more than a casual Peter Tosh listener and today I got to listen to some 45 tracks/versions which I 'd never heard before . For me this is something to celebrate.THANK YOU to everyone involved in releasing the two Tosh Legacy editions ! Thank you for keeping Peter 's music , voice and philosophies alive!I miss the Bush Doctor dearly and I know he will never be silenced .
 peter tosh shines on this recording , which is a true testament to his brilliance . this is an album where every song holds their own . this is peter 's weapon .
 very powerful album.very to the point.he was very talented and had alot to say.i agree in a fair world he would have been large.he could do so much musically.as much as i dig this set the box set is even better.a true talent.this disc still sounds great almost 25 years later .
 ... Bob Marley , I do n't want to hear it.I know , I know , he was part of the Wailers ... This is reggae.You do n't have to make it your first , but it should be your last.For more , you might want to check out Wanted Dead and Alive .
 this was a gift for my brother . the price was right and he loved it .
 The album is off the hook , the music is similar to Souled Out a group from England . Lugo 's vocals are spiritual . This group is Soul to Soul with Mark Anthony served with Johnnie Walker Blue over ice , Just smooth
 I was fortunate to hear Watermark live years ago . Just Christy and Nathan , a guitar and a piano . They sang the first five cuts from this , their debut release , and it was probably the most incredible acoustic performance I 've ever experienced . Christy has a gorgeous , expressive voice -- sometimes warm and rich , and other times almost ethereal -- and Nathan is beyond impressive on both the guitar and the piano . Performing live , they are simply magical.I 've followed their career for years now , and this is still my favorite release . This music would be considered `` praise and worship '' , and it is certainly that . They write their own music , reflecting their own personal yet universal experiences on the Christian walk.This is an essential release for fans of acoustic contemporary Christian music . It 's music that speaks of encouragement , hope and steadfast faith in the love of Christ .
 Husband and wife Nathan and Christy Nockels -LRB- more commonly known as `` Watermark '' -RRB- are two of the most anointed musicians I have ever heard perform . They display an incredible gift for both writing and singing all of their own music . Each song on this album drips with sincerity , honesty , and love for the Lord . Whether you are lisitening to the upbeat , uplifting tempo of `` Take Me There '' , the imagery-filled love song , `` Gloria '' or the willing surrender in `` Everything '' , you will be blessed each time you lsten to this album . Just as there is a variety of subject matter presented on this project , there is also a wide range of vocal style . Christy Nockels ' unique voice belts through self-revealing ballads like `` Driven to Humility '' and `` Welcome to Delaware '' while it also flows gently through quiet , prayerful melodies such as the angelic tunes of `` Calm the Waters '' and `` Peace . '' Most importantly , this collection of songs draws the listener into worship . As I said already , you will be blessed each time you listen to this album .
 I know a lot of people say this is a good CD for people over 40 and things like that , and I 'm sure it is . But I 'm only 15 and I love it . Y' all , Nathan and Christy Nockels are the coolest people ... I 've been listening to them and loving them since long before they were `` discovered '' by Rocketown . There is no voice on Earth that beats Christy 's . Watermark 's music just makes you want to sing out and praise God in such wonderful ways . -LRB- Hey , I got ta add in a little recognition to Christy 's awesome brother , Homey The Clown -RRB- . Oh , and if you 've never heard `` Welcome To Delaware '' , well ... you should !
 This is the second CD that I have purchased by these annointed children of God . The lyrics of their songs are so spiritual and the blending of their voices are phenomenal as is the backing orchestration.The song `` Calm the Waters '' is a wonderful reminder of how God changes our point of view , saves us and calms our souls.by giving us His direction . ` What Manner of Love ' describes so poignantly God 's love for His children and how He sets us free and gives us His joy and peace.The amazing accoustic backing guitar in ` His Renown ' is complimented by the duet of their voices as they remind us that we need to live our lives so that we mirror Christ and His love and compassion for a fallen world.The song ` Walk the Road ' turns our eyes to Jesus and His beautiful hands and feet ... baring the scars of what He did for us on Calvary 's cross . His wounds give us life and we should use this life to glorify God . ` Driven to Humility ' reminds us that we are chosen to be humble and to walk ` humbly with our God ' , chosing only His will for our lives.The song ` Peace ' depicts so aptly God 's peace in our hearts and souls that only comes from knowing Christ 's love for us and His peace that passes all understanding.My favourite song on this album is ` Gloria ' . All creation praises God and we long to praise Him in the same manner but it is an awesome thought that we are treasured by God above all creation.As I listen to ` Take me There ' I am reminded that God hides us in His shelter and goes with us and is our shelter . He hides us in the palms of His hands , covered there by His love.What can one say other then to just be overawed by this amazingly beautiful album . I look forward to purchasing more of their albums . They are a must for all lovers of Christian music .
 I got hooked on Watermark because of `` Gloria '' which still brings me to tears . Having lived in there , I can both laugh at and understand `` Welcome to Delaware '' which as a matter of fact describes God 's promise to me while I was at the University of Delaware . While not in the same upbeat manner as most praise & worship , this is still a wonderfully spiritual album .
 Christy and Nathan are truly blessed by the hand of God ... I saw them with Point Of Grace and they rocked the house down !!! They are the most awesome duo Ive heard in years ... Im in my 30 's and loved them as much as any one Ive ever heard before . . The young and old were on their feet praising the Lord when Christy was singing . . After the show I saw her and she is as real as real can get ... She gave me a hug and I told her she was truly a voice of the Lord ... Praise be to our Lord for Christy and Nathan -LRB- Watermark -RRB- ... As Chrsity says , we are the Watermark of Christ !!!!! Glory to God !!!!!
 This CD is incredible . You ca n't help but want to worship the wonderful God we serve when you listen to it . In a bad mood ? Pop it in and it 'll lift your spirit ! In a good mood ? Pop it in and you 'll be soaring!Christy 's voice is AWESOME and the musical talent of Nathan is INCREDIBLE ! This is one you 'll be listening to for a long time and will be looking forward to the next release . They 're EXCEPTIONAL !!!
 I just have to say that I went out an purchased Watermark 's debut cd and it is one of the best debuts in the last 10 years of Christian music.Lyrically , it 's worshipful , convicting , insightful and challenging.Muscially it 's just FABULOUS . Lush accoustics with a good beat . Christy Nockels is THE BOMB -LRB- that was a compliment for those of you who are over 30 -RRB- She sounds like a cross between Christine Dente and Susan Ashton . But she has her own style and it 's good ... it 's REALLY GOOD!They are gon na make a HUGE splash in Christian music.Here 's a side note
 I am so thankful I purchased this CD . I had only heard one song from it on the radio and decided I wanted to hear more from this couple . They did an excellent job of pouring spiritual insight into their songs . I could n't wait to learn the songs so I could could sing along with them ... in my car ... alone . I ca n't imagine anyone being disappointed with this selection .
 Very talented and very inspiring music . Great show in Chico
 This couple is definitly glorifing God . The cd is FIVE STAR
 This is my all time favorite album ! `` Gloria '' and `` Peace '' being my two favorites .
 I just loved listening to Watermak . When I first heard them on the radio . I am now going to write an essay about their music for my college class !!
 Whenever I need to escape from the world for a couple moments , I simply listen to Watermark . `` Take Me There '' has revived my sanity on numerous occassions . Not only do the songs refresh me , but they also challenge me . An odd combination but it works . I look forward to seeing more of these guys .
 I truly love this group because of what it stands for and the unity between the two of them . I truly hope that one day I will have a marriage just like theirs . I truly admire them and wish them all the luck . I saw them in concert with Point Of Grace on April 2 , 1999 and the whole thing was wonderful . May God bless them and the people like me who they will and have touched in a special way.Thanks , Nicole D. Clark Columbia , South Carolina
 Writing all their own songs , this duo has a pop sound and words that truly convey answers to a persons search for `` Peace '' , even in `` Delaware '' , because you can hear of Gods `` Renown '' , ... wishing you could praise him as in `` Gloria '' like the turning of the leaves or or rolling of the thunder . Even in the singable , 50 's sound of `` Everything '' a simple but powerful message of commitment . Wow ! these guys can write !
 I got to see Watermark just last night in concert . They have a style which would appeal to just about anybody ! Their music is soothing and inspiring , and Christy 's voice is incredible . She makes it look so easy ! If you 're into mellow yet contemporary , this album is a must .

 This is incredible music . 5 of these songs are playing on the comtemporary Christian radio stations . The rest are great too . A delightful mixture of bouncy & fun and slow & deep songs that feed my soul . Invigorating , inspiring & healing ... what more could you ask ?
 This CD is filled with great songs . It is rare to not have a ` meh ' song and this does n't , they are all sing along loud songs
 I just heart this album for the first time , and it 's the first I 've heard of this group also . I can tell you this ; I 'm going to rush out right now and buy everything this group has ever recorded . I 'm that impressed . I 'm a big Out of the Grey fan , and Watermark reminds me a lot of OOG . Christy Nockles has one of the most incredible , passionate voices I have ever heard in Contemporary Christian Music . I have n't been this excited about a Contemporary Christian Artist in many years . Especially impressed with `` Take Me There '' , `` Welcome to Delaware '' and `` Calm the Waters '' , but there is not a throwaway song on the entire album . Breathtakingly beautiful . If you like Out of the Grey or similar music , buy this album as soon as humanly possible
 Saw them this past weekend in Chicago . Christy not only has an awesome voice but is also an awesome person . When listening to the CD in the car on the way home , I was struck that her voice was more incredible in person than on the CD . Definitely buy the disc and absolutely see them in concert if you have the chance .
 SAW THEM LAST NIGHT IN CONCERT THEY WERE GREAT . THEY LEFT THERE WATERMARK ON ME WISH THEM ALL THE LUCK MAY GOD BE WITH THEM
 Do you like classic music ? or just only Rock ? In the childhood , i like sounds of rain , wind , something natuer note.Now I think it 's rythm !! Someone say , Music start from rythm , and Someone say it start from melody . Both feeling is right , i think . This Sarabande , i search for 20 yaers . At young days , i know from a some percussionist . She was a good musician . -LRB- Also She play the acoustic bass and recorder -RRB- In the Dream at night , i have heared manytime this tune . It 's nostalgy , bare , and primitive -LRB- = pure -RRB- , passion . All of i want are in this Saraband .
 Warning
 I found Deep Purple in 1974 at the Lewisham Odeon in London . It was a moment that changed my musical outlook . I saw Jon Lord with Tony Ashton doing the big band thing and when `` Windows '' came out I readily snapped it up . 30 + years later , it still confuses me.When `` Sarabande '' came out , it fair knocked me over . This is a brilliantly realised interpretation of a baroque dance suite , from the genteel `` Aria '' to the almost dervish-like `` Gigue . `` For me , everything about this album is understated and that is its strength . It is simple ; it is accessible and you do n't have to know a darned thing about baroque . It jazzes , it swings , it rocks . It is as far removed from Purple as day is from night and I still listen to it with the same awe and wonder as I did then.Jon Lord has said that it is his best work . Or he has n't , depending on what you read . I also keep seeing the word `` masterpiece '' in other reviews . I can speak for neither of these but I will say that `` Sarabande '' is among the greatest albums I have . It is a work that reaches true heights ; it is a work that endures and I think that that 's because , freed from the distractions of Deep Purple , he got it right this time . `` Sarabande '' is impeccable.Oh , and for you music lovers , somewhere around 1977 I saw the `` Sarabande '' gig at the Albert Hall , complete with deliberate bum notes and Pete York sight-reading a drum solo , supporting David Bedford 's `` The Odyssey '' which featured a very shy and reclusive musical genius by the name of Mike Oldfield on guitar .
 After trying and mostly failing with the nevertheless entertaining `` Concerto for Group & Orchestra '' and `` Gemini Suite '' , Lord finally succeeds in fusing rock band and orchestra . This is a very good album . The songs are well written and well played . -LRB- I dare say this album contains Andy Summers ' finest guitar work . -RRB- In places it is reminiscent of early King Crimson , but with more melodic sense . It may also remind you of Rick Wakeman 's similar efforts in the early 70 's , but `` Sarabande '' is much more tasteful . Highly recommended for Deep Purple fans and for the curious . The open-minded will not be disappointed .
 Mr John Lord is 60 today , this album was recorded in M&uuml;nich west Germany , when he did in 1975 along with the classical german conductor Mr. Eberhard Schoener . The musical style was influenced by the Baroque suite dance of the 16th century . The Inspiration of Johann Sebastian Bach Jon Lord had used in this suite orchestra , was amazing.Jon Lord shows the music fans -LRB- but not only for deep purple fans -RRB- that his love for classical music convinced the fans of his strong piano or keyboard playing capability . The result is fantastic !
 I bought the LP for the first time 30 years ago . A wonderful masterpiece if you like classical music with a `` rock touch '' . I really do n't know if Jon Lord wrote some other pieces , but I really love this one !
 I have had this album , yes the hard vynl thing , since 1981 . Now we can get these great works of art right on our pcs . My favorite as always been Bouree . I think this is one of the neatest pieces ever written . I love the images it invokes . Strap those head phones on and be transported into the romance of dancers in veils and moonlit desert nights .
 I first heard Sarabande when i picked it up upon original vinyl release , and it quickly became one of my favorite musical works of all time . Jon expertly intertwines Jazz , Rock and Classical , as the music of his piece flows from one section to the next . The orchestration is expertly handled and Mssr Lord 's own playing is top notch . Add the guitar work of a pre-Police Andy Summers and this is one for repeated listening . Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys finely crafted music .
 Excellent music if you like Piano/Organ . John Lord is incredible in this Great CD.I have been listening to it every day in the past two weeks . I ca n't get enough !!!!
 This is an excellent album by a Master Musician of the B3 organ.It is the stepping out of the Deep Purple progressive rock group into pure Classical Music
 Produced by David T. Clydesdale , this project finds Dino bringing his inimitable style and flair to a program of classic chestnuts with emotive themes and lush orchestrations .
 I do n't know why Amazon.Com gave this album such a negative review . All the songs kick lots of a ** , especially the Propellerheads ' , the most underrated band in existence . Granted , it may not be the best for parties . It might not have the dance-able beats . But , sh ** , who cares ? And what 's wrong with Gap commercials ?
 Yes , a terribly obvious collection of songs , and I pretty much program out Fatboy Slim -LRB- and the awful title track -RRB- when I play this CD . But the pacing and selection of the remaining songs are better than most comps , with Lo-Fidelity , Prodigy , Orb , Chem Bros , Crystal Method and Propellerheads all flowing together nicely . I prefer this to the other compilations with which this overlaps heavily , like MTV 's Amp2 . Nothing earthshattering , but decent and very danceable .
 Ever since living in Germany for a year , the world of electronica has opened its gates to me -- I like other types of music too , but my true passion has become finding new beats from new artists . This CD , when it comes out , will be a great introduction to the music that some of us had to really search for . Here it is -- IN YOUR FACE !!! You 'd be a fool not to take this CD and save yourself all the effort of finding these artists on your own . And P.S. , buy Fatboy Slim 's `` We 've Come A Long Way , Baby '' Album -- a must have for parties or cruising on the highway !
 Although I hav n't listened to the full CD , seeing as it has n't been released yet , I have heard most of the tracks and I can tell it 's gon na be a great compilation . I 've been waiting for the chem . brothers , Fatboy Slim , Bjork , and the Lo-Fi allstars to get together for a long time . Peace out !
 Pretty much the greatest new wave outer space Scottish monster goofball pop combo of all time , and this 1978 Sire release is their debut , swan song and masterpiece . Vocalists Faye Fife and Eugene Patterson were magnificent postmodern creations , hyperkinetic comic book kids made flesh , while the band laid down spastic rhythms on delicious confections like `` Top of the Pops '' and `` I Ca n't Stand My Baby . '' What used to be called side two lags a smidge , but the hit to miss ratio leans heavily to hit . It 's all silly yet strangely menacing-with the album 's final grunted line making it clear that these spacepups are not to be trifled with . -LRB- review from Scram Magazine # 22 -RRB-
 I saw the Rezillos both in Cal . and in London ... god if only they still make music like this . They have great lyrics , beat and easy to pogo to ! Not one sucky song and leaves you breathless for more !!! Hi-energy classic punk with a fun sense ... I love my baby cuz she does good sculptures , yeah ! GET THIS CD AND YOU WILL BE VERRRRRY HAPPY !!! -LRB- old enough to remember them live -RRB-
 This is the business , the Rezillos debut on 180 gram vinyl reminds me of a time when rock was going to save the world . The -LRB- ir -RRB- reverent covers are a blast but it 's the originals and the sound of the band that makes this thing cook . I have the CD The Almost Complete Rezillos which has all the tracks on this album but this is the 180 gram Vinyl issue and as you would expect it blows the CD out of the water . The drums , bass and clarity of sound are streets ahead of the CD version and will not only remind everyone of a time that rock 'n' roll could save the world but have will have you believing there 's still a chance of it happening . One of the greatest rock 'n' roll records ever made .
 This is what country music is supposed to sound like.It 's tempting to write about the obvious influences that permeate this recording -- George Jones , Ray Price , Lefty Frizzell , Merle Haggard , Hank Sr. , the men who were at once pioneers and hitmakers in the country field before Chet Atkins and the `` Nashville Sound '' turned most of country music into unidentifiable sludge . And that 's just on the performance end -- the original songs bring to mind Harlan Howard , Hank Garland , Bill Anderson , Townes Van Zandt.But to fixate on these influences would be , I think , to overlook the fact that this is a fresh , enthusiastic , emotionally true record that just about anyone who appreciates good music can enjoy . This is music played with real love and passion , crafted not as a museum piece but as something to be enjoyed and danced to and sung along with.When the CD kicks off with `` Living On The Road Again , '' I defy you to not tap your foot along with it . The stripped-down sound of the Long Gone Daddies suits the material perfectly -- no string sections , no overbearing background choruses , no keyboards , just guitar , drums , and feeling . Arty sings songs like `` Driftin ' In '' and `` Back On The Rail '' with great emotion and really sell that drowning-my-sorrows vibe ; `` It Ai n't Workin ' '' and `` Jackson Shake '' have a good hard-driving sound that 's custom made to get everyone in the bar dancing.This is a great honky-tonk record . I am withholding one star only because I want to hear what their next CD sounds like . Buy it .
 WOW ! If you are looking for a home grown good time ... check out this CD.My foot was immediately set to tapping once the CD started ... and yours will be too on jumping country songs like
 Having recently bought and loved Arty Hill and the Long Gone Daddys ' CD BAR OF GOLD , I bought BACK ON THE RAIL , and it 's also terrific . BACK ON THE RAIL is much the same kind of honky tonk CD as BAR OF GOLD and features great rock and roll -LRB- `` Jackson Shake '' , `` It Ai n't Working '' , `` Big Daddy 's Rye '' -RRB- , two wonderful shuffles -LRB- `` Me and My Glass Jaw '' , `` Drifting In '' -RRB- , and basic crying country , the best of which is `` Back on the Rail '' . In addition this CD has two very nice folk songs , `` I Left Highlandtown '' -LRB- which is really folk in sound only - the lyrics are pure country -RRB- and the beautiful `` Tammerlane '' . As on BAR OF GOLD , the songs are so honest , so personal , so imaginative - so good - that they will appeal to anyone with a taste for this type of music . The playing is very good , though I like it a little better on BAR OF GOLD due to Jack O'Dell 's drumming , and even more so , to the fact that Arty Hill is the lead guitar on that one . The lead on BACK ON THE RAIL , Dave Chappell , is certainly good , but I just prefer Hill 's playing and taste . Hill 's singing is also very good and it fits perfectly with his songs.I like the BAR OF GOLD CD slightly better than BACK ON THE RAIL , but only by a small margin . This CD is outstanding and I highly recommend it.As a consumer note , there are 2008 and 2009 versions of BACK ON THE RAIL and the only difference I can see is that the 2009 CD contains an extra song , `` When the Sparks Come Falling Down '' .
 Arty just keeps getting better . In a time of over-produced synthetic watered down pop filled muck some folks call country , he 's the real deal . Probably born a generation too late.Many CD 's are filled with ... well - filler tunes . Back on The Rail is right on the money .
 Arty Hill and the Long Gone Daddys deftly demonstrate how good roots music can be when it is done simply . Aided in no small part by electric guitarist Dave Chappell and drummer Craig Stevens , Hill crafted a 12-song set of original songs - he wrote 11 of them - that express authentic country heartache and hard-drinkin ' good times with modern leaning lyrics and ` 60s country rhythms.The rest of the review is at the Country Standard Time web site
 I originally bought this album because I was going to see Matt in concert & wanted to know what I was in for . I was surprised to find the album was truly pure country - not the pop version of what radio thinks country should be . I was further hooked when I got to meet Matt after the concert . He is one of the truest people I have ever met . He writes about what he knows & is n't ashamed to admit he 's made mistakes . It floored me to learn that he had been told he was `` too country '' for country radio . A pity . It 's hard to find that lilting twang in the vocals & that soul-piercing cry of the fiddle & steel guitar on the radio . If you like classic country , you will love this album .
 This is the second album of Matt King 's I have purchased . The first album `` Five O'clock Hero '' was awesome and his new album `` Hard Country '' has proven to be even better in my opinion . There is a variety in the selections that show off Matt 's versatility as a musician and performer . I highly reccomend this album and hope you enjoy it as much as I have .
 I ca n't stop listening to this CD . It is the best music that I 've heard since Vince Gill 's `` The Key '' . Every song is good enough to be released as a single , although most of the `` country music '' stations probably wo n't bother . Please give `` Hard Country '' a listen . You wo n't regret it .
 When a new artist comes along , they have to have a certain sound to make it big . They have to be able to jump out and make a name for themselves . For the past 5 years , Nashville has been churning out some pathetic excuses for country acts . Examples ... David Kersh , Bryan White , Shania Twain , Joe Dee Messina Warren Brothers , Chris Cummings , and Lonestar . These acts have brought a POP-sound into `` COUNTRY '' music , and I think it 's a disgrace . For the longest time , I thought that it would n't get better . That `` traditional country '' was a thing of the past ... an urban legend , some would say !!! Then , in July of 1997 , I was given a CD . It was called `` FIVE O'CLOCK HERO '' . The artists ' name was MATT KING . The CD had no insert ... no liner notes ... not even a picure . Just a CD and a case . Later that day , I put it into my pickup , and fell in love . For weeks , it stayed in my truck 's CD player . I played it for some clients , and they loved it . My friends loved it !!!! Even my family loved it !!!!! To our dismay , radio stations would n't play Matt King . When asked why , they would respond ... `` he does n't fit our style of `` country '' . My question is this
 Sainte Colombe was forgotten for centuries and rebirth by A. Cormeau movie `` tous les matins du monde '' . It is a music for relaxation with a lot of emotion . Jordi Saval is one of the best cello player in the word . This CD must be in every serious music collection .
 Achilles is from my home town Rochester and ive had the privelage to see them many of times . Their music is amazing . If you have n't heard this album along with their last , you 're missing out . Engineer is awesome as well . But check out Achilles . : -RRB-
 its the best music i have heard in some time . if you are in to world music or just looking for some thing diferent , well it does not get much better then this .
 It is difficult to believe that any event could be as beautiful as this coming together of Beethoven , Oistrakh , and Gui with the Milan Symphony Orchestra on April 5th , 1960 . Yet , here you have it
 Possibly the greatest of all violin concertos played by the all-time great violinist David Oistrakh at the height of his powers -- a live performance with the Milan Symphony conducted by Vitorio Rai 5 April 1960 . Play this record LOUD . The notes fairly fly off Oistrakh 's violin . The energy is enormous . Rejoice that youare fortunate enough to have a copy of this wondrous event .
 Now what the hell is this ? As of 17 November of 2004 only 12 reviews have been written for this album ? The greatest hits for Peter Tosh . Now granted people will make arguments for songs they thought should or should n't of been included , but only 12 reviews for one of the most talented men ever in raggae ? Great album , Peter had his own style and stuck to his convictions . Such drive was never truely rewarded while he was alive , only like so many great artists -LRB- not just music -RRB- was he recognized for his wonderful talent . I highly recommend this album to new comers to raggae and Peter Tosh . One love
 Every track on here is awesome --
 While reggae icon Bob Marley 's music continues to be popular throughout the world , his former Wailer bandmate Peter Tosh 's music has been largely ignored , particularly in America . Scrolls of the Prophet is a solid collection of his best work from his '70s albums and although his recording career was n't as strong or as prolific as Marley 's , this compilation shows he was a stellar songwriter in his own right.There are some outstanding reggae tracks here with the best being the angry `` Stepping Razor '' , the pro-marijuana track `` Legalize It '' , the very political tracks `` Equal Rights '' and `` African '' , and perhaps his most popular track `` Downpresser Man . '' The album opening version of `` Get Up , Stand Up '' is very good , featuring a more powerful vocal performance than Marley 's version . The introspective ballad `` Fools Die '' is the best track here , featuring his passionate vocals and its moody flute line . The duet with Mick Jagger , '' -LRB- You Got ta Walk And -RRB- Do n't Look Back '' , is also a strong track . Some of the tracks do have a sameness to them with many of them beginning with a similar drum intro . The laid-back reggae of tracks like `` Ketchy Shuby '' and `` Till Your Well Runs Dry '' are decent , but not as strong as the tracks that compose the album 's first half . A solid compilation . He also has another best-of collection called Dread Do n't Die which contains his best tracks from his '80s albums and some live tracks which is also very good . Fans of Bob Marley and casual fans of reggae should check this out .
 Pure hardcore party vibes here , . . with infectuous spirits that can intoxicate . Rockin ' tunes include `` Legalize it '' ' `` Downpressor Man '' and a fantastic `` Get Up , Stand Up . '' Hard and fat bass lines , solid drumming and vocal chants work to induce a tribal fever and a mood to celebrate life .
 In the pantheon of reggae , as I see it , there is Peter Tosh , and there is everyone else , Bob Marley included.Tosh wrote or co-wrote several of the original Wailers ' most potent songs , including `` Get Up Stand Up , '' `` 400 Years , '' `` Stop That Train , '' and `` One Foundation , '' as well as the classic rude boy anthem `` I 'm the Toughest . '' Tosh 's mix of fiery social commentary with solid Rastafarian beliefs made him a hero to many , and as the fortunes of the Wailers rose , so should have Peter 's ... Fate intervened , however , and Bob was chosen as the `` leader '' of the group as they marched towards international fame reportedly due to his lighter skin tone as opposed to Peter 's very dark ebony . Tosh and Bunny Wailer both saw no alternative but to leave the group.Tosh 's solo efforts , such as the classic lp 's `` Legalize It '' and `` Equal Rights '' made him fans the world over and enemies at home . The brutality that Tosh suffered and put up with in Jamaica , including several near death beatings in prisons , only served to solidify both Tosh 's standing in the communities he preached to , as well as his anti-government rhetoric.This compilation shows well the power that Tosh possessed in his short life , and his razor sharp delivery of the messages he so believed in.Much of this collection are from his `` Legalize It '' and `` Equal Rights '' lps , and both lps are must haves in any reggae fan 's collection.An amazing collection showcasing reggae 's true Bush Doctor . As Tosh himself said , `` I am a stepping razor , do n't u judge my size , I 'm DANGEROUS ! `` Indeed you were , Peter . Jah be praised .
 As a long time happy amazon customer it was natural to try their instant music and video products . I have been impressed with both . This album is nice , has some great tunes , ' 400 years ' is the reason I got it , but the rest are nice as well . The amazon cloud player is super versatile .
 I 've always loved reggae music for the good vibes and political/social statements it makes . Peter Tosh fills this disc from songs about equal rights , praising Jah , and marijuana . Definitely good reggae .
 This CD makes me wish I had taken the time to travel to wherever he appeared in concert during his tragically short lifetime . Equal Rights is his benchmark song ; that track and Ketchy Shuby demonstrate his great range of intensity .
 I 'm not a fan of every song but it has a few essentials like `` Legalize it '' , `` Stepping Razor '' and `` Igziabeher -LRB- Let Jah Be Praised '' . It is reggae , so its manitory to put the phones on , roll one , and melt away !
 While I 've been listening to all kinds of music my whole life , I find Peter Tosh to be more of a REAL representation of the struggle of the Rasta man than his fellow bandmate Bob Marley . Bob 's music is great , but lost some of it 's grass roots meanings the more popular it got . Peter Tosh seems to be more consistant in his beliefs and songs than any other singer I 've heard.I give this album -LRB- and all the other Peter Tosh albums I own -RRB- 5 stars simply out of respect for his life and his never ending struggle to keep it real .
 This is a great mix of some of the best tunes Peter Tosh wrote and sang . The world of Reggae hears more about Bob Marley , but Peter Tosh is definately one of the godfathers of reggae , just as much as brother Bob . Get this disc and enjoy !
 This , along with The Best Of Peter Tosh
 While Bob Marley is my hero , and in my opinion , the king of reggae , Peter Tosh is my second and a man that I greatly admire . I also believe that Peter Tosh is grossly underrated and remains in Bob Marley 's shadow even in death.I bought this compilation a little over a year ago and have since bought all of his orignal albums and then some , but I still say it is the equivelent of Bob Marley 's `` Legend '' for Peter Tosh . Scrolls of the Prophet has nearly every hit from Peter Tosh 's career including `` Legalize It , '' `` Get Up , Stand Up , '' `` Downpresser Man , '' `` Stepping Razor , '' and his groundbreaking duet with Mick Jagger '' -LRB- You Got ta Walk -RRB- Do n't Look Back '' from 1978 . While the Coxscone Dodd-produced version of `` One Love '' from 1965 with the Wailers is an odd choice for one of Tosh 's ` greatest hits , ' it certainly is n't a bad one . Buy this album , enjoy it , and get to know the Bush Doctor .
 when I want to hear reggae music , I have always preferred to listen to the older , `` original '' reggae stars , Bob Marley , Jimmy Cliff , Desmond Decker , and , of course , Peter Tosh . This is a good compilation of his work and a good way to get introduced to his music . While he never approached the fame or influence of Bob Marley , his music holds its own and is great to listen to .
 I know that most music fans get their introduction to reggae music from the great Bob Marley . If you already have plenty of Marley in your cd collection and want to add some more reggae , I highly recommend this cd as the next step . The cd has some real reggae gems on it , `` Legalize It '' and `` Equal Rights '' are two of my favorites , but they are all solid .
 Peter Tosh was one of the Greatest Reggae song writers and performers of his time . Unfortunately , despite the fact that they were colaborators and friends , his success is overshadowed by the equally beautiful Bob Marley . Peter Tosh , who co-wrote and co-performed the song `` Get Up , Stand Up '' with Mr. Marley , wrote music and lyrics with such astounding beauty and deeply personal meaning that they can bring tears to your eyes . Where as Bob Marley was a poet and a prophet , Peter Tosh was the truth-teller and the sooth-seer -LRB- sp ? -RRB- . His work is often darker , and the subject matter more controversial than Bob Marley , but he was equally brilliant . This collection is incredible , and I highly suggest to any fan of Bob Marley , reggae , or ska .
 `` Scrolls of the Prophet '' is the Best of Peter Tosh . This is really all that you need if you are a normal fan or are interested in Tosh . It is a good intro to his career . You get all of his biggest hits on his Columbia recordings . You 'll probably want to purchase more of his individual albums after hearing this CD though.It 's a nice next logical step for anyone who has Bob Marley 's `` Legend '' . If you only know reggae as Bob Marley , this is a good second CD to pick up . I prefer Tosh over Bunny Wailer . This CD starts out basically where Bob Marley left off . Highly recommended for the ridiculously cheap price of $ 8 .
 My fiance introduced me to reggae music a couple of years ago . Before that , I was relatively unfamiliar . In his song `` Fools Die '' , Peter Tosh has spoken to me on a base level of humanity . He was a spiritual feeler of our souls . Not only did he have an incredible voice , but what he spoke really touches my most sacred place . I rank him as one of the most incredible writers and singers of our time . I am sorry for his loss in our world .
 THE MAN IS A PROPHET . Anyone who loves reggae will love this album
 Was turned on to this by a Ry fan and really enjoyed it . Great party music that will keep things moving . Recomended for those who like New Orleans dance music with a little Ry slide thrown in .
 This is an incredible documentary about an amazing man . The film takes you on a ride through the histroy of jazz while telling the story of the phenomonal genius and versatility of Quincy Jones .

 QUINCY JONES IS ALWAYS OUT OF CROWN HE IS VERY GREAT TOUCHING PERFECT PRODUCING SHOW YOU EVERY SINGLE LITTLE DETAIL IN THE RECORED I SLAUT HIM AND RESPECT HIS MAGICAL WORK
 Just finished watching it and I never ever stop being amazed of the music history and legiends he has worked with . Sad to know the people in that movie of the legends who speak highly of him , including MJ are no longer here ... I also liked how he kept it real about his relationships and marriages and personal & mental health impacted his career .
 The cool cat with nine lives is music legend Quincy Jones.From humble beginnings on rough streets to icon status on Fifty-Second Street , Jones takes us back to the beginning and SHOWS us -LRB- does n't just TELL us -RRB- his life story in this lush , musical and incredibly creative documentary . Flmmaker Ellen Wiesbrod gets so close to Quincy Jones , capturing so many moods and rememberances , that you can almost hear him think and breathe and grieve . Like great jazz , the film itself jumps with raw energy . One of the most creative pieces of moviemaking I 've watched in a long time -- and it 's a decade old ! Well worth digging up the VHS player to experience . Five stars .
 This is enlightening to anyone who 's ever been a fan or can appreciate the music of Michael Jackson , The Brothers Johnson , Chaka Chan , Ray Charles , Frank Sinatra , or Dinah Washington . Quincy transcends musical excellence and in this film , it gives some insight into how the man became the man he is ; and , also some musical insight into what brought him there .
 quincy jones is music period.this film showcases the many diffrent artists that he has worked with.it 's a true tribute to one of the masters of music.from miles davis to michael jackson , frank sinitra etcc . . the best pay tribute to the best .

 Clair Marlo has the most incredible voice you can imagine and her material is absolutely magic to the ears . I have listened to this album for the past 5 years I think and never tire of it . It is a shame that she only seems to release her music every 5 years or so , as I have waited with great anticipation for her next release ever since I heard the last one . Great songs from the heart and wonderful musicians on every cut . Dunno why it is listed as an import as she lives and works in LA. . . ? Do yourself a favor and get a copy of this album !
 Clair Marlo 's Behaviour Self is a collection of warm , well done songs . The quality of the recording makes it feel that she is giving a personal performance in the same room . This is not to say that her music is the standard `` coffee club performer with a guitar . '' Her music takes you to many different places . You stroll through the French countryside with the accordion laden `` To Close , '' and you feel like you are in the midst of a gospel choir in `` Break the Chain . '' If you are looking for a quaint , light and relaxing set of music , Behaviour Self is not a bad choice .
 Amazing mix of deep , plush , female house music and Kate Bush/Mylene Farmer Euro dream music in which `` the orgasm as both subject matter and musical form '' -LRB- as critic Vince Aletti once wrote about disco -RRB- gets transported to booty-licious Parisian stratospheres ... you might also want to discover this song in an even more tasty shape in DJ Pete Tong 's ESSENTIAL MIX cd -LRB- ffrr -RRB- ...
 Totally addictive , engrossing groove track . It floats around , looping back in , casting a net that seduces and embraces.Not a heavy dance track , a good pop sensability . Dreamlike , but real and associative . Vaguely familiar , but exotic at the same time.Frequently played on Triple J , national youth broadcaster in Australia . Lots of people always wanting to know who Jakatta is .

 This is an amazing track ; sensual , groovy , hypnotic . Using samples from American Beauty , this track will take you somewhere well away from chaos and the mundane -LRB- see the film clip -RRB- and you 've got ta love that .
 This is a good collection of songs performed by Roy Ayers/Roy Ayers Ubiquity circa 1975-1983 . For what you get the pricing is fair . If you are unfamiliar with Roy Ayers/Roy Ayers Ubiquity , this is a good place for you to start . For this collection , the pricing is fair , since the man put out a fairly large volume sum of work !! Four stars !!
 This album has 12 old and beloved hymns . They are played so pleasantly , yet not errevently . I would love to have every album that Jim Hendricks makes .
 This album has a wonderful selection of old-fashioned hymns that we know and love . The music is so pleasant without being irreverent . I 'm so happy to have this album .
 This is some of the best Surf music in my collection . In California , 20 years before this album was made , I went to the concerts to see some of these same musicians and bands perform `` live '' -LRB- and they still do ! -RRB- . It brings back great memories to play this album , even though the music is new . Legends , such as Randy Stonehill , Chuck Girard and Phil Keaggy , join relatively recent great groups , such as Smalltown Poets , All Star United and PlankEye , for this amazing compilation album . This is for anyone who appreciates The Ventures ' era guitars , or wants to hum along with the strong , well written , melodies . The mix of an older , alternative-rock band as LOST DOGS , with newcomer RICH YOUNG RULER on the song THE NET , creates great depth in the musical score and background vocals . Daniel Amos still harmonize their vocals as good as ever , and make you tap your foot ... Those guys never grow old ! CAUTION

 I purchased this CD for my son who loves the Beach Boys and we both have really enjoyed it . To me it 's the Beach Boys meets Christian Contemporary !
 For anyone who has ever wanted to punch a wall , this is the song for you . To this day , when someone gives me a nasty look for no reason , I say , `` Like I 'm the one who got your daughter strung out on crack !? '' LOL !
 Question ... . how come is it everytime I go to the mall , i 'm getting chased by 20 chics wanting to go out on a date with me ? I mean really , am I that good looking ??? yes I am , but FUNK DAT !!! See what I did there ? I took the line from the song and plugged it in my everyday life , I 'm very clever . This song really revolutionized the way I live . If I 'm at the gas station I 'll start a riot by standing on the hood of my car and saying `` QUESTION
 This song was the bomb back in the day ! I still think of it often when I turn on the radio and the same crap is playing over and over and over again and I think to myself , `` Why is it that every time I turn on the radio , I hear the same 5 songs , 15 times a day for 3 months - MAN , FUNK DAT ! Get a new DJ ! ''
 My favourite lyric is perfect for all the beggars I encounter all the time when I 'm back home on holidays . -LRB- I work in Mongolia a lot -RRB- and I just love to say to them
 Noise music 's most ardent animal welfare activists returns in top form with a very eclectic and refined CD . Some of the songs and sounds are blistering and provocative . Others are actually mellow and soothing . If played at volume level 4 out of 10 , this is a very enjoyable CD for the ears , the mind and the soul . Yes it was recorded in his Tokyo Bedroom like all the other classics . Merzbow and Merzbird should be played together in a live format .
 All my old time favorites with beautiful variety of instruments . Love to listen to this any time & any where !
 After owning this piece for six years now , it 's still one of my faves . When it 's on in the car someone will invariably ask , `` who is this ? '' followed by some rave review . `` Still in this thing '' is one of the best . What has happened to the Boomers ?
 This is one of my all-time favorite CDs ... . check out the lyrics , Ian Thomas 's vocals , the great band , the overall pacing of song selection and order ... . holds up great upon multiple listenings -LRB- trust me on that , I speak from experience ! -RRB- . And if you saw Bette Midler 's HBO special , she did a great cover of `` To Comfort You . '' Why do n't more people know about this group ? And what the heck are they up to these days ? Grab yourself a copy of `` The Art of Living '' -- you 'll be so glad you did !!!
 10 years ago I was listening to a local `` offbeat '' radio station which has since fell by the wayside . It was a nice retreat from the typical `` Rock '' cookies cutter stations in my area . If I heard Zepplin , The Stones , or some other worn out over played artists I would slit my wrists . It was here on the small low powered station that I first came across The Boomers . The station did n't say who the artist were , so I looked up the stations number and called . The voice at the other end informed me that The Boomers was a band out of Canada . The cut I heard was the title song `` Art of Living '' . I like it so much I started calling the local records store to buy a copy of this album . I was informed that it was not available in the U.S. . So I drove up to Toronto to obtain a copy . It was a three hour drive but well worth it . On my trip back I played the CD and it was a very cool ride back . Titles such as Modern Man and others were moving and insightful . A few years later that album and some others were stolen from my car . So I made another trip to replace it . To sum it up one of my all time favorite albums . Thank God for those `` offbeat '' small stations .
 This album never gets old . Of all the tunes on my frequent players list , it ages the least.Amazing studio work , smart and funny lyrics from a very experienced and talented group.Too bad they are in retirement . I 'd love to hear more .
 May be I 'm the only one in whole Moscow to have this CD since I 've bought it in 1995 somewhere in Switzerland . It was 18 months later than I heard it for the first time at a friend in Germany . I liked it so much that I really searched through all music shops on my way to find a copy . It took me a year and a half to meet my crazy desire . About the disc
 The recently-deceased Earle Brown was one-quarter of the four composers dubbed ` The New York School ' back in the 1950s . John Cage , Morton Feldman , and Christian Wolff -LRB- the only surviving member -RRB- have had higher profiles what with the compositions of Cage and Feldman being extremely well documented and Wolff recently recording with Sonic Youth and the John Zorn ` Downtown ' crowd -LRB- check out the `` Burdocks '' CD on Tzadik for the results -RRB- . Brown was one of the first composers - if not the first - to use graphic notation , a method by which the musical score consists of graphs , diagrams , pie charts or whatever to convey to the musician what sounds they should be producing -LRB- ie
 Second time around Naple 's wonderland . Mina sings with her heart bleeding through her voice . Breathtaking orchestration and arrangements for these italian classics -LRB- just like american standards like summertime , the man I love , cry me a river etc. -RRB- . Her voice rises as usual and it seems she is what she sings . This purly dramatic cd will ensure you a special unforgettable listening . A must have . A masterpiece .
 Mina 's second tribute to the wonderful Napolitan musical treasure is truly a masterpiece . THE singer of Italy adds a jazzy class to these famous beautiful songs.Everybody knows ' O SOLE MIO , but NOT like this ! Mina lifts this popular song up into the perfect -LRB- jazz -RRB- ballad for dancing lovers!Track 2 has a wonderful groove . Track 5 introduces and combines a children 's choir and rocky electric guitars . `` I ' te vurria vasa ' ! '' is absolutely breathtaking , and shows definitely a mature and sublime singer.Most of this music is highly passionate.I played this album in the background of an art exhibition , because of the great ATMOSPHERE it has . It suited well -LRB- and made people curious ! -RRB- , simply cos art fits art!I could n't agree more with another Amazon user
 Mina is always Mina , she never fails to deliver wonderful songs and ability to sing in any language . This Cd is a must have .
 I 'm familiar with most of these songs , but how Mina sings them is unique ; rich with the passion of a master vocalist , interpreter . Mina embraces the listener with the female 's heart 's vibrations . Empowering and encouraging . Mille grazie a tutti ch ` an creato questo compilation .
 I had a lot of trouble finding this C D. I look over the internet for couple of hours until I came upon Amazon . Not only did I find what I was looking for , but bought the C D for a price I did not think could possible . Thanks ! Love this Awesome C D.
 Massive terror from these Swedish lads , intensive Black/Death Metal in the vein of Dissection and with a very recommendable production , clear and representative , from Sunlight Studios -LRB- same place used by Entombed , Dismember , etc -RRB- . Code 666 surely has an eagle eye to catch nowadays most potential bands ; Bloodshed is no exception , this tremendous quintet play vigorous rhythms mostly composed of sweeping riffs which move from broad mid-paste intervals through a melodic bridge to binary variation & tremble movements on the chords . The melodies tend to slop more or less like a rock n ' roll band yet in an inverted manner ; sometimes complex and exquisite leads , other parts fluid power-chords . The various tempo alterations move from permutations of central riffs -LRB- mostly up/down patterns of motion -RRB- while keeping an ear for melody and the harmonic sublime . The embedded elements of Black Metal are retained in an aural formula , mostly aesthetic I would dare say , leaving the traditional Death Metal structures ala Hypocrisy -LRB- early stage -RRB- take leadership.The vocal curses are rasping and sudden , pushing the listener against the wall and forcing to swallow the lyrics without option . Actually , the entire album is very much energetic and downright fluid . The eleven tracks of `` Inhabitants of Dis '' run like the wind , a sign of a pleasant album and of a prominent release by all means . The recipe of this album is not exactly new , however it pleases me and I find myself listening to it quite a few times.So ... Let the bloodshed begin!Abyss Magazine @ Nuno M. -LSB- CR -RSB-
 Another great work of the masters of the eclectic sounds.They always bringing an entyrely unique sound to mix . Travel around the currents of downbeat , jazz , soundtrack , chill out and the excellent instrumental version of Marvin 's `` Plays it cool '' and navigate with the two-step sound of Keli 's `` Suspended '' . This is a soundtrack without a movie or maybe the soundtrack of your own life .
 This is a good album , but I prefer Lazy Dog and Everything But The Girl 's Back to Mine . These guys assisted Greg Dulli with Twilight Singers , so I 'd recommend that one as well .
 this is a good dvd . it has a good concert , music videos , and cool extra interviews . pick this dvd up man .
 Da Hool is very wellknown in the bigest disco 's of Europe -LRB- The privelige of IBIZA included -RRB- . This CD includes his bigest hit in europe `` Meet her at the love parade '' . Be prepared to move as soon as this CD hits your speakers . Hit the repeat button because you want to hear this great CD over and over again . If you do like Techno you need to have this otherwise your CD collection wo n't be complete .
 Rag Men - s/t CDEulogy RecordsEver since Rag Men release three songs online I 've been waiting for more work from this all-star hardcore band . The line up consists of the following people
 The expectations of this CD were very high , because it features members of Madball and Merauder and ex-members of bands such as Earth Crisis , Hatebreed and Skarhead not the most insignificant bands in the HC scene . After listening to this album once , I was convinced ; this is gon na be one of the biggest bands in the world . The 8 songs on this album are full of brutal hardcore in the vein of Hatebreed , Madball and Biohazard . The voice of Jorge Rosado is the kind I like . As low and distorted as I could be -LRB- very aggressive and powerful -RRB- ! If you wan na know more about Rag Men visit their site . www.ragmen.net
 Rag Men is the collaboration of 2003 . Joined by members of bands such as Skarhead , Hatebreed and Merauder . An allstar team like this has to prove their quality , perhaps more then any other band that releases their debut . With 8 songs , Rag Men is up to the challenge ! The songs middle between mid-tempo groovy hardcore in a song like `` Obstacles '' and faster more oldschool orientated songs like `` Visions Of You '' . Especially in that song , Jorge -LRB- ex-Merauder -RRB- proves that he is worth the mark `` one of the best singers in the scene '' . A lot of bands do sound like another band , Rag Men takes all kinds of hardcore styles and mixes it in a new style . Let 's say `` Rag Men style '' . Rag Men passes the exam big time .
 This one needs a reissue . Recorded by the BBC in 1978 for television , this video is well done . After video of stage setup to Rosalie , Thin Lizzy explodes onstage . The performance is outstanding , and the band gives 100 % throughout this entire video . Robbo gives one his best performances on Still In Love With You , Brian D. has an outsanding drum solo -LRB- no boaring performance here -RRB- , and at the end Robbo and Phil go through a unique guitar/bass exchange after Robbo 's solo and Scott takes over with a lightning solo of his own -LRB- A band with 2 great guitar players that can share a stage -RRB- . Bring this one back , and let the fans know this time !! Rosalie -LRB- pre concert stage set up -RRB- , The Boys are Back in Town , Emerald , Dancing in the Moonlight , Massacre , Still in Love With You , Do n't Believe a Word , Are You Ready ? , Sha-la-la , Baby Drives Me Crazy , Me and the Boys . 54 minutes .
 The celebration of Duke Ellington a century after his birth has produced a wealth of tributes and , thankfully , some fine reissues of his work . This CD takes a more contemporary approach to Ellington 's music resulting in a sort of smooth jazz sampler of the Duke . It 's a very entertaining approach with some stellar work by an all-star roster of artists . Well worth a listen .
 The CD has awesome jazz vocals from some the greatest . Is has quickly become of my favorites .
 The man is BACK ! . Ricky I missed ya , you do n't know what a relief it was to hear new Southern rock again . Coming from a band that was original Southern Rock 's last band to make any good music . Classis like Fly Away , Train Train , and Highway Song are a essential listen . Mr. Medlocke returns to crack out more rockers and ballads with a few cover songs thrown in . A bit past his prime , Blackfoot is releasing much better S. rock now than any other Southern has-been outfit . Man , it ; s good to hear new Blackfoot , fans of old wo n't be let down .
 Probaly about 3.75 stars but I thougth I would give it 4 . I do n't like everything on it and it 's not as good as Maurauder , Strikes , or Tomcatin but it does have some good tunes on it . Nobody Rides For Free , Tonigth , After the Reign , and Bandelaro are the best one 's on it . It 's not quite as heavy as 80 's Blackfoot ... title track is the most like the early 80 's stuff .
 Blackfoot went out with a bang on AFTER THE REIGN . This was n't another FLYIN ' HIGH , STRIKES , TOMCATTIN ' , or MARAUDER , and yes , it has more cover versions than it should , but it still contains some good originals , especially `` It 's All Over Now '' , which could be about saying goodbye to people you were once good friends with , but with whom you now have little or nothing in common . An excellent way to end a career - or is it really the end ?
 For those of us who grew up on Blackfoot from 1975 on ... for those of who did grow up ... should appreciate this grown-up sound . This is a release that 's unafraid to do what it wants and not what 's current or dictated by the past .
 Masterpiece like all the works of Blackfoot . if you like Rickey Medlock voice and blackfoot this cd is great he is over shadowed in lynyrd skynyrd
 another decent blackfoot album out of print with good songs nobody rides for free , tupelo honey , sittin on top of the world , but the best song on here is the album title after the reign , you can really tell the indian influence is in this song , not quite as good as medicine man album but if you can find this one too another gem . .
 Blackfoot is a great group always has been . since medlocke left the stuff produced today is blackfoot but its missing something called rickey . after the reign has a great cover of van morrisons Tupelo honey son houses Sittin on top of the world . but when you need to complete an album you sometimes musicians use cover songs . this album has agreat deal of killer blackfoot stuff . an i know because i own all of the rickey medlocke blackfoot . No reservations , flying high , strikes , tomcattin , marauder , siogo , verticle smiles , rick medlocke and blackfoot , then came medicine man a great and heavy blackfoot record then after the reign . i have em all and i this one is as good as anything medlocke has ever done . buy it and see for yourself if your just now discovering blackfoot youll buy all you can after you hear this . what a great note for rickey to end blackfoot on . though i he brings his blackfoot back .
 Not the original lineup but it has Medlocke . I really liked this album , every song is good . I tapped my foot thru the whole thing . I listen to it a lot . Buy it .
 After the Reign is another very good Medlocke album . Not his very best but very good . Song After the Reign is good as is Sitting on Top of the World , Nobody Rides for Free . An album that die hard Medlocke and Blackfoot fans should have .
 THIS IS THE LAST BLACKFOOT ALBUM AND EVEN THOU SOME OF THE ORGINIAL MEMBERS HAVE PUT BACK TOGETHER BLACKFOOT THEY DO N'T HAVE RICKY MEDLOCKE . MEDLOCKE IS AND WAS BLACKFOOT AND ONCE HE DECIDED TO END THE BAND AND JOIN SKYNYRD BLACKFOOT ENDED WITH HIM . THIS ALBUM WAS A GREAT FINISH TO THE BAND AND A GREAT ALBUM OVERALL . IT HAS A BIT MORE OF A COUNTRY AND BLUES FEEL BUT IT 'S STILL GREAT SOUTHERN ROCK . THE MAIN SONGS OF INTEREST ARE
 There never be another Strikes album , but I 've always been a fan of Blackfoot and I 'm a fan of this album . There 's a maturity here , perhaps a mellowing or taming of the wildman -LRB- Medlocke -RRB- and songs such as Rainbow and It 's all over now show depth . If you 've aged right along with him , you 'll appreciate the album .
 These past years , we 've heard so much from Lionel Richie on his own , that is more from his daughter Nicole and her antics with Paris Hilton on The Simple Life . But , on Lionel 's own , he has shown a lot more promise as a artist on his own who has made quality music . While he has shown that on stage , many hard core fans have anxiously wondered if Lionel Richie will ever reunite with his old group The Commodores . Well , word of mouth has came alive that Lionel is set to reunite with the 70 's soul group for a tour for the first time in over twenty-five years . But , the deal is seeing whether is groups ' classics can be re-introduced to a generation that seems to be more interested in who has to be hot today wannabes like Britney Spears and Beyonce ' . This collection can answer those questions well.The 2008 Commodores Gold , is the groups ' latest hits collection that does a great job at bringing back the brick houses to a whole new era . The double album does a great job at not just bringing Lionel Richie 's work as lead into play , but brings their best from the 70 's and 80 's , without any of their hits that 've been overlooked from previous hits collections like the 2005 Lionel Richie & The Commodores Gold , or the 20th Century Remasters
 Why did Universal release a Lionel Richie/Commodores combination `` Gold '' set , and not release a collection for each artist separately , surely each artist is worthy of a 2-disc compilation ! Also , why was n't this excellent collection released in the U.S. ? Sure , it 's a reissue of a 1995 collection , and it tends to have single versions of many of the tracks , but what you get is some excellent remastering and a great collection of The Commodores ' best tracks both with and without Mr. Richie . My only complaint that it does n't have the song `` Lay Back '' . The following tracks are edited version which appear in their full-length versions on the Lionel Richie/Commodores `` Gold '' CD.EasyJesus Is LoveJust To Be Close To YouOh NoSail OnStillSweet LoveThree Times A LadyToo Hot Ta TrotZoom
 Lionel Richie did the thing as a Songwriter & lead Vocalist . He was too Cold on the Microphone . Lionel was bringing that dirty South Pimping Flavor on cuts . `` Sail On '' is pure Pimping just on that line Good times never felt so good . that was cold . same thing on `` Easy '' girl I 'm leaving you tommorow . if you listen to the way Lionel does a Lyrical Build up & then just drops that cold vibe on you that shows you that this Soul Brother can Write a Song . `` Just to be Close to you '' is also bringing that Playa , Playa vibe as well . when he sings I need you baby & He Hits that Note , then you thinking Gravy on Mash Potatoes because it hits you just like Dat . these songs are still hitting & are timeless .
 I love the commodores , I grew up listening to them . I really love the slow ones . Not so crazy about the fast songs .
 This is a great CD ... for `` Dancin & Romancin '' Well worth the money ... a music must have for any Commodores fan
 Another group i was blessed to see in live concert back in the 80 's but i had been loving them since the 70 's . This time and era is one that just will not die when it comes to music . No such thing as one hit wonders . They have alot of wonderful , soulful hits to listen to and feel great no matter how life is going for you . Put this cd on and let it take you far away to another place of happiness . I love the commodores as a group with lionel ritchie but i was never able to get into lionel by himself . He was better with the commodores . I love them and their timeless songs !!!
 I was not disappointed and I can truly can say it was the second best purchase that I had made in my life ! The first being DVD player/recorder ...
 This is packed with all the classic Commodores hits , including Painted Picture which is one of my favorites . This is well worth the money . Oh , the sound quality is good as well .
 Hi Airplaners : As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book `` Take Me To A Circus Tent '' I put together this information for you and hope it gives you the best source of making a judgement about the recording . If you do n't already have the music , please do n't be turned off by the change of sound quality . Many times in order to acquire previously unreleased music you ca n't always have it sound like George Martin was part of the project.This is the same as `` Cleared For Take Off '' Acrobat -LRB- U.K. -RRB- ACMCD 4001 CD released 11/6/03 -LRB- Taken from the Winterland , San Francisco , California performances of 3/10 -3 / 12/67 -RRB- but puts the tracks in a different order and on two CD 's . The sound quality changes throughout the CD and the pops come at no extra charge . Although the CD was n't put together with the greatest respect to the band or fan -LRB- Some songs fade-out and have wrong titles -RRB- , those that do n't own the material will be interested . There should have been one version of everything played during the three nights . The CD does n't include `` And I Like It '' , `` Let Me In '' , `` Fat Angel '' , or the jam . No information was given in the liner notes about the dates used for the songs so I have included that for you . `` 3/5 Of A Mile In To Seconds '' 3/11/67 , `` Do n't Let Me Down '' 3/10/67 , `` Do n't Slip Away '' 3/10/67 , `` She Has Funny Cars '' 3/12/67 , `` Let 's Get Together '' -LRB- Fades-out -RRB- 3/11/67 , `` High Flying Bird '' 3/12/67 , `` It 's No Secret '' 3/12/67 , `` Come Back Baby '' -LRB- Listed as `` Jorma 's Blues '' -RRB- 3/12/67 , `` Plastic Fantastic Lover '' -LRB- Intro cut -RRB- 3/11/67 , `` Runnin ' Round This World '' -LRB- Listed as `` Running Round The World '' -RRB- 3/11/67 , `` Somebody To Love '' -LRB- W / `` Leave You Alone '' which was not listed -RRB- 3/10/67 , `` The Other Side Of This Life '' 3/11/67 , `` Thing '' -LRB- Fades-out -RRB- 3/11/67 , `` Tobacco Road '' 3/10/67 , `` Today '' 3/11/67 , `` White Rabbit '' 3/12/67 , `` Bringing Me Down '' -LRB- Listed as `` You 're Bring Me Down '' -RRB- 3/11/67 , and `` My Best Friend '' -LRB- Listed as `` You 're My Best Friend '' -RRB- .

Anyways I give this CD 10 * if I could ...
 One of the founding fathers of Contemporary Christian Music , Terry Taylor has released more material than any other active artist in the CCM world , that I know of . He has written for , produced and/or contributed to multiple bands and various projects , but his most personal work is saved for his solo efforts.This disc contains songs from Taylor 's three solo records
 I fully concur with the multitude -LRB- okay , the one -RRB- reviewer about T.S.T 's solo work . I first heard it in the late 80s and was so moved I took the bold step of sharing it with a girl I loved -LRB- she was so much wiser and more versed in music than I -RRB- . Much to my surprise , she liked it and I felt , in some way , validated . -LRB- Please forgive the nostalgia -RRB- Sadly the girl is gone , but the music remains . For those of you who have wisdom , check out Terry 's recent work -LRB- Daniel Amos ' 2 CD set is beyond words ! -RRB- and those with the Lost Dogs . His writing is a combination of everything from Blake to the Beatles and beyond.As for his solo work , as defined in this disc , I feel that this his best . His words and voice paint pictures that shine . You do n't have to be Christian to enjoy it -- only human .
 If you do n't own a copy of this LP , get one NOW . In the Rhino Box-Set `` Mr. Excitement '' the writer says apart from the hit single , `` Higher & Higher '' and a solid remake of `` Open The Door To Your Heart '' , the rest of the album is weak . He must have been listening whilst asleep - this album is a stunner . Unlike the beautifully delicate Whispers LP , this one storms from start to finish , with a truly soulful ballad thrown in called `` I Do n't Need You Around '' . `` You Can Count On Me '' is the last song I want to hear just before I die . It is quicker to pick the poor tracks on Jackie 's LPs , but there is n't one here ... Please come back Jackie , you are sorely missed ...
 Jackie Wilson was one of the baddest Musical artists ever . the Man was smooth and could Sing/Sang with the best of them . he was in the same class as Sam Cooke and James Brown back in the day . He truly had a unique style about him . this album is smooth and on time . the Motown band is on here and Jackie is leding the way . the Man could sing anything and make it sound so smooth . a Must have . the Brother is so underrated .
 Jackie Wilson is one of my all time favorite singers from the late 50 's through the 60 's . I watched him appear many times on the Ed Sulivan show , `` Shin Dig '' , Dick Clark and others . His vocal range was that of an Opra Singer , many times when I listen to him I think he would have done much better singing Opra as I do n't believe the audiences back then truly appreciated his abilities to go from gritty soul to high , high notes that would rival any Opra singer . This is a good CD with a sample of his many abilities vocally !!!
 I THINK JACKIE WILSON 'S SONG HIGHER AND HIGHER IS MORE THAN HE EVEN HAS REALIZED . THE SPIRITUAL SIDE OF THIS SON IS WONDERFUL . BECAUSE THE LORD IS THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN LIFT YOUR LOVE AND HIS LOVE FOR YOU GETS HIGHER AND HIGHER EVERY DAY . THANKS
 This is simple a beautiful popsong sung by one of the most beautiful voices in modern pop-rock . Nash , best known as the singer of Sixpence None the Richer , is here into a more mainstream pop-style than she 's usually known for . But as long as the material is as great as in this case , it does n't really matter .
 this song is about lyrics , lyrics , lyrics . and leigh nash 's beautiful vocals.i loved the bounce movie , but this song is more beautiful . actually , its one of our `` songs '' for my boyfriend and I. i think it should have recieved radio play , but i do n't think it did . my favorite version of this song is the movie mix , which is more like and extended version . the only song i did not like is walking with strangers which is not sung by leigh nash . i just did not connect with it at all.need to be next to you is a good song for all you hopeless romantic types . the music video is really cool , it has images from the movie , which enhances what i just said about being a hopless romantic . . so with that being said i give 4 out of 5
 This is a wonderful CD ! The traditional hymns are accompanied by a variety of instruments - fiddle , Irish flute , uilleann , harp , etc. . These instruments enhanced the hymns and made the message more personal and real for me . After listening to the CD , I felt like I had been in Ireland ! Refreshing and inspiring music !
 This latest album by Eden 's Bridge is AWESOME . It combines the hymns that most people know from their walk in lifetime of walking in faith with the Celtic mystique and sound . I have listen to my copy of this CD over and over again.The music is uplifting and soothing for the soul . It 's a wonderful piece of music to just reconnect with your Higher Power , yourself and life all around . Everyone needs music like this to release their tenseness from the hustle , bustle of everyday life . This CD really is transcending to places far beyond where the listener is.I am an ecclectic music fan and Celtic is one of the areas I truly appreciate . What 's wonderful about this CD is that you get the spirit and soul of Ireland and its folk lore , yet the music is peaceful and soul moving without being loud or constantly moving a a rapid pace.This was my first Eden 's Bridge offering and it was so awesome , that I had to go back and find their previous other two releases to have a collection of their music . -LRB- Worship I and Worship II -RRB- Whether it is for the Celtic music , the Christian music or Both , I highly , highly suggest buying and trying this CD !
 Erich Leinsdorf is best known in the United States from his RCA recordings of Romantic and 20th century repertoire with the Boston Symphony from the 1960s , but he also recorded - here released anew by Universal - the first integral cycle of Mozart 's Symphonies in the late 1950s with the `` Philharmonic Symphony of London '' , actually Sir Thomas Beecham 's Royal Philharmonic under a different name.Leinsdorf served as an assistant to Toscanini in the late 1930s -LRB- he was in his 20s then -RRB- and became known as `` The Right hand of Toscanini '' as a nick-name . Leinsdorf also emphasizes the Classical , the linearity and lightness of Mozart
 Conductor Erich Leinsdorf 's recordings of these symphonies are superlative . Have n't heard all yet , but the major ones are precise , well-balanced , and very musical and moving .
 Here on Amazonia , there have been any number of philippics directed against Erich Leinsdorf and they may be justified . I do n't know . This is my first encounter with him . Until recently , I was unaware of this set 's existence . It was commissioned to commemorate the Bicentenary back in 1956 and the orchestra is the Royal Philharmonic , Beecham 's last orchestra . At the time of the recording , it was as close to being a crack unit as what it has ever been . The first half of the cycle is in stereo , the remainder is atmospheric mono . I can well believe that DG has successfully revamped the sound.This cycle is nothing short of amazing . It easily eclipses my other recent acquisition , Mozart-wise -LRB- Complete Fortepiano Concerto -RRB- . As other reviewers have noted , this is propulsive Mozart in the outer movements and minuets - it 's about as far removed from the Karl Bohm Memorial Mortuary -LRB- Mozart
 Levi Kreis is one of the most amazing singer-songwriters I 've ever heard . This album is entirely acoustic , most tracks are simply Levi and the piano , and in my opinion , that 's all anyone needs ! His style ca n't be contained to one word , so I wo n't attempt to pigeon-hole him like that . His vocals are full of power and passion , and resonate with a heart-felt sincerity . His songs are brilliant , personal , vulnerable , and ultimately , enjoyable . I listen to this album and `` The Gospel According to Levi '' every day now!Levi Kreis
 This is one of the best CD 's that I own in my collection of over 1000 cd 's ! Levi Kreis ' voice is simply phenomenal ! He has a very tender and powerful range that is very pure . I love the rawness and imperfections in the inflections as well!This is a MUST HAVE for any music lover !
 It does n't get much better than this . If you like Joshua Payne , you will love Levi Kreis . Personal lyrics and beautiful melodies that make you want to hug someone and smile.Listen to `` I Should Go '' and you 'll understand .
 Levi Kreis ' `` One of the Ones '' is one to own . As others here have said , his voice is beautiful , his lyrics honest , the accompanying music reveals his love for Jazz , Blues , Pop , and Gospel . Like his other CD `` The Gospel According to Levi , '' I love every song . And for the first time in my life someone has given a voice to those like myself who 've had to lurk in the shadows of the popular media and the lives of `` normal people '' that dominate print , film , and music . Thank you Levi and God Bless !
 Incredible voice , magical pianist and soulful lyrics ... guess you missed the boat on this one . I 'll shop elsewhere .
 I just read an article on Levi and was drawn to his upbringing . I visited his website where I got a glimpse of his music and was blown away . Too bad Amazon does n't have snippets to sample - you must listen to this guy . His music is pure - only a piano and his voice . I fell in love with his delivery - totally the opposite of the more popular and overproduced sound in music today . Sample his songs on his website -LRB- www.levikreis.com -RRB- and I think you 'll agree - the talent is there , I just hope the rest of the world catches on .
 I do not give a 5 star lightly!Levi Kreis ... My prediction for the next big thing . Absolutely magical what he does on the piano . A voice that has a vulnerability to it that just makes you feel what he is saying . I got the CD recently for Christmas and I feel such a connection to him . I 'm not normally into the not so known people , but his talent can not be ignored ! I highly suggest this CD for anyone !
 I 'm disappointed for the first time since I 've been buying from Amazon.com . I can not believe that this CD is not available . I read an article on Gay.com about this new artist and went to his website . Absolutely amazing . Go to his website , levikreis.com and listen to his music . It will touch your heart and soul . There is a beautiful passion , vulnerability , and sensuality in his voice that I have never heard before . Not many artists or songs can make you cry the first time you listen to them , but his do . Incredible !
 I stumbled across this man on Myspace ... what a treat!His voice is so haunting.Being a gay male singer ... his words mean so much to the listener . `` I Should Go '' is the best song on the Cd with `` Lonely Sunday Morning '' being a close second . As you listen to the emotions ... you are right there with him . I hope he gets the attention he deserves . AMAZING .
 I ca n't believe I had never heard of him before . This is what should be on the radio , not that auto-tuned , over-produced crap ! With just a piano , you can really feel his voice and the stories he tells . Such a stunningly beautiful voice !
 I first heard Levi 's music on the Vampire Diaries and had to have this CD . I 'm happy to say that I like all of the music on the CD , but specifically the ballads .
 Something strange happened to me the first time I listened to this album . I fell completely in love with it . I should n't have . I 'm a fan of folk music , classical , Celtic music and bluegrass , 1960s serious rock and roll . I am not particularly a fan of pop music . But there is something about this young man 's voice , lyrics , piano , tunes -- everything wonderfully combines to create this totally amazing and fantastic album . I 'm trying to explain it but I 'm failing miserably . Let me put it this way
 Once in a great while we are blessed with an artist who emerges , as if from a cocoon , as resplendant as a butterfly . Such an artist is Levi Kreis . Learn his name , you 're going to hear big things from this young man.With all my degrees in music , i rarely swoon anymore . Heard too much , seen too much , and i certainly appreciate the greats of old and the few of today . Levi 's voice has such a plaintive , vulnerability that is is literally tear-inducing . I get choked up when i listen to his delivery of the tender lyrics in the songs that he writes ... and then sings . From the opening `` I should go '' , you will be touched . Having seen him live a few years back , i can say that it is impossible to describe his pianistic achievements and abilities . I saw one review , and if i may borrow a few words , . . `` to watch him play is like watching someone speaking in tongues . '' I might have paraphrased a bit . Find this young man 's music , listen to it , love it and share it.He is truly the real deal , and he 's going places .
 I love this CD ! It has become my favorite . I really like Levi 's singing and I enjoy the piano accompaniment that he provides for each song . Levi and the piano are a terrific blend . I enjoy this more than CD 's that have a lot of instrumentation .
 I 'm a singer/keyboardist myself and I was immediately drawn to Levi 's voice when I heard him singing the song `` Hardly a Hero '' in the movie Kiss the Bride . I had to stop the movie and search out on the internet who this was . I ordered this album and his second one and I 've been enjoying them immensely . I think he has a beautiful voice and on top of that he has a lot of great songs that are passionate , meaningful and also it 's music I can relate to . It 's so hard to find really good music these days . Or at least it 's been that way for much of the last 10 years at least in my opinion . Almost the entire album is piano/vocal and it 's amazing how full each song can be with just those two instruments . Highly recommend it !
 `` Everything needs an opposite . We have a White House , so now we need a Black House . '' `` The problem with Harlem is too much sex , drugs and violence . If we took all the children of Harlem and made them memorize the names of the 99 Pharaohs then there would n't be sex , drugs and violence in Harlem anymore . '' `` The Saturnians told me to play the music of the black prophet , Duke Ellington , but the black man paid no attention so now I am playing the music of the white prophet , Walt Disney , and spreading the shield of his beauty over the face of the Earth so the Saturnians will not destroy us '' -LRB- followed by a half hour jam of ` Pink Elephants on parade ' which occasionally sounds like its source material -RRB- . Such is the wisdom and personality of the late free jazz artist Sun Ra -LRB- paraphrased quotes there , pulled from memory -RRB- who apparently -LRB- and delightfully -RRB- really believed in his own voluptuous excess and gibberish -LRB- enough to establish a Space Age monastic communal order among his followers ; the Intergalactic Arkestra , and , posthumously , a church named after him -RRB- . Claiming to be a Saturnian , Sun Ra would appear on stage , dressed in goodwill Pharaoh garb , with the planets of the solar system revolving around his head.In 1974 Sun Ra made his only film , Space is the Place , directed by John Coney , who also never made another movie . It is an odd artifact , a hybrid of science fiction , blaxploitation and -LRB- too little -RRB- avant-garde jazz.In the film , as in life , Sun Ra is the quintessential outsider and space is a metaphorical Eden for this much put upon black man . The plot is threadbare , involving villainous pimps and dealers , Black Panther avenger protagonists , local nightclubs , pool halls , cat houses , and , of course , an Outer Space Employment Agency that Sun Ra sets up after coming to Earth from a faraway planet . To recruit a new colony , he espouses racial freedom through Egyptian epigrams , Stockhausen-like jazz and a spirit filled Rocket Ship . Of course , Ra is challenged by establishment agents and a supreme villain , the Overseer -LRB- Ray Johnson -RRB- , who lures impressionable black men away from Ra 's brand of truth with the vices of sex and money . Ra preaches against decadence and hits a nerve when showing the pimp and his followers that they are no different than the White Man -LRB- Nixon , here -RRB- they rage against . Ra promises a land of racial harmony and social justice lies within the Milky Way 's stars , and who are we to argue?The film is as eccentric and inexplicable as Sun Ra himself . Space is the Place demands to be seen by every aficionado of bizarre cinema and equally bizarre jazz . The biggest complaint about the film is that there simply is not enough music , but that 's easily remedied by a sampling of essential Sun Ra albums . His discography is mind bogglingly extensive , but a good start is the soundtrack album `` Space is the Place , '' the earlier `` Super Sonic Jazz '' , `` Jazz in Silhouette , '' `` Futuristic Sounds , '' `` Atlantis , '' `` The Magic City , '' `` Cosmic Tones for Mental Therapy , '' and a personal favorite
 The early-1970s was a tumultuous time in American politics and the world landscape . Sun Ra weaves the political controversies with sci-fi and mythology for this 82 minute film that had a very limited run when initially released in 1974 . There is a universal message in Sun Ra 's production , with the music - released in a soundtrack - making for an outstanding package.Though available in often shoddy bootlegs , this DVD is a fitting tribute to the cinematic vision of an artistic genius .
 If you 're a fan of the avant garde , the obscure , or the psychedlic , please do yourself a favor , and get your hands on ` Space is the Place ' . Non-linear , but a true underground classic . Witness
 it is with great anticipation that I have been awaiting the plexifilms dvd release of SITP . Having seen the VHS version of the film countless times , as well as being aware of plexifilms high standards from the release of Wilco 's `` I Am Trying To Break Your Heart , '' my expectations have been high.the design of the package is clean and well done -- very classy . Although this is a new transfer of the film , this is hardly a restoration in the vein of `` Casablanca . '' There are still many blemishes and defects from the tranfer print that have not been cleaned up at all , as far as I can see . That said , color and saturation are richer , definition is clearer -LRB- especially noted in textures etc. -RRB- , blacks are deeper , and there are no evident digital artifacts from compression . The soundtrack has less background noise , and hiss , but this is hardly a new 5.1 remix or anything . In fact , I have yet to determine if the soundtrack is in stereo or mono . the most significant aspects of this release is that the frame has been restored to its original widescreen presentation , and roughly 15 minutes of footage has been restored . Unfortunately , the restored footage is mostly scenes of sex and violence and does little to further the plot . I understand why Sun Ra cut this footage for the VHS edition , and I actually prefer the shorter cut of the film.I found the interview with director and producer very good , but too short . the team comes across as being very sympathetic , supportive , and admiring of Sun Ra 's music and myth . There are some nice revelations -LRB- the bad effects are not just a budgetary limitation , but a satire of cheesy 50 's science fiction , sun ra wrote his own dialogue , the film was originally to be a concert film in a planetarium , etc -RRB- . Considering how much more light they could have shed though it is dissappointing only because it is too short . The interview is illustrated with some gorgeous previously unseen still promo shots from the set and film.For me the real jewel of this DVD are the `` Home Movies '' shot by Richard Wilkinson . Having not been there to see the earlier days of the Arkestra , those days are to me a mythic time . While watching the footage I was almost giddy with excitement , literally catching myself holding my breath in concentration ! The Arkestra at the pyramids , dancing , in the studio , in the streets , in concert . Great shots of Sun Ra , John Gilmore , June Tyson , Marshall Allen ... the stuff of dreams . amazing ! in fact , I would pay just to see this few minutes of film .
 this is a hard one to review . it seems very few people have seen this , or something . if you havent , you should , no matter who you are because it will fill you in on what 's going on and what they dont want you to know -LRB- surprised nobody 's seen it ? right ? -RRB- . like the title says , space is the place - it is where we are and there is no place else you can really go - or i s there . It helps to know a bit about mr Ra , Sun Ra that is . there 's a bunch of stuff on the web if you 're curious but i dont know exactly where off hand , but check it out , have a look because he is important . This is a profoundly important movie about blackness in america , but there 's a lot more to it than that , and its not preachy , it 's freaky , get it ? I mean i almost dont want to say that 's what it 's about because it is unlike anything you 've probably seen and it 's also about space and aliens and the devil and everything else .
 I picked up this curious period piece of psychedelic , indie-fueled moviemaking some time ago . Sorry now I waited so long to view it . It 's a delightful combination of ' 70 's pop culture , science fiction fantasy , Sun Ra musical storytelling through his Inter-Galactical Outer Space Archestra , and black pride allegory that manages to be quite on point.Initially , I was too fascinated by the imagery and music to think much about any message . In retrospect , Sun Ra is a spiritual being from a space colony playing chess with an earthly demonic pimpmaster for big stakes
 What a simultaneously hysterical with fits of lucidity presentation ! The running battle between Ra and `` Overseer '' is a great subtext . Gives some insights into the man , somewhat in spite of Sun Ra 's best efforts to stay a `` Mystery '' . The cheesey effects and over the top acting has to be viewed as an ultimate camp cult movie . A JOYFUL NOISE is almost as bizarre , but probably more accessible . Most of the charm is that you ca n't tell whether he is plain nuts or goofing with you . I understand this was very calculated and intentional on his part.Parliament / Funkadelic owe more to this guy than I think anybody realizes . I do n't know if George Clinton has ever acknowledged his debt to Sun Ra , at least conceptually , for doing the full blown conceptual thing decades before him .
 What a great super-fly atmosphere , Oakland in the early 70s . Ra has some great parts , and as always the music is tops.SPACE IS THE PLACE !
 This album has 12 old and beloved hymns . They are played so pleasantly , yet not errevently . I would love to have every album that Jim Hendricks makes .
 This album has a wonderful selection of old-fashioned hymns that we know and love . The music is so pleasant without being irreverent . I 'm so happy to have this album .
 All my old time favorites with beautiful variety of instruments . Love to listen to this any time & any where !
 Demo releases are often for fans only and reveal blemishes that are later fixed by clever producers . I find the opposite here . The slick production on the studio releases removed a lot of the personality of this band . This CD includes what I consider to be the best versions of many Records songs and makes me wish I had seen them live early in their career .
 I had the good fortune of being able to meet up with John Wicks a couple time over the last year or so and he and The Records are still making music and performing in LA. . This album is wonderful compilation of great music from these guys early days . A great version of Starry Eyes here too , not as produced as the single they had a hit with . These gues made so much great music that it 's ashamed they never made it big . But then neither did a lot of power-pop bands of this era . In any event , you 'll be happy with the great collection , but you 'll need to invest and Smashes and Crashes to complete your Records experience .
 I see why so many people in the business have been talking about her . It is time she stopped being the best kept secret . I listened to a lot of Cuban Jazz back home in Paris and in the time I lived in Barcelona and now in Acapulco . This is some of the best I 've heard in a long time . She is a beautiful singer . The band is very good , all acoustic . My favorites are `` Olvidame '' , `` Funny Little Dream '' and `` seashells '' which sounds like you are on the beach even though she uses no electric instruments . Beautiful music .
 Havana Carbo and I have been friends for years now -LRB- I should be shot for not writing this sooner ! -RRB- . And never have I felt so blessed as to be able to talk about a fellow musician 's work -- from a completely unbiased viewpoint -- that sounds as if I wrote it purely out of the personal relationship and love I have for the artist herself . The music is just that real ; just that good.Every song on this immaculate CD brings you back to a time when this Afro-Cuban/Brazilian sound was innovative and traditionally , gloriously old simultaneously ... when the feel of the beach and the ocean and the transcendent smile borne from a familial joy of the spirit of a people on the shores of Cuba -LRB- pronounce it right
 This music is absolutely enchanting and relaxing ! I 'm in love with the Havana Carbo 's music ! Very well done , full and luscious sound . I would recommend this to anyone who truly appreciates any genre of music .
 I do n't listen to a lot of jazz , but when a friend of mine lent me this CD I had to have my own copy . Havana Carbo is so smooth , and the band is so cool . Her voice and her music is very soothing and pretty without being boring . If she is part of the Latin Invasion in popular music only on the jazz end , I say bring it on !
 Gypsy jazz chanson and more blend with punk energy in this disc ... its hard to describe with French vocals over acoustic guitars , pianos , upright bass , brass , fiddle , accordian and more sound when combined ... Fans of music in general will like this ...
 This album brings together slide guitar legend Elmore James ' and guitarist John Brim 's waxings for the Chess label . It is not a collaboration between the two , but rather than put out two very brief CDs , MCA/Chess has opted to combine the two , much as they did on the Albert King/Otis Rush-album `` Door To Door '' . John Brim 's fine `` Ice Cream Man '' is the leadoff track , and he is the featured artist on five more numbers , including `` You Got Me '' , the `` Hound Dog '' - knockoff `` Rattlesnake '' , and the menacing `` Be Careful What You Do '' , all of which feature Robert `` Jr. '' Lockwood on guitar , drummer Fred Below , and Little Walter Jacobs playing the harmonica.But Brim 's contributions mostly pale next to the power and intensity of the great Elmore James , whose `` Madison Blues '' , `` Talk To Me Baby -LRB- I ca n't hold out -RRB- '' , and `` Whose Muddy Shoes '' are among his best songs . Backed by his fiery `` Broomdusters '' - combo , which features pianist Little Johnny Jones and the braying sax of J.T. Brown , James rocks on `` Madison Blues '' , grooves on `` The Sun Is Shining '' and a heavily reworked `` Dust My Broom '' , and smoulders on the slow `` I See My Baby '' and the soulful `` My Best Friend '' . And you 'll also find his version of T-Bone Walker 's `` Stormy Monday '' here , a truly powerful , dramatic rendition , perfectly suited to James ' huge , expressive voice and fiery slide playing.This is a must-have for any Elmore James fan , John Brim or no John Brim . Many of these songs are among James ' best , and only a couple of them are available on the various career-spanning Elmore-compilations .4 1/2 stars - highly recommended .
 I had the vinyl of this album about forty years ago . But it did not contain the same songs as this CD . It had about ten tunes featuring the legendary Elmore James , and one song with another singer who was not identified . I knew it was n't EJ . I could never quite figure out why only one John Brim tune was on that old record
 If you own one blues album , let it be this . You will fall down and adjure
 This is a blues compilation that is worth checking out . It contains a number of Elmore James ' best known Chess recordings as well as a few tracks by John Brim , whose song `` Ice Cream Man '' was covered by Van Halen on the first Van Halen album.If you 're just starting into older blues recordings , Elmore James is one of the essential artists you should be checking out . James was one of the great blues guitarists and composers . His material has been covered by Eric Clapton and Stevie Ray Vaughn , among others.John Brim was also a great guitar player and composer but he did n't record anywhere near as much material as James did . Brim 's recordings are hard to find ; this CD contains Brim 's best known work , including the track `` Ice Cream Man '' that was covered by Van Halen .
 When one thinks of the classic blues tune `` Dust My Broom '' one tends to think of the legendary Robert Johnson who along with his `` Sweet Home , Chicago '' created two of the signature blues songs of the pre-World War II period . However , my first hearing of `` Dust My Broom '' was on a hot LP -LRB- the old days , right ? -RRB- version covered and made his own by the artist under review , Elmore James . I have heard many cover versions since then , including from the likes of George Thorogood and Chris Smithers , and they all reflect on the influence of Elmore 's amazing slide guitar virtuosity to provide the `` heat '' necessary to do the song justice . Moreover , this is only the tip of the iceberg as such blues masters and aficionados as B.B. King and The Rolling Stones have covered other parts of James ' catalog.Perhaps because Elmore died relativity young at a time when blues were just being revived in the early 1960 's as part of the general trend toward `` discovering '' roots music by the likes of this reviewer he has been a less well-known member of the blues pantheon . However , for those who know the value of a good slide guitar to add sexiness and sauciness to a blues number James ' is a hero . Hell Thorogood built a whole career out of Elmore covers -LRB- and also , to be sure , of the late legendary Bo Didderly -RRB- . I never get tired of hearing these great songs . Moreover , it did not hurt to have the famous Broomdusters backing him up throughout the years . As one would expect of material done in the pre-digital age the sound quality is very dependent on the quality of the studio . But that , to my mind just makes it more authentic.Well , what did you NEED to listen to here ? Obviously , `` Dust My Broom '' . On this CD though you MUST listen to Elmore on `` Who 's Muddy Shoes ? '' Wow , it jumps right out at you . `` Madison Blues '' , `` Talk To Me Baby '' and `` Stormy Monday '' round out the minimum program here . Listen on .
 This CD shows what real music is all about
 This is a blues purists dream . Elmore James keeps things moving from the first tune , Ice Cream Man . He is one of the true greats that I rank with BB and Muddy , there is n't a tune here that does n't make me feel good . The classic Madison Blues to the Sky is Crying just makes me appreciate what blues are all about . I can only say buy this Cd . It is the perfect Blues for any mood is all I can say .
 This CD shows what real music is all about
 When I listen to Angie and Debbie I can almost visualize what heaven would be like . I like all of thier songs on thier first cd . But I have n't had the pleasure of hearing the second . None of the record stores have them . But `` What a place '' is my favorite .
 Angie and Debbie are an awesome sister duo who were rockin ' the mics long before MaryMary . With Angie sweet soothers and Debbies Cutthroat power chords , the girls truly need no help from their elder siblings . Check Out Angies solo album ` Music from my heart '' , and Look for Debbies soon coming solo release . Debbie also has a childrens cd currently in rotation that allows you to hear her voice by itself -LRB- althoough she has a lot of guest vocals on the cd , including her nieces and nephews -RRB- . You just got ta Love'em !
 I always was a fan of Angie and Debbie Winans way back . I agree with the other review before Mary Mary it was Angie and Debbie Winans . I heard every song they sang on the radio and I will forever love their music and their style of fashion in their music videos . Angie and Debbie Winans you rock !!!!!
 It follows the same trend as the ` Bold ' album and it is just as inspirin
 Although they lack the `` pipes '' of their elder siblings , the duo of Angie and Debbie present a credible excursion into the world of urban contemporary gospel . Exceptional cuts are `` Fact Is , Truth Is , '' `` Flashback , '' `` Why Wo n't You Love Me , '' and `` Come to Me . `` The real `` smoker , '' however , is `` Simply a Fanatic . '' With hard-driving rhythms and a lyric that explains the depth of the girls ' spirituality , there is no wonder that they are fanatics for the Lord . That particular selection is very relevant presentation that shows the pair 's potential .
 I bought this tape in Georgia a long time ago , wore it out and when I went back the place I got it from was gone . I love this music , if you like old time music you will love this tape or CD .
 I hope that someone who has this can answer a question for me ... I am thinking about buying this and I wonder if this is a compilation cd put together by Jim Hendricks or if he performs all of these songs.If it 's a compilation , would anyone consider posting the artists for me?Thanks in advance !
 some good stuff here for Mr. Black most of it either very funny or very on the mark . Not his best but good enough .
 Lewis Black continues to leave his fans rolling with laughter!The majority of this album is all new material , with only a few recycled gags , although they are well-placed . For his fans , they will definitely identify with his wit , antiestablishment rants , general angry ramblings , and quips on universal grievances . If you are unfamiliar with his comedy , I would advise you listen to samples first , or perhaps pick up his first or second album to give them a listen . You would probably be well-served to have some background information on Lewis Black first.My one real complaint was the length of the CDs themselves . There are 2 discs in this set , but I think if they tried hard enough , they probably could have reduced this down to one disc . I do n't know if the producers cut it this way on purpose just to get more discs out of this album , thereby allowing them to charge more money , but I think one disc would have been enough . Knowing this now , I still would have purchased it , and be glad for it , as the CD issue just does n't bring one down enough to miss out on the humor.By the way , parents or those with sensitivities to coarse language , be advised that Mr. Black uses quite a good deal of profanity and might not be appropriate for you or your children . I make no judgment calls on the matter , I just want to be sure you are aware of it . If this is n't a problem for you , then enjoy the album !
 Lewis Black is one of , if not the best contemporary comedian . I wish he would have been famous sooner so we could have enjoyed his work earlier . I love his political ramblings , and find his material informative as well as funny.I hope he continues to entertain us for a long time.A . Zelko
 TYPICAL LEWIS FUNNY START TO FINISH , TRUST ME YOU 'LL LAUGH ALOT WHAT ELSE COULD I SAY IT 'S LEWIS BLACK AT WORK
 This is Lewis Black at his outragous best . I did n't think he could do better than his last album . I WAS WRONG !!
 Some good lines , but some of his older stuff tops this one
 Lewis Black 's more recent recordings have seen him retreading over a lot of familiar material . The Luther Arts cd included almost a word for word performance of his End of the Universe work over Britney Spears and the Super Bowl.This cd set sees Lewis back on the top , with energy to spare , for an hour and a half of ranting , raving , and anger-laden comedic gold . While he does touch bits that he has touched before -LRB- most notably in his book -RRB- , his performance here does n't just feel like a repeat . Candy Corn has always been one of my favourite Black rants.His energy last him for all 85 minutes , which is surprising since he is such an `` anger-comic , '' and one would typically expect to run out of this energy after maybe 50 minutes . Not here . There are no typical long pauses or uneasiness that accompany even 45 minute performances of most comics . Lewis instead blasts his material out one after the other after the other , giving you just enough time to really laugh before getting you ready for the next joke or story.It is difficult to judge a comedy album , because comedians are so varied , as are people 's tastes . For most people , you either like Lewis Black or you do n't . For me , he is approaching a cynical , yet honest portrayal of the US that has not been reached since Bill Hicks . He is almost an extension of Bill Hicks himself . Bottom line - if you like Lewis Black already , this album will not disappoint . If you like Lewis , but feel that his last album or two have been kinda let-downs , this album will delight you . And if you do n't like Lewis Black , give this one a try . It 's his best work since The End of the Universe , and almost rivals his best work on both that album and the White Album . Even if you think he 's one you have to watch instead of listen to , this one may be one of those you say `` Well , y' know ... I have n't listened to Carnegie in a while . `` For only 15 dollars , you are getting nearly twice what you get with `` headliner '' performances . Also , the packaging is just wonderful . Gatefold CD 's almost always impress me , and this one was just great . Hold the case in the light a certain way , and a negative or postive of Lewis Black appears . There are no extras , no bells or whistles on this cd . Just an hour and a half of pure comedy bursting from Lewis Black.For Carnegie shows , one expects the best . After all , every comic since Lenny Bruce has had to live up to that historic night when Bruce played to thousands in the Hall . Well , Lewis , congratulations . Whatever notion that I had of you faltering or losing your touch - gone ! Out the window . Bye ! Bye !
 Yeah , I 'll gladly recommend this album because it 's Lewis Black and it 's a LOT of him . I 'm not gon na get bogged down in the issue of `` Does it really stand up to his end of universe album ? It 's inferior to his performance on Feburary 7th 1995 at a small coffee shop back in Springfield Ohio ... '' Let 's get past all that shall we ? Thanks.Here 's why I say BUY IT . First off , it 's a lot o ' bang for your buck . I 'm always happy when a comedy album is a double . I like a long performance -LRB- provided it 's good . -RRB- I like hearing someone really get in a flow and go for as long as is necessary . Here , Lewis has his opportunity to take all that rage and dumbfounded disbelief at the world and just put it all out there.And it 's good stuff too . Lewis can WRITE , he can TELL STORIES too . His story about performing his surgically sanitized material with Dick Cheney sitting next to him is a priceless listen . Lewis cranks out entertaining stuff that is still MEATY too.One of the things that got me about this album though that I finally figured out just the other day is this . As a rule I USUALLY do n't like comedy recordings in LARGE VENUES . I 'd rather hear a recording done in a small club . It 's more intimate , you can hear the personality of an audience reaction . Most large show recordings , the audience just washes out into a rolling wave of laughter that waxes and wanes at the appropriate times . It usually lacks feel . For some reason , I 'm OK with that on this album and I finally figured it out . In this album , Lewis is also ORATING , and it feels very much in place with the large hall size . For this particular recording it actually feels right.Anyway , I gladly recommend this to anyone looking to widen their comedy collections . If you 're NOT one of those comedy people , you may or may not go for it . It 's up to you really , who the crap am I?Oh and one final note . Lewis likes to use DIRTY WORDS . If you have problems with that , be warned . If you buy this , do n't go playing it with your six year old son in the house ... or anywhere near your house . Is Lewis DIRTY ? ... not as such . Just very vulgar .
 I 'll try to keep this short because I wrote a thesis on this CD and erased it five minutes ago . Why ? You are wondering about this CD and whether to buy it.It 's not his best complete performance but there are tracks on the CD that will beat almost any routine you can think of -LRB- even Italians who Just Saw Rocky -- Eddie Murphy -- by a nose no pun intended -RRB- . Maybe I am dissapointed that I did not see it live . Still , he carries the audience -LRB- and listener , me -RRB- because he is just a schmuck up on the stage spewing amazingly funny stuff out of nowhere . Another aspect that I admire about this CD is that his pace is different . His style is different . He could be the pissed off guy you work with who does n't shut up except 100 times funnier . So ... Lewis Black fans - you know you are gon na buy this CD so forget it.Comedy Central fans -LRB- ie those who have seen him a few times on TV -RRB- - cough up the money if not for the entire performance but for some unforgettable tracks.Comedy fans in general - It 's hillarious to listen to but first just get a glimpse of the guy on TV or broadband . Then sit back and enjoy.Everyone else - I think in these days of confusion , lies , partisanship , apathy , terrorism , atomic bombs , whatever -- track eight , disc two should be required reading/listening .
 Love it ! Laughed so hard my face hurt . Just be careful when listening to it in the car - you look like a psycho to others .
 I 've enjoyed Lewis Black every since watching him a few years ago on Comedy Central Presents . . he continues to deliver and im sure will continue to deliver in the future . very funny political views / not for the faint of heart !
 The Grand Majesty of Carnegie Hall , the name , the fame , quitessential respect . The heir to angry comedy finds his throne on a respectable stage at last . I bought this album because it 's required to buy his albums as soon as they hit stores when you own a funny bone . I am also desperate after memorizing every Bill Hicks album I own . This is n't a bite on Lewis , though , he 's a funny mofo all by his self.At the very outset , Lewis Black seems to think he 's obliged to explain why he 's there at Carnegie . He goes straight through the factors of his conception to his influential Jewhood . This seems very boring in the beginning , relaying his history , but I guess that 's mid-life combined with playing a famous Opera house that he says he dreamed of playing when he started.The entire two discs easily constitute a , `` My Life '' ordeal , contemplating his own thinking on a big stage where he feels reborn . He apparently was thinking very big , and put his entire history as a comic into this performance . Gone are the oft breakup rants , replaced by the controlled rants . He combines what seems to be a ` bibliography & biography ' with his political , intrapersonal , and stage-presence comedy . Hitting every current event , especially the then-recent Hurricane Katrina , and the Terry Schiavo fiasco , is a forte that few comics have anymore.One thing I continuously have to revel about , is that this album seems so huge , gigantic and all-encompassing . Lewis spent his time on Rules of Enragement , and the White Album being ideosyncratic , erratic , and very comfortable . His Luther Burbank Performance was very fresh , but without a whole lot of lasting substance . The End of the Universe was easily one of his best albums , his breakthrough , and his most original material combined with stage-finesse that could captivate anyone , on both sides of any spectrum in culture.This is a very close second to End of the Universe , but a different kind of album in the first place . Every artist that goes to Carnegie , whether it be Carlin , or Lenny Bruce , finds an introspective route and goes a long time with as respectable a performance as they can find within themselves . Every Carnegie album is like that , except Carlin 's HBO special , but he was still really moving at that point still.In actuality , I do n't know what to think about this performance . Great quality is obvious , but it 'll require a test of time to see if it catches on with internet-generation audiences .
 This CD is one of Lewis Black 's best . I will say , I was a tad disappointed by the Luther Burbank CD as it seemed to have many skits from previous recordings.This CD has a lot of new material plus the Candy Corn rant that while was in his Comedy Central special , never was on CD before.Definitely recommend this one !
 As always , Lewis Black never fails to deliver , and this album is no exception . I learn more about politics from him , than from any other source ! -LRB- kidding ... but you have to admit , he gets to the core of the issues -RRB- This album was much better than his performance on Last Laugh 2007 . Now ... if only he was not such a hot head , he 'd make a good president !! Enjoy !!
 Even as a long time fan of Lewis Black , this album made me laugh like the first time I heard one of his rants . Since The White Album and End of the Universe , Black has refined his craft into one of the greatest of today . For me , this album shows that he is truly the heir to George Carlin 's angry comedy ... and thank God ! We could all use a little more Carlin-esque dark comedy .
 Lewis is at the top of his game here . It 's amazing to me how he can turn practically anything into a riot -LRB- even if it 's spewed angrily -RRB- , whether it 's something as controversial as the Terry Schiavo circus or something as mundane as candy corn . He never ceases to make me laugh , with endless ways of phrasing his anger , disgust , disappointment , or grudging indifference towards anything . You can practically see him walking around the stage , shouting angrily , seething , and waving his arms . He expresses his discontentment with so many things , but in such a way that it 's hilarious , not depressing.You can tell from a few listens to Lewis Black that he 's pretty heavily influenced by George Carlin , and Carlin himself has praised Lewis highly . And at the risk of pissing off some people that think Carlin 's untouchable , I would put this CD right up there with a lot of Carlin 's work -LRB- and for me , better than some of it -RRB- . He does n't disappoint , making me roar almost non-stop for an hour and a half , sometimes so much that it starts to hurt , and it holds up well on repeated listens . I would recommend this CD -LRB- along with most of his other work -RRB- as highly as anything .
 If you like Sigur Ros , Byork , Radiohead , etc. you will love this band ! Worth every penny across the board !
 I listened to this Jazz on the Public Jazz station in denver and was totally blown away . I tried to purchase it at several stores in town and could not find it . What a waste of excellent music . How is Adam Rafferrty suppose to make a living if the music he produces can not be bought ?
 This album by Rasheeda is HOT OF THE CHAIN !! Her HOT `` Dirty South '' album is beans when compared to this SIZZLING album ... it 's just THAT GOOD.I agree with the other reviewer who says shes no Kim . . cuz they 're right ... she 's BETTER THAN KIM !! Maybe her lyrics are on the same par as Kim 's . . but her delivery , flow , voice . . everything in that category tops Kim in my opinion.This is probably one of the BEST and UNDERRATED albums that came out this year . Cop this one , you wo n't regret it !! Favorite Song
 RASHEEDA has really made a spectacular album here ! Every single track is incredible and is really upbeat and great to listen to and get your head noddin ' . Each track after the other was just as fun and awesome as the next . Before I knew it the CD was over and I had to start listening to it again . An EXCELLENT album , you wo n't be disappointed . Way to go , Rasheeda ! Love ya and hope your next album is as upbeat and awesome as `` Georgia Peach '' is . : -RRB-
 Already fan of Rasheeda from another one of her albums . So i knew what the deal was as far as her flow . She deliver her lyrics with no hesitation and on point as well . I love the majority of the tracks on here except maybe 3 at the most -LRB- Type of Girl , Chanel Shades -LRB- its ok -RRB- and Who Can Love You -RRB- . Everything else is on point and straight fire , love the beats and lyrics , and the featured artists that appear on it as well.A few of the songs that i love rocking : You Can Get ItBuy My DrinkPack Ya Bags feat KalennaLifestyle feat Gangsta Boo , Diamond & Princess -LRB- Crime Mob -RRB- - My favLet It ClapEvery Rapper Ca n't TrapTouch Ya ToesI 'm glad she 's still out there doing her thing and rep 'n for Atl . Keep doin the thing . I 'll be rockin Georgia Peach for more than a little bit . Nice purchase .
 Yo ... this cd is straight youngin . I remember her blazin tracks a few years back with Pastor Troy . Now she done hooked up with the super producer NITTY , the same one that blessed Yung Joc , and brought heat like n **** s wearin sweaters in the summer . A must cop 4 sure . Everythang tite baby . Holla when it 's gangsta . Peace .
 Just because of the tracks she does with Akon , she gets 5 stars . Would I ever buy this album ? Probably not , but she is one of the female best MCs .
 A double cd , consisting of a 2 hours continious mix ... The 4 first track on Cd 2 are extremely Funky , and the rest ai n't to bad either ... some crazy remixes of well known tracks are included also ... : -RRB-
 or maybe you are a Gentle Giant fan missing the Shulman Bros wit . Look no more . I bought this on advice of a friend and well this is the progressive rock sound I have been missing . You want Gentle Giant then listen to Knots ... . er ... ahhh ... that is Gibberish . In it you 'll find melodies from Gentle Giant 's Octopus album . Want a ballad for top 40 's radio - its there in Ca n't Get It Wrong . Want the long epics Yes was famous for - The healing Colors of Sound or Day For Night fit perfectly . There is not alot of fancy keyboard in this to appease the Wakeman fan BUT they do n't waste the sound either . It all fits . If this work had been made in the 80 's when Yes , ELP , Gentle Giant , Genesis -LRB- when they were worth a listen to -RRB- made music they would have been a perfect fit . These guys are n't good . . they are VERY VERY GOOD and a very CLEAN sound . Give them a listen ... You will not be sorry and be ordering the complete catalogue as I am .
 Look lets get to the point , this band is first class . Im SCOTTISH , the UK invented prog rock , but lets face it the yankee doodles have got their act together . Go for it guys , your a very very talented bunch of musos , and first class songwriters . KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK ! PS . IF YOU TOUR , COME TO SCOTLAND FIRST !
 When I first purchased the band 's last album , `` Kindness of Strangers '' , it spent a week of continuous play in my CD player . `` Day For Night '' has been in it for more than twice as long . And I still have n't had enough!I ca n't say enough about this band . They 've combined the best elements of `` pure '' prog -LRB- esp . Gentle Giant -RRB- with the best of `` catchy pop '' prog -LRB- like Kansas -RRB- and the result is the best album I 've listened to in years .
 When I first purchased the band 's last album , `` Beware of Darkness '' , it spent a week of continuous play in my CD player . `` Day For Night '' has been in it for more than twice as long . And I still have n't had enough!I ca n't say enough about this band . They 've combined the best elements of `` pure '' prog -LRB- esp . Gentle Giant -RRB- with the best of `` catchy pop '' prog -LRB- like Kansas -RRB- and the result is the best album I 've listened to in years .
 The Morse bros. and company continue to grow and grow musically , with this easily the strongest material to date . Their last effort `` Kindness Of Strangers '' -LRB- still an unbelievable disc -RRB- was strong but seemed to lack the direction that `` Day For Night '' displays . Awesome vocals , awesome musicianship , awesome arrangements , ... AWESOME ! If you consider yourself in the least to be a fan of the modern prog movement DO N'T let this one pass you by . PROG RULES !!!!!
 Spock 's Beard - in the underground reemerging scene of progressive rock in the United States , these guys are regarded as one of the best bands around . With Day For Night , however , the Beard wo n't stay an underground favorite for long . While they stay grounded in their progressive rock roots , they have managed to produce an album pleasing to both mainstream rock fans and progressive rock fans . This is truly a masterpiece . Unfortunately , Amazon has an incorrect track listing so do n't be fooled - there are 13 track on the CD , the last few of which comprise the epic Healing Colors of Sound . Not to be missed is ` Distance To The Sun , ' an instant classic showing the vocal talent of the entire band.While not as strictly progressive as past efforts , Day For Night is a fine album . Its hard to stress how much finer this album is than the majority of the stuff you find in record stores these days .
 ` Day for Night ' , like any Spock 's Beard album , is literally crammed with moments of sublime invention and beauty . Although this album took longer to grow on me than any of the other Beard albums , there is enough fantastic material on here to instantly merit the highest rating . The bands signature sound is intact , as is the format of the album laid down on previous releases , with an extended track and a mellower ballad both complementing the usual range of melodic , catchy and spectacularly executed pop influenced prog Neal Morse churns out so effectively.The title track is an instant classic , and is probably among the strongest cuts on offer here . Spectacular vocal harmonies towards the end of this song only hint at what is to be attempted on ` Gibberish ' , a delicate and in places plain odd song , with the bands vocal talents being showcased in their entirety for what seems like the first time . ` Skin ' completes an impressive opening trio , and this song posseses the most single potential , unleashing the kind of infectious and epic chorus only Neal Morse can produce . The albums strongest moment is certainly the obligatory concluding epic , the poweful ` The Healing Colours of Sound ' . Although the song is split into seperate tracks on the CD -LRB- I agree wholeheartedly with Lord_Chimp 's comment on this matter -RRB- the suite achieves continuity and a sustained texture very well . Its not the bands best extended track -LRB- see ` At The End of the Day ' or ` The Light ' -RRB- , but ` The healing Colours ' is another compelling addition to a back catalogue that is frightningly unblemished . Other highlights arrive with ` The Gypsy ' and ` Cant get it Wrong ' , the only full band composition here.A number of reviewers have commented on the lyrics , dismissing them as weak or ridiculous . While I dont think Morse is the best lyricist around today , I fell the lyrics work as an extension of the music , contributing to the overall texture of the song . Also , anyone trying to analyse the lyrics of a song called , um , ` Gibberish ' really needs to take a more objective standpoint.Once again a classic release form Spock 's Beard , ` Day For Night ' comes highly recommended .
 I must admit
 I 'm a huge progrock fan , I love all prog from 70s Yes , Genesis , King Crimson , ELP , to 80s Rush -LRB- arguably not prog , but still really tight and musically engaging -RRB- , to 90s progmetal of Dream Theater , Fates Warning , Pain of Salvation ... the list goes on , all great bands . But there 's one thing I despise about SOME -LRB- not all -RRB- prog fans . Even though this is supposed to be the genre of creativity , bounderyless thinking , freedom of music , and experimentation , some get it in their heads that it 's not good if it is easy to get into quickly . `` Real music must take time and thought to get into '' , and ok , there 's definitely truth in that , SOME of my favorite stuff took a while to get into , some did not . I think in many ways , the best music has a complexity that makes the music listenable forever , but at the same time , has great melodies and hooks that keep you coming back . These two things are n't opposites and are n't mutually exclusive , in fact , in the best works , they even coexist at the same time ! This is one of those works . Accused by many prog fans to be more popish , simply because it has GREAT MELODIES!Come on you guys -LSB- ... -RSB- , the progressive spirit is n't lacking in this work , it 's stronger than ever . I feel `` Kindness of Strangers '' really lacked great melodies . Yeah it was progressive and complex , but there was nothing there to make me WANT to unravel the complexity and delve into the work very deeply , I mean , why would I want to unravel a complex work if I ca n't even `` get into it '' ? And bottom line , who cares of it 's `` great prog '' , it 's `` great music '' that has a very well thought out cohesiveness and variety . I happen to really like `` Skin '' , it 's a very well written song with a great chorus , interesting bridge sections , and mood changes . Who cares if it 's only 3 and a half minutes long ? If a song can say all that it wants to say in 3 minutes , that 's fine with me ! `` The Healing Colors of Sound '' is sort of an epic , yes , that 's clear from the reprised songs and tie-ins between tracks , but in actuality , you will notice that they actually do n't title it as one work . It is a string of shorter songs , it 's not exactly meant to be one song the way `` The Great Nothing '' or `` The Light '' are , but it 's a great way to make a 22 minute section of music remain very much alive and continuous , while at the same time , maintaining individuality between tracks.Now , this said , I still do n't think this is Spock 's Beard 's greatest , I think I 'll give that honor to their latest , `` V '' , which is a virtually flawless album , and their debut `` The Light '' for the same reason . There are some tracks on DfN that are not very good , but thankfully , they are some of the shortest tracks on the album . I 'm not impressed with Gibberish , which is another Gentle Giant-esque tune with similarities to `` Thoughts '' off Beware of Darkness , but is much less interesting . `` I Ca n't Get it Wrong '' is easily their least interesting ballad -LRB- these guys are incredible at writing great ballads that contain no cheese -RRB- , and although `` The Distance to the Sun '' has some great moments , they 've done better ballads.The really beautiful ballad gem of this album is `` Lay it Down '' , which is probably their most beautiful ballad to date , excluding `` We All Need Some Light '' off the Transatlantic debut album -LRB- technically not Spock 's Beard , but pretty damn close -RRB- , so I should say it 's Neal Morse 's second best ballad to date . Day for Night is a great almost mini-epic with an uplifting melody and great keyboard work , `` Crack the Big Sky '' reminds me of `` Go the Way you Go '' off `` The Light '' for it 's jazz oriented sections , a funky , and very proggy tune . `` The Gypsy '' is a quirky , fun tune with hilarious -LRB- though odd -RRB- lyrics . `` Mommy Comes Back '' has some of the funniest vocoder work I 've ever heard , while the final two tracks serve as a great climax , and dramatic closing of the album . I really like how they took two choruses from two different songs in `` The Healing Colors ... '' and put them together at the end , very creative.Bottom line , there 's nothing to fear about this album , it 's not going to turn you into a `` Boyz II Men '' -LSB- fan -RSB- or suddenly make you like Brittany Spears , it 's just a great progressive album with great melodic structure . - Eric
 After three albums of 10 - 20 minute epics , the Beard is growing short . And to great effect . This whole disc is packed full of potent prog-pop tracks that pack a -LSB- heck -RSB- of a punch . The title track will have you singing along with the first listen . `` The Gypsy '' has a catchy chorus that will stick with you for weeks . The soulful groove of `` My Shoes '' will pull you deep into the Beard 's energy force.But this album , though hook laden and inherently `` feel-good '' is no pop album . The challengeing vocal harmonies of `` Gibberish '' will make your head spin and the epic qualities of `` Crack the Big Sky '' will move your soul and sometimes , your feet . This disc is a delicious unification of prog inventiveness and quirkiness mixed with brilliant pop sensebilities and energetic freshness.Another great quality about the Beard is Neal Morse 's voice - quite possible the freshest sounding , most distince prog vocalist of the decade . It 's a voice or warmth and character , of subtle texture , like fine sandpaper . And with versatility you would not beleive - this guy could sing any style and get away with it . A song like `` Ca n't Get it Wrong '' would come off as sappy , elevator-worthy tripe if any other artist attempted it . But Morse 's voice makes the song powerful and moving.The track , `` Lay it Down , '' however , is one that the album could 've done without . With the energy and soul that the rest of the album possesses , this boring , unmemorable track just gets in the way . But that is just a small complaint.The beatiful acoustics of the melancholy `` Distance to the Sun , '' the funk-inflected power pop-rock groove of `` Mommy Comes Back '' , and rest of this brilliant prog-pop album make it a sure winner with fans of prog and pop alike . Keep an open mind , and this album with not disappoint .
 The number one entry in most critics ' hate parade , progressive rock -LRB- or `` prog '' -RRB- has long been the pariah of rock music . Though the sneers of critics are sometimes deserved , the truth is that prog offered some undeniably memorable moments and planted the seed for many a critic 's darling in today 's scene -LRB- e.g. , Smashing Pumpkins , Catherine Wheel , Radiohead -RRB- . The problem with some prog pioneers -LRB- Yes comes to mind -RRB- is that often their need to experiment trumped their emphasis in songwriting . The results can be seen in albums as sneer-worthy as `` Tales from Topographic Oceans . '' Do n't get me wrong , however . When Yes focused on songwriting , they could be brilliant -LRB- e.g. , And You And I , Roundabout , Owner of a Lonely Heart -RRB- . These flashes of brilliance are the element of Yes that Spock 's Beard have incorporated into their music.But of all the prog pioneers , the band that arguably put the most emphasis in songwriting -LRB- and , consequently , became the most successful -RRB- is the one that most clearly influenced vocalist / guitarist / keyboardist / songwriter Neil Morse
 As a longtime fan of Yes , I first heard of this band from the `` recommendations '' link here on Amazon.com . This album was my first exposure to Spock 's Beard , and I can definitely say that it -LRB- and they -RRB- are worth a serious listen . Their melodic sound will certainly bring other classic `` prog '' bands to mind -LRB- it only occasionally borders on nostalgia -RRB- , but they have a character all their own.I read the previous review with interest and some amusement . Honestly , how an you make such statements if you admit to listening to only the first minute of each song ? This type of music is always bewtter with repeated listenings , when its complexity and vision can gradulaly make their impressions upon the listener . I wonder if the previous reviewer would have liked The Yes Album at first if he/she had only given each track one minute 's chance?At any rate , he/she does make one valid criticism
 I think it is interesting that people say Spock 's Beard tried to go more commercial with this album . The Beard has always involved a very identifiable pop element to their music -- big choruses , catchy hooks . I do n't find the music any simpler than on previous records , but it 's true the songs are generally shorter -LRB- lengthy tracks are commonly associated with prog , ya know -RRB- . Still , there is the amazing `` The Healing Colors of Sound '' epic suite that 's over 20-minutes long . It features the Beard 's familiar epic style ... songs within a song , wrapped together by recurring themes . The individual parts of this suite are very strong , be it the rockin ' hooks of `` Mommy Comes Back '' , the sad ballad `` Lay It Down '' , or the inspiring `` Healing Colors of Sound '' section , which never fails to put a smile on my face . Spock 's Beard 's music makes me feel good about life.Maybe some people perceive this album as `` poppier '' because has an ordinary pop ballad , `` Ca n't Get It Wrong '' and a fairly simple upbeat cut `` Skin '' . But the rest does n't seem like much of a digression from the band 's style . `` Crack the Big Sky '' is big song rife with ear-catching instrumental melodies , a huge singable chorus , and little tempo changes to keep you on your toes . -LRB- Hand claps too ! -RRB- `` The Distance to the Sun '' is a beautiful ballad that proves Neal Morse 's unmatched talent of tugging at your emotions . `` Gibberish '' is the requisite `` zany track , '' with funky vocal counterpoints a la Gentle Giant and a guitar riff that 's best described as crazy ! The title track that kicks off the album is good fun too , including the omnipresent Beardian -LRB- new word -RRB- hooks and savory , monster Rickenbacker bass lines . I like this whole album!Like all the Beard 's work , Day for Night is fun , addictive progressive music that I never grow tired of . My only problem is that they divided up the `` Healing Colors of Sound '' suite into eight separate tracks . Eck . I hate that -LRB- I like to play lots of my albums on `` shuffle '' or `` random '' -RRB- . But if that 's my only complaint , I think Spock 's Beard is doing okay .
 I have yet to be disappointed in anything done by Spocks Beard . Their songs are beautifully constructed and the musicianmanship/vocals are superb . You ca n't help but listen to this group and hear a uniquely American expression of the genius of Gentle Giant . Spocks Beard successfully blends elements of rock , fusion and classical sensibilities .
 I 'll just make a quick review of this album . The first times I played it I was disappointed . It was n't much else than the title track `` Day for Night '' that sounded like I 'm used to from their other albums `` Beware of Darkness '' and `` V '' . However , after a week I got into it , and now I really like it . Still , I ca n't give it more than 4 stars , not very much that it 's bad , more because their other records are better.This album is slightly different from the other and I would n't recommend you to start off with record . As I mentioned earlier , BoD and V are the best so far .
 This is my first Spock 's Beard CD . Let 's just say that they blew me away . I have been a long time fan of groups like Kansas , Yes , Rush , etc. . I was getting discouraged that I could n't find a good new progressive band to listen to . Well , I just found them . This CD has great musicianship and is just a blast to listen to . I plan on getting there other CDs based on this one .
 I 've listened this band the other night for first time , opening for Dream Theater 's Metropolis 2000 in Madrid . I liked them so much , so I bought their last record -LRB- this one -RRB- there . Good keyboards , good drums , inventive guitar and a Yes-sounding bass . But this is not enough to make a good record . And this is a good record beacuse it also has good SONGS . Neal Morse
 Spock progresses -LRB- sic -RRB- . Their `` prog '' influences are very much evident , however , this album is a bit more `` commercially accessible '' than the last . -LRB- No I 'm not in advertising -RRB- . Definitely a band to watch out for ... any moment now ...
 This is a fantastic work ! I feel like this might be one of the high-water marks of the Beard 's career ! It 's almost as good as Beware of Darkness , but has styles much more all-over-the-map and is a great intro to ANY Beard novice .
 This is a damn-near perfect marriage of intricate , progressive arrangements and pop hooks . Virtuostic musicianship that keeps mindless showboating to a minimum , endlessly engaging melodies and Neal Morse 's excellent songs and great singing have put this in my CD player almost once a day since I got it . I 'm unfortunately unfamiliar with their other albums , but if they 're all this good that 's gon na change , and soon . Highly recommended .
 Spock 's Beard is truly the future of Prog Rock . This is an excellent album . The opening track `` Day for Night '' jumps out at you kinda like `` Watcher of the Skies '' by Genesis , -LRB- the greatest band that ever was -RRB- and the middle of `` Gypsy Kings '' sort of reminds me of that new prog band IZZ -LRB- also an excellent band -RRB- . All in all do n't pass this CD up . Its wonderful !
 I discovered Spock 's Beard with the release of their last CD , `` Kindness of Strangers '' . I immediately bought the first two CD 's by the group , still in disbelief that this band has not made it big yet in the USA . And now another CD , `` Day for Night '' , has arrived , and is simply amazing . Its all in here - great vocals , great musicianship , and most importantly , great songwriting and arranging . This is the best band on the planet . Their music is diverse - one can certainly hear the influences of the Beatles , Gentle Giant , Yes , and Kansas . However , what the Beard has created is a totally unique and creative blend of great music which is all their own . All four of the studio CD 's are fantastic , with the new one being perhaps the best one yet . Every fan of creative music needs to hear Spock 's Beard . I can not imagine anyone not being blown away ! I have also seen them live and they are just as good in concert . Spread the word - the Beard is out there !!
 Some good reviews here . I 'd just like to chime in and say that I agree with the some listener 's lament about a certain lack of cohesion on this album . Intermixed with glorious prog moments are little diddies that , at once sound like the theme song for the feel-good movie of the year -LRB- Skin -RRB- , and at other times , boy-band ballads -LRB- peppered through the album -RRB- . OK , the boy-band thing was harsh ! I love SB , it 's just that about 30 % of this CD is ... `` frustrating '' - as another reviewer put it . Buy up some other SB disks before you get this one . If you are new to SB but love prog , try `` The Light '' and `` V '' . Thanks for reading .
 Initially I held off purchasing this CD because of the negative reviews . Typically the positive ones are fans that will enjoy almost anything their favorite band puts out . To the point , this is a much better album than expected.Songs like Day For Night , Crack The Big Sky , The Gypsy are more along the lines of what many listeners came to expect from Spock 's Beard . The musicianship and songwriting quality are immediately noticible.The song that seems to draw the most ire , Ca n't Get It Wrong is a well written/performed power ballad . The complaints about it not being progressive are silly . Compare it to what passes for ballads in contemporary music . The casual non-progressive listener would still find this song `` weird '' . The Healing Power Of Sound suite is listed as seperate songs . Not every Spock 's Beard CD has to have a 20 minute song on it.There are some songs I do n't find interesting , neither are they terrible . It 's nice to see a band try new things even if it appears to be an attempt to reach a wider audience . That 's not selling out when the vast majority of the CD has good music on it . Anyway , what 's the point to debating it when none of us can really say what the band had in mind?Ok , so what 's good?As mentioned the extended songs are great.Songs like Day For NightCrack The Big SkyThe Gypsy ... all are engaging and coherent . The shorter songs show Neal Morse developing into an excellent songwriter using a terse style that started developing on The Kindness of Strangers CD which is tied with V as my favorite albums by SB . The songs on Day For Night at times are lighter and not as complex technically but they are well written and performed.While Gibberish may be retreading old ground it is still enjoyable . The thing that makes this CD a paradox is it 's progression of ability . It goes in a slightly different direction which displeases some that want one specific style of music while others appreciate the continuing songwriting development -LRB- at times more traditional than progressive . -RRB- I 'd assert the V album would not be as good as it is without the development from this CD.One area of critisim ... guitarist Alan Morse seems to have fallen in love with his effects processors . He 's up in the mix and a lot of the effects used are already cliche . He also seemingly shreds more on this album which is to bad as he 's a great guitarist when playing lyrically . There are instances of his lyricism on the album like the solo at the end of My Shoes Revisited.Not their best but far better than most music being made .
 Different from previous Beard albums in it 's more standard-issue songlengths , Day For Night is nevertheless a fine album . Perhaps the most melodic of all their releases , it also features some of Neil Morse 's finest singing , and large contributions from Al Morse on guitar , with the usual keyboard and drum mastery . The best cuts include the opening title track , with it 's revolving bassline and keyboards . Other winners include Crack The Big Sky , The Gypsy , and The Healing Colors of Sound and My Shoes pieces . The `` Revisited '' My Shoes track features perhaps Al Morse 's greatest ever guitar solo . As I mentioned before , Neil 's vocals are above even his own high standard on this album , as tracks like Lay It Down , The Distance To The Sun , and others prove . Although not their best album -LRB- which is probably their latest release , V -RRB- this belongs in the collection of any Spock 's Beard or neo-prog fan .
 Spock 's Beard is the best progressive rock band to burst onto the schene since the music 's heyday in the 70s . With Day For Night , the band has made its most fully realized album yet . Incredible musicianship and songwriting meld seamlessly into a listening experience unlike any other in contemporary rock . If you enjoy beautiful melody , virtuoso technical mastery of instruments , amazing vocal harmonies , thought-provoking lyrics , and great pop mixed in with the intricate musical passages characteristic of prog , Spock 's Beard is a must-have , and so is DFN , their best album to date .
 Spocks beard es un gran grupo de rock progresivo , aunque algunos , por ah&iacute; lo cataloguen de pop ; tiene un estilo muy propio que se ha establecido con el tiempo . Cabe destacar la gran t&eacute;cnica de este grupo a la hora de utilizar los contratiempos , cosa que no hacen en el pop , sino en el exquisito rock que nos muestra SB.Este album en particular es , a mi juicio otra de las obras maestras de SB , despu&eacute;s de Kidness of Stragers , me vuelven a sorprnder con la magnifica voz de Neal Morse , poniendo fuerza y armon&iacute;a a cada uno de los temas de Day For Night.Realmente lo aconsejo y le doy mis 5 estrellas , se lo merecen los SB , pasando por su mejor tiempo musical .
 First of all , if this is your first forray into Spock 's Beard and the renaissance of progressive rock , this CD is a great intro into the talents of the band . Except for a couple of semi-weak songs -LRB- `` Ca n't Get it Wrong '' and `` Gypsy '' -RRB- , this album stands up quite well.When I first heard Spock 's Beard , it was through the free download of `` Gibberish '' from this CD . I have learned much since then about the band.I give this 4 stars because of the self-absorbed , Styx/ELO-like `` Ca n't Get It Wrong '' and the vocal tone Morse assumes occassionally is a bit nasally for my ears -LRB- but light-years better than Dream Theatre 's lead vox -RRB- . For this effort , Spock 's Beard trimmed up their sound to a tight , well-arranged combo pressing out solid licks and fairly intelligent intro segments . The 10-minute `` Crack the Big Sky '' seems to take only 3 minutes to hear ... the songs are listenable and easily approachable to the uninitiated.The massive multi-song compilation-piece of `` The Healing Colors of Sound '' that closes this album foreshadows the upcoming concept work , `` Snow '' , a CD worth investigating.The Beard provide shades of classic 70 's progressive bands -LRB- without sounding contrived or simply a `` lifting '' of other artist 's ideas -RRB- mixed into their own -LRB- Neal Morse 's -RRB- original sound.Other albums to consider with this CD : Spock 's Beard
 Day For Night is the 4th album from Spock 's Beard and is almost the `` forgotten '' Beard album of the Neal Morse-era . Everyone knows the first three and everyone knows V and Snow , but Day For Night seems to be constantly overlooked . And that 's a damn shame , as it 's a fantastic album . While it does n't have a few long songs like previous albums did , it has a lot of excellent 4-9 minute tunes and a 20 minute suite closing the album . The playing and singing , as always , is top notch ... in short , this album should NOT be forgotten in the Beard 's catalog!It starts off with the excellent title track and weaves its way through fantastic songs like Gibberish , Skin , Crack the Big Sky , the very pretty acoustic-based Distance to the Sun , before closing with the mammoth suite The Healing Colors of Sound , which is incredible . The title-track instrumental leads into the rockin ' My Shoes , the grooving Mommy Comes Back , Lay it Down , which is a gentle , quiet section , before the reprise of the title-track song and the My Shoes finale . Just amazing.This would also be a great Beard album to get if you 're starting to get into them -LRB- any of the first 4 albums would be good ones to start with -RRB- .
 Some think it 's too poppy , specially because of Ca n't Get it Wrong . However , if you get songs like Day For Night , Healing Colors of Sound , Crack The Big Sky and The Gypsy , you 'll see there 's a little for everyone
 You know what makes the best `` prog '' rock experiences ? It 's the marriage of the sly pop hook with the instrumental chops to back it up . Look at some of the best Yes cuts -LRB- `` Starship Trooper , '' `` Roundabout , '' `` And You And I '' -RRB- and Genesis -LRB- `` I Know What I Like , '' `` Supper 's Ready , '' `` Entangled '' -RRB- . They all have some cool hooks stuck in there . Where `` prog '' faulters is when the hooks are n't there like on Yes 's `` Tales From Topographic Oceans '' or ELP 's `` Pictures at an Exhibition . `` I do n't know why there are SO many detractors from this album . I think this is a far cry better than several other Spock 's Beard offerings because of the committment to the hook and some superior writing . `` Skin , '' `` Day For Night , '' and `` Crack the Big Sky '' all feature great writing , hooks and excellent playing . What else could you ask for ? If you are looking for an updated take on `` prog '' like 70 's Yes , Genesis and King Crimson but want to avoid the road taken by groups like Asia , check out this CD!Then check out a few more by Porcupine Tree while you 're at it !
 This is a great CD . I have n't heard progressive rock like this in many years . One thing I really like about the CD is that even though the band members are obviously very talented musicians , they never lose sight of writing good songs and melodies - not self-indulgent . I was very pleasantly surprised , and will have to check out the rest of their CDs now .
 Having loved prog rock since the ' 70 's I thought it was a dying genre but lo and behold ! Enter Spock 's Beard . I get those same goosebumps as the the first time I heard `` Foxtrot '' . What a delight ... Spock 's Beard is fresh , innovative and well ... progressive !
 I consider this Beard 's `` Fragile '' before their `` Close to the Edge '' , `` V '' . They 've finally gotten their sound down and have perfected the arrangements . Neal Morse is definately the wizard behind the group and is outstanding as song writer , vocalist , and musician . If you 're into prog rock , this is a definate buy .
 Well , there 's one that 's almost 10 minutes , and there 's a `` hidden '' one that 's really listed as six tracks -- `` The Healing Colors Of Sound -LRB- part 1 -RRB- '' thru `` My Shoes -LRB- revisited -RRB- : '' . That medley is just as unified as `` The Water '' on an earlier album , and it runs over 20 minutes like that one . I guess they just did n't give it an overall title . But you do get the same progressive sound that falls somewhere between the traditional prog style as done by Marillion and the new harder-edged style of Dream Theater . These guys are a bit too good for the minor label they 're on , but maybe that 's not such a bad thing -- major label acts often end up mainstreaming their sound . The only trouble is that not every store carries them , so not enough people know who they are . Well , there 's one way to handle that . Do like I do -- get this album , get their others , and drop their name all over the place . Word of mouth is how the original generation of prog got rolling , after all .
 Having slowly but surely getting the whole Beard library , I have noticed there is not one bad album in their library . Yeah , some where better than others but as a whole this band is one of the best , if not the best band I have heard in this century.This album does not have a bad song on it . Favorites are Day For Night , Crack the Big Sky , and of course The whole Healing Colors of sound . What I liked about this album is the energy and drive with each song . The craftman ship and musicianship of this album is perfect . I can recommend this album for those who are curious about the band and for those who love progressive rock . Yes , it is not as good as Snow , but it is a solid effort from this underrated band .
 I like the analogy to `` Fragile '' on a prior review.Although the first three discs are all worth spinning , on `` Day For Night '' the band really comes into its own , having defined their sound and found their niche somewhere south of the harder-edged Dream Theater.Neal Morse has stepped forward as the wizard behind the group and drives the sound as song writer and vocalist.While their fifth album , named `` V '' strangely enough , is in my opinion the masterpeice of the Neal Morse era , this one teed them up as the American prog band to look out for.This disc should be on any prog snob 's shelf !
 Of the band 's Neal Morse era albums this one is probably my least favorite . That being said I love everything Spock 's Beard has done and I enjoy pretty much every song on here to some extent . The band blatantly tried to write a hit single with the track `` Skin '' . They even filmed a video for it that received pretty much zero airplay . The track `` Ca n't Get It Wrong '' is a pretty straight forward attempt at a commercial power ballad too . The song is very vanilla sounding for Spock 's Beard . Some of the band 's fans cried sell out at this stab at commerciality , but although the album is a bit more straightforward I have never thought the sellout tag was a fair one . I think this album does contain a bit more `` average '' material than most Beard albums . Songs like `` Crack The Big Sky '' are ok , but nothing that is really memorable either . The highlights are the title track that starts the album out , and A really nice ballad in `` The Distance To The Sun '' with more very pleasant vocal harmonies from Neal and Nick . The big epic on this one is for some reason broken up into 6 different parts , but is effectively `` The Healing Colors Of Sound '' . Like `` Flow '' from the last album I do n't think this one is quite as strong as the long epics on the first 2 discs , but it is still very good . I especially like the `` When Mommy Come 's Back '' section of the piece . Overall I think this is the weakest of the Neal Morse era albums , but I still really enjoy it and think it ranks a solid 4 stars .
 ... ` Day for Night ' really gets you going , and the subsequent ` Skin ' and ` Distance to the Sun ' are classics.This band is uneven in it 's delivery at times , however knowing full well where the influences are ... I respect them for keeping the progressive rock theme and spirit going , tossing away the commercial ... Some great progessive rock that is all their own . At times this CD may drag , but they pull it together in the end -LRB- the ` shoes ' suite -RRB- . Some folk hate Neal Morse 's voice , but as long as he does n't stretch it too far beyone his real capabilities , he sounds great . It is hardly an offensive one ... - one that you can easily associate with smooth , prog rock . ...
 Friends , Romans , Countrymen and everyone else ... you must have this cd in your collection . As the third part of the elite triumvirate of prog rock , along with DT and Flower Kings , the Beard is the cherry on top of the modern prog sundae . Sweet sweet sweet . A must on this years list for Santa .
 Now mind you , Pop/Rock is garbadge . People complain about the exponential number of post-hardcore/hardcore with simliar bands that have clones and are a disgrace to music . Well , pop punk seems to be lacking clones , mostly becuase most of the bands suck in their own special way.Fortunatly , this is not the case for Boys Like Girls . Dumb name ? Yes . But it 's appropriate for it 's High School romance like lyrics and sound . A bad thing ? Only if you 're one of those people with a musical royalty stick up your butt.Now , there is n't really a terrible song off this ablum , it 's extremely catchy , they 've mastered the art of the hook . But then again , so has most rap artists , so that 's not saying much . None the less , I 'm struggling to think of a pop/rock band better then them at the moment . They seem really in their element and for a debut , their experience level and ability to write quality music is beyond their years . Expect them to sell out soon . Until then , pick this up .
 I bought this album last summer -LRB- August of 06 -RRB- after hearing Thunder on their myspace and seeing Hero-Heroine on Youtube . Since , I 've seen them in concert twice -LRB- I highly recommend it , Martin is amazing live -RRB- and they 've become the darlings of radio and MTV.It 's a great about-town album , something fun to put on that 'll keep you happy and not likely to murder stupid drivers in front of you.The Great Escape - 8.5 / 10 - Their second single , a really catchy made-for-radio song . Good.Five Minutes to Midnight - 9.0 / 10 - one of my favorite to sing along to . Flows well.Hero / Heroine - 9.0 / 10 - If I was n't sick of hearing it all the time , the rating would probably be higher . A very light , airy song . Really goodOn Top of The World - 8.0 / 10 - Not a bad song , but not one of my favorites either.Thunder - 9.5 / 10 -LRB- album version -RRB- 10/10 -LRB- acoustic version -RRB- - Their first song they wrote together . The ballad song of the album , it 's about a summer love , and missing her . Fantastic song , the acoustic version is one of my favorite songs.Me , You , and My Medication - 7.5 / 10 - It 's okay , I just feel it 's waily at some points.Up Against the Wall - 8.0 / 10 - probably the least listened to song on the album for me . Martin sounds different , it 's more brooding . Not bad , though.Dance Hall Drug - 9.5 / 10 - Really fun , really catchy , and really fun . I love it.Learning to Fall - 9.0 / 10 - The lyrics are kinda sad , it 's about getting over being dumped and seeing her with another man.Heels Over Head - 10/10 - My favorite . The chorus can be sung over and over , and I would n't care . Also about being left by a loved one.Broken Man - 8.5 / 10 - Something is different about this song . I ca n't place it , but it 's not bad anyhow.Holiday - 9.0 / 10 - Slower , but good.All in all , I 'd give the album a 9.5 / 10 . It 's fun , catchy , and has a great beat . I 'm always smiling after I listen to it . I wholeheartedly recommend it .
 My friend loves this band so rather than just listen to his CD I got my own . Good thing . It 's been on my play list for days and I ca n't get the songs out of my head . The band is full of energy , yet their lyrics are deep , down-to-earth and resonate with real-life situations . `` Thunder '' is by far my favorite song , followed by `` Holiday '' and `` The Great Escape . '' However , no song on this album deserves to be skipped . I highly recommend it .
 What I like best is the vocals are pitch perfect , as is instrument tuning , making the chords more emotive . Lots of effort went into this recording . Strong crisp percussion like Foo Fighters -- some melodies like Unwed Sailor -LRB- high praise -RRB- . How in the world can this alblum have so few reviews ?
 LOVE THIS BAND AND WISH THEM NOTHING BUT SUCCESS AS THEY START OUT . EXCELLENT CD , NO DISAPPOINTMENTS
 It 's an amazing CD . By far Thunder is my favorite song , but its definitely worth the buy ! I can listen to it straight through , which I do constantly !
 The CD came in on time and the details given on the items were precise .
 I 'd never heard of boys like girls , but I was lucky enough to hear a song by We the Kings , and I came on amazon to check them out , and saw some people comparing them to Boys like girls , so without even listening to any songs , I just decided to buy that CD as well.I was really surprised by how good it was ! I have n't been able to stop listening to it and it 's been like 5 months ! The songs are really catchy but in a more understated way . I 'd say `` 5 minutes to midnight is the most punk with the riffs and melody etc , and the rest of the CD I 'm not quite sure how I 'd classify it . Maybe pop-punk/emo ... somewhere along those lines.Unlike some reviews which said that `` The great escape '' was the only good song , I highly highly disagree and I 'm shocked that anyone would think that . Through and through , this is one of the most consistent CDs I 've heard in terms of the quality of the tracks as a whole . Besides `` me , you and my medication '' and `` dance hall drug '' , I 'd say it 's really hard to pick favourites , but if I had to
 I liked the song hero/Herion and i decided that i would buy the cd to get the 2 or 3 songs i liked . i put the cd into my laptop and started to listen . I loved every song ! When i usulay buy a cd i like 3 or 4 songs but on this one i love ever single song !! I would recomend this to anyone . If you want to get a good cd for yourself or someone else you should get it !!
 I love this album has lots of great beats to it and you can easily sing along after listening to it a couple of times .
 Love the Album , love the band . I think it is a great rock CD . Really enjoy listening to the first five or six tracks but the rest of the CD is good too .
 While Boys Like Girls isnt as unique as it can be as far as emo bands are concerned , this album can very well be the album of the year -LRB- 2008 -RRB- . I 've been on the search for a great emo band for years ever since Something Corporate stopped producing more music and this album answered my prayer . Sorry Dashboard Confessional - I like your album but it just doesnt seem to fill the void I had .
 While watching NFL Total Access they played part of `` The Great Escape '' liked it , I went to Amazon heard samples of all the songs and bought the album . It just arrived and immediately played it . Great music , it is very refreshing to see new groups and especially talented ones . This reminds me of when `` Cold Play '' began . All the songs in this CD are great full of life and good messages . I highly recommended to ALL !!!
 The lead singer 's voice is really an acquired taste . However , there are many artists I like that do n't have the best voices so it 's all good . This CD has a mix of upbeat pop rock anthems to way slow and tender songs that get you in the mood to sway back and forth or just think . In the beginning of the CD he really stretches his voice and the songs are generally louder . Towards the end I believe some of the songs are more relaxed . The disc has a mixture of sounds like I said ; fast , mid-tempo and slow but I find that his vocals are best on the slower songs where he is n't pushing his voice so hard . This CD is pretty good if you let it warm up to you and appreciate the differences some of the songs bring . My favorite ones are `` Great Escape '' , `` Holiday '' , `` On Top Of The World '' and `` Hero/Heroine '' . Buy this today if you like pop rock music with the emo sound . It 's not too angsty though . It 's generally upbeat .4.2 stars .
 There 's something to be said about an album where I can actually listen to every song . It 's really unique , because it 's like there 's a different song to fit my mood everytime it changes . I love Boys Like Girls !
 The guy who said they were unoriginal was partially right , but just in the sense that this style has been around for a while . They songs have good lyrics and the band sounds great . They sound like Mae kicked up a notch . So Or The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus turned down a couple notches . Either way these guys are solid.This CD is easy to listen to all the way through on the first play , which sometimes means it will get easy to get bored with after a while . I guess we 'll see , but I still them 4.5 stars .
 This album was a little more emo than I 'm used to but It 's real cool . there is the S-word in tracks 10 and 11 so if you do n't like cussing watch out for those two.The Great Escape - We 've all heard it on the radio . If you like this song the rest of the songs are very similar .10 / 10Five Minutes to Midnight - Very similar to an All-American Rejects song . I like it a lot .10 / 10Hero/Heroine - A lot of people can probably relate to this song . It 's real good .9 / 10On top of the world - This track is more up-beat and happy than some other songs . It 's a good pick-me-up song .8 / 10Thunder - AMAZING song . Very mellow . It 's about a summer romance that he does n't want to end .10 / 10Me you and my Medication - Not my favorite . Very different from the other songs . weird7/10Up against the wall - perhaps my favorite song on the album . The whole song captures many elements of a solid rock songs .8 / 10Dance Hall Drug - The message is do n't grow up too fast . This is also a very solid rock song .10 / 10Learning to Fall - Very sad song . This guy 's in love with this girl and she blows him off and goes to some other guy . Very relate-able song .8 / 10Heels over head and broken Man - S-word so I do n't listen to them .1 / 10Holiday - The Grand Finale of the album . It is the perfect finish .9 / 10Overall these guys made a sweet album that shows a lot of potential.The album is a 10/10 . - Please say if this helped you out . Peace out
 What a diamond in the rough this turned out to be ! I went to the Butch Walker show in Minneapolis back in August not having a clue who Boys Like Girls were and half-way through their opening song I was hooked . They had a very good stage presence and I got to meet Martin afterwards and it was just a very pleasant surprise.I then got this record to support them , not expecting a whole lot , but holy smokes was I in for a treat . There are about 8 really , really good tunes on here . None more than `` Heels over head '' and `` The Great escape '' . I hope these guys have some success and continue to make music . I really like this record and I think many others would too from various forms of rock/pop/emo / alt music .
 I have been listening to boys like girls since the album released , i have never heard them in concert , and have n't been following them since the day the were born , so my opinion is strictly one of a music lovers . i can not in good conscience call this band a 5 star band although the way some people rate music alround here i think i could easily justify it . However dispite a few minor debut flows that should be expected from a brand new band , i think the music flowing from this album is definitely unparrelleled from any other pop-rock band this year although some would say they are a knock off of cartel . Although somewhat similar , the vocals and hooks truly separate these two bands . If you do n't like pop-rock then do n't listen to the album and do n't review the album b/c your opinion is biased . I do n't go around rating polka albums , and im sure no one who like polka gives a crap about my opinion . The lyrics are somewhat high school , but i really do n't see a problem with that . Most bands lyrics relate to the current times and situations that have experienced , thats what makes the lyrics real . I 'm sure if they were all 40 they would be out singing with bono about world peace and their favorite traveling hats.Not all the songs are jaw-droppingly original but i would say the album as a whole has enough `` never heard that before '' type of stuff that it 's definitely worth a listen . Songs like `` Head Over Heels '' , `` HeroHeroine '' , and `` Five Minutes to Midnight '' are up-beat with quick-witted lyrics mixed in with deep passion . Songs like `` Thunder '' , `` On Top of the World '' , and `` Holiday '' are mostly about growing up and moving on two things that are easily relatable to . These songs are somewhat slower than the first 3 i mentioned but overall i think the album has a good balance . The other songs are not terrible but not super special either although i would probably give an honorable mention award to `` Up Against the Wall '' although it may be a little too heart-throb . Anyways check these guys out , if you like good music i 'm sure you 'll hang on to at least a couple of these songs for a long time .
 This debut album is a great buy !!! . If you 've never heard of them , get ready to enjoy some catchy tunes that almost everyone can relate to . Five Minutes to Midnight is my personal favorite , with Dance Hall Drug and Heels Over Head tied for a close second , but the entire album is very good , very catchy , and very listenable . Listen to this CD once and you 'll be singing along , moving your feet and just diggin ' the groove.Well Done BLG !!! . I 'm looking forward to hearing what 's next .
 There are only a few albums that I 've ever had that I could listen to over and over again . Boys Like Girls has been enthusiastically added to this list of musical glory . I do n't even recall where I stumbled across this band , but I thank God I did . Songs like `` Thunder '' , `` Hero/Heroin '' , and `` The Great Escape '' make my heart swell with emotion and an slow , constant drip of euphoria . The way the Martin 's -LRB- lead vocals -RRB- voice rises and peaks with the music is nothing short of amazing ! I can not praise this band enough for the work of art they 've created .
 This album is so infectious from start to finish ... the songs make me want to sing and dance and have fun ! And there are some songs that even pull at my heart strings , they have MEANING and they give me that fuzzy feeling in my tummy when I listen to them . Maybe you are the kind of person that does that when you hear something you really like , maybe not . But it ca n't be denied that these boys know what they 're doing and they 're good at it . Check it out ! You wo n't be let down ...
 I discovered this band through my 13 year old daughter and I can tell you that this band has a lot more depth and talent than many of those out there . To call it a `` boy band '' , `` emo '' or `` alternative '' really does this band a disservice . I think I like them better than my daughter which may be why they have n't hit the big time yet . Maybe they are targeting the wrong people ! After all , I want new music too and I am NOT cnotent to listen to re-releases of popular 80s songs performed by a bunch of has-beens in depends . This band actually has talent and they are n't afraid to experiment with it . When I listen to it I am reminded of the Outfield from the 80s , except with the talent of early U2 . If they keep going the direction they are now they probably wo n't make it `` big '' as fast as some of these other kid bands which is fine by me . Hopefully they 'll avoid that path and continue developing their skills and talents into the far future . After all , it took U2 10 years and 5 albums to get something in the number one spot . Either way , I almost never write reviews but this one was worth me taking the time to actually sit here and write this . If you are over 30 and have been longing for a new band with talent , a good melody , and that feel generated by the Outfield and other similar bands you 'll be thrilled with this CD .
 Saw these guys open for Butch Walker in Boston a couple months ago and they played a nice set . Since I liked what I heard I picked up the album . Good stuff , give it a listen .
 I have n't purchased this CD yet , but I 've listened to every song on it and they 're all good . The CD is on my wish list . This enhanced disk contains the AOL Under Cover acoustic versions of Great Escape , Thunder -LRB- first song Martin and Paul wrote together and a poignant ballad -RRB- , and a cover of Frou Frou 's Let Go . I like these acoustic versions better than the originals . The mix on them is excellent , Paul and Martin 's voices blend beautifully , and the guitar playing is wonderful . Sure hope to find this in my Christmas stocking .
 I took my kids to see The All American Rejects . These guys opened for AAR along with two other bands . They were by far the best of the three opening acts . I was impressed , so I bought the cd . Good cd . See them live if you have a chance . Well worth it . If you like Simple Plan and AAR , you will like these guys .
 I do n't normally like fast , upbeat music but this album blew me away . From start to finish these guys bring so much energy to each song . There is n't one I do n't like and that alone says a lot for any album .
 If you liked the great escape you 'll love the cd . All the songs are just as good . Saw them in concert and they are awesome !!!! 5 minutes to midnight is a great track and plenty of others ... BUY IT !!
 When i found this Cd i was so excited because i fell in love with the song , `` Thunder '' for it 's romanticness and the rest of the CD IS INCREDIBLE > Upbeat , fun and very very catchy ! I have it all memorized !!! It 's easy to relate to and to sing along to !! I love Be my escape , Hero/heroine and Thunder ~ ~ The whole cd is wonderful.Keep Rocking guys !
 I took my teenage daughter to an All-American Rejects concert and they band Boys Like Girls were an opening band . We all had never heard of them before , but loved their performance and their music . They even came out afterwards for autographs and pictures for the kids . Their music is incredible even for me as a mom . My daughter is definitely hooked on them and their music ...
 This is an amazing band even though they are more pop-ish than what I normally listen to . Can not wait to see them at warped tour this summer .
 I love every song on this album ! The lyrics and melodies are addicting . These guys are so talented . I ca n't wait for their next album !
 This band is amazing and they fit in so great with the music that is around today !! They are playing on march 22nd with cartel and cobra starship other bands you sould check out if you like boys like girls check out the tour dates for a city near you !
 Even though they saw fit to release most of these older Christian metal groups CDs as two CD sets , this is still worth buying . Tourniquet starts off with Stop the Bleeding and cuts it up from there . Granted , if you were n't much into the 80 's metal scene , you may not like the first CD . Guy Ritter sings better saprano than a lot of women I 've heard . Despite that , Lenair 's guitar playing , and Kirkpatrick 's drumming are something you just ca n't ignore . That in itself makes this CD worth it all . You Get What you Pray For was their single off of this one , and it is something you can jam to . Psycho Surgery sets the stage for some of their best work . Guy Ritter came down off the 80 's trip , for the most part , and really refined his voice . As for the rest of the band , they took what they knew how to do , and put out 110 % . I 'll admit I do n't know anything about how to describe a guitar player 's abilities , but there is some awesome stuff on this CD . There 's a guest apearance by PID on Spineless that takes you back to oldschool rap , and that 's pretty cool . Now , if you 're looking for anything beyond these two , you may have some trouble finding Pathogenic Occular Dissonance , which was Guy Ritter 's and Eric Mendez 's last CD with the band . As for the following albums , they should be no problem . For their best work without Ritter , look for Vanishing Lessons and Microscopic View of a Telescopic World , with Luke Easter at vocals . As for Crawl to China , well , that was n't the Tourniquet I 've ever known .
 I have a cassette tape of Tourniquet that recorded Sept 11,1990 by Intense Records.I 'm assuming this tape was recorded at the time they started recording.It 's a good tape , one of the best I 've heard in that year -LRB- 1990 -RRB- . I never thought that they made itcause I never found any of their cd 's . Now they have a 2 Disc cd for 50 bucks and more cd 's I was n't aware of.I find that this is the best tape or cd to hear.I would like to find out what this tape is worth .
 These are two of Tourniquet 's best albums , hands down . The ultra-technical guitars , the ` King Diamond-esque ' vocals , right down to the superior song writing ...
 I just became a Tourniquet fan recently and got their new Cd `` Microscopic View of a Telescopic Realm '' , but after that got old , I started going back and listening to their old stuff -LRB- which is really hard to find now ! -RRB- . STOP THE BLEEDING If you 've heard old Stryper or Bride albums , this one 's merely a duplicate . It rocks , but Guy Ritter 's high-pitched shrieking gets old . This album is too 80 's for Tourniquet . Why even feature those two musicians as part of the band when they did absolutely NOTHING on Stop the Bleeding ? PSYCHO SURGERY
 This is an album of bebop jazz . Really well performed - both technically and emotionally . I listen to a lot -LRB- of post 1950 -RRB- jazz and I have put this CD into my collection of ` to be played regularly ' . You wo n't confuse this album with Charlie Parker , but nor will you confuse is with Kenny G.
 Here 's another great , overlooked art-school-rock classic finally released on CD . It 's full of Ayers ' odd lyrics and twisted tunes , and features a host of former Soft Machine mates and Island Records chums getting together to make some loopy , off-kilter rock 'n' roll . Ayers ' dark vision might be mistaken for depression in songs like `` Do n't Let It Get You Down '' and `` Shouting In a Bucket Blues , '' but it 's always redeemed by a sense of humor and wit -LRB- `` When Your Parents Go To Sleep '' and `` Interview . '' -RRB- . The bonus tracks include `` Caribbean Moon , '' which had been available on the 1973 U.S. vinyl release . Fans of Soft Machine may be disappointed ; this is rock , not jazz . Along with his marvelous 1974 album `` Confessions of Doctor Dream , '' this is some of the Seventies ' most chic and sophisticated pop , as well as its most underrated .
 Kevin Ayers and the band 747 toured the Bananamour album in 1973 as Banana Follies and I was fortunate to see them at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on May 26th . The sleeve notes to this release mention that the preceding night 's QEH gig on the 25th was recorded for a possible live LP `` but Ayers ' performance proved lacklustre and the overall result proved too disappointing to release '' . Perhaps they recorded the wrong night as I remember no such shortcomings and it seemed as if Kevin Ayers was on the verge of major stardom.Although both the band and the material lacked the eccentricity and inspiration of his former outfit , the Whole World , it seemed that these concessions had made him and the band into more of a commercial proposition.This is also true of this album . The whole affair is very restrained in a rather deliberate and British fashion , and this works to good advantage on some of the numbers , such as the excellent Shouting In A Bucket Blues , which features Steve Hillage on guitar , though at times there are lyrical weaknesses , and whimsical tributes to Syd Barrett and Nico both fail to show real insight into their subjects . Overall , though , this is still a strong and idiosyncratic album . Archie Leggett is allowed a lead vocal on the soully mock-sinister When Your Parents Go To Sleep , with a horn section featuring Howie Casey , and Soft Machine buddy organist Mike Ratledge solos on Interview.Stardom failed to follow and Kevin 's next release was on the Island label.Of the bonus tracks , the highlight is a reggae reworking of old favourite Clarence In Wonderland , recorded with the band Greyhound , under the title Connie On A Rubber Band .
 I got this album in 1973-74 from a friend who worked at a radio station . It is the best free record I ever had , and is still one of my favorite records of all time . No two songs sound alike , yet there is no doubt that they are all the work of the same slightly off-kilter mind . `` Do n't Let It Get You Down '' is a slightly bluesy ballad with a comforting , upbeat message . `` When Your Parents Go To Sleep '' is a paean to to teen romance on the sly , with an absolutely divine horn arrangement , almost but not quite sloppy , as if a New Orleans brass band accompanied lustful encounters instead of funeral marches.Ayers was a contemporary of the early British Prog-rock scene . He was a founding member of Soft Machine , and a friend of Pink Floyd founder Syd Barret . Those influences are best heard on `` Decadence '' , a slow , moody tribute to avant-garde chanteuse Nico . It sounds vaguely like a Velvet Underground song , if Lou Reed had been a world-weary baritone instead of a nasally whiner . The instrumentation on this song , as throughout the album , is quirky and anthemic at the same time . Impeccable musicians back up Ayers , and even when it sounds silly , as on `` O ! wot a Dream '' one gets the feeling that all the players are taking it seriously . There are some great solos on the record , but every note is part of a greater whole.The record has a better-focused San Francisco-Summer-of-Love vibe , psychedelic with an unmistakably British point of view . And it sounds as fresh today as the first time I heard it .
 This music epitomises 1973 , optimistic , hairy , innocent . Superb harmonics are supplements to lucid lyric . Kevin was at his absolute best !
 From the days when music was music and not of a particular genre . The photo inside says it all
 I had the privelege of listening to this cd prior to the release . I have been trying to get Steve to come to our yearly youth group convention and needed to give the people in charge a sample of Steve 's music . The cd I gave them is a promotional copy of `` 100 % Saved '' . I have all of Three Crosses albums to date and I ca n't wait to get the finished product of this album . It is one of the best `` praise and worship '' albums that I have heard ; and , if you 're a Three Crosses fan , you will not be disappointed .
 A huge BRAVO for this real amazing treasure ! It compiles 25 of the most famous songs and melodies from 1910 to 1945 which played in the famous Ziegfeld Follies . You 'll find the voices of Bert Williams -LRB- in his popular `` Nobody '' -RRB- , the legendary Fanny Brice -LRB- and her N1 hit of those days `` My Man '' -RRB- , Maurice Chevalier , Eddie Cantor , Ruth Etting , Frances White , Will Rogers and others . Although they are mono recordings , the sound is very good , having that special sound texture of old times which makes it much more enjoyable . Certainly enough , this is a definite MUST for any Broadway collector or american musical historian . You 'll find here part of the origins of the Broadway legend , the most representative songs and tunes of old times that take us back to the past so that we may understand the present . This is worth every penny you invest on it . DO N'T MISS IT BY ANY CHANCE !
 I enjoy the casio beats and smooth lyrical genious . I wish amazon would sell this cd again . It is well worth it .
 If you have seen Teletubbies before , its the same edge of the seat heart thumping excitement -LRB- not ! -RRB- . But from my 10 month old daughter 's perspective , this is great stuff.The Teletubbies speak a little more than usual , and the seventy minutes of video has no repeats -LRB- prefaced by the famous `` Again ! Again ! '' -RRB- . A delightful adventure for anyone learning to watch television .
 Bright colors , slow pace , nice transitions , fun jazz band . Encourages napping , going to bed , and teaches manners when somebody else is sleeping . Shows a preschooler how to help care for a sibling . Great diversity . Good parent guide . Familiar music is a big hit . The kids loved singing along , doing the actions and dancing . They shouted when they saw their favorite characters . `` It was fun to look at . '' `` Teletubbies treat each other right . '' Repeating the live characters was a plus . Best for ages 0 to 2 .
 The Teletubbies are gentle and caring . I realize there was some controversy over the Teletubbies . However , I found them to teach sweet lessons of caring , watching over each other , gentleness and so on.This video is about going to bed and having sweet dreams . There are lullaby songs , short little segments that are typical of the other Teletubbies vidoes make this a good video to watch for five to ten minutes before turning off the TV . Manners for when someone is sleeping are demonstrated in one segment . Nothing is repeated which makes this a much more engaging video than the other Teletubbies videos.Enjoy .
 I am almost embarassed to admit it , but my daughter has 5 teletubbies videos . Of all of them , we both agree that this is the best one -LRB- and the only one her dad will actually sit through with her -RRB- . All of the `` real '' video sections keep her entertained , especially the opening song , `` Wake Up Sleepyhead , '' which is quite infectious . Not necessarily a `` bedtime '' video , but entertaining nonetheless .
 He has watched some or all of this at least once a day for several months . It actually has a couple of funny scenes for adults -LRB- like when they are crunching their tubby toast too loud while Dipsy is sleeping -RRB- .
 Great episodes and fun stories ! Do n't miss this title if you are a collector or a fan . Very sweet message wrapped up in classic Teletubbie cuteness .
 I ordered these for a birthday of an Autistic child . He is even comforted just carrying the cover around and loves to watch them as well .
 Colonial Traditions is a the finest album of Colonial-era tunes that I have heard in the last 10 years . The production qualities of the musical pieces and talents of the musicians will absolutely blow you away ! The beautifully blended insturmentation ranges from fiddle , cello , string bass , mandolin , hammered dulcimer , classical and steel-string guitar , accordian , recorder , flute , wood flute , Celtic harp , cintern , bodhran , bones , and triangle.The selection of tunes includes the well known Rose Tree/Over The Water Fall Medley , Barabara Allen , The Girl I Left Behind , St. Ann 's Reel , Fisher 's Hornpipe , and Gary Owen -LRB- Theme of Custer 's 7th Cavalry -RRB- . Lesser known but equally marvelous tracks on the album are the Blarney Pilgrim -LRB- a catchy tune featuring a fine accordian -RRB- , The Water Is Wide -LRB- a hauntingly beautiful arrangement blending fiddle , flute , hammered dulcimer , and guitar -RRB- , Going to Boston/On the Road to Boston Medley -LRB- a snappy feel-good melody carried by fiddle and hammered dulcimer -RRB- , I 'll Give My Love An Apple , I 'll Mend Your Pots and Kettles -LRB- an easy-going but peppy piece featuring fiddle , hammered dulcimer , and recorder -RRB- , and Come All Ye Fair And Tender Ladies -LRB- a very gentle lilting air which includes cello and harp.If you like Colonial-era music or even just easy-listening music that will relax you to the very depths of your soul this CD will not disappoint you ! It makes you feel like you 're attending a gala but genteel event at Mount Vernon or Montcello . One expects to see George Washington or Thomas Jefferson appearing around the corner any minute !
 A completely enchanting presentation of wonderful colonial tunes . The perfect mix of traditional hymns , revered folk songs and heart pounding reels . The highlight of the album is the hauntingly soothing rendition of `` Barbara Allen '' . You 'll feel like you have been transported back to a simpler time of warmth and spirit with this grand collection .
 There are a few discs in my collection that I seldom listen . Not because they do n't appeal to me
 Schubert 's B-flat sonata is a long , moving , profound work of art . Glenn Gould , who disliked Schubert 's music owing to the `` repetitive structures , '' spoke of attending a Richter recital in Moscow during the 1950s and , having initially dreaded the thought of sitting through the B-flat sonata , found himself utterly transfixed . He said that Richter 's playing was so powerful in its immediacy that it came across almost as improvisation . Richter 's tempo in the first movement -LRB- molto moderato -RRB- is daringly slow , and he plays the entire repeat -LRB- which was seldom done in those days -RRB- . Yet the beauty of the music and the playing transcend time and make me recall Eliot 's line
 The mesmerizing approach given by the sublime maestro Sviatoslav Richter is unique in the story of the disc . I love this Sonata D. 960 . Somehow it represents a musical testament of this poet and beloved musician and to my mind one of the three greatest Piano Sonatas ever composed . The astonishing musical ideas contained go far beyond the XIX Century and have served as inspiration to composers so distant in spirit as Arnold Schoenberg and obviously Gustav Mahler.Richter in this particular recording makes of this first movement meticulously played and extremely slow tempo to a limit in which literally the time seemed to float . A dimension level that I never had felt with any other performer.Despite Richter loved to play romantic composers , he never played under this mood . Behind the delicacy of his playing there was a careful sense of the expression and the meaning of every phrase . The artist must be an invisible bridge between the score and the audience and he must vanish . These words come from Richter and talk by themselves . This statement reveals besides , the absence of total involvement with the romantic expression because somehow the pianist would undraw the spirit and intention of the work . The reading of this Sonata must be considered as a mythical journey ; the cosmic heights reached in the First and Second Movements reveal to Schubert in one of his highest peaks . This version is absolutely unbeatable . Richter recorded it again in Aldeborough in 1964 but the final result was never the same . Acquire this historical performance before it becomes a status and hard to find issue among the conosseurs . Sviatoslav Richter
 I would like to purchase this cd , how do I get it ?
 I want to order another CD of A Sunday Homecoming and can not find any in our local stores . How do I get one .
 The Music is very good . Not exactly the one I was looking for , however , very nice to listen to .
 i have heard some of these song and they were very simple and spiritual i love them all
 The CD starts out with just words , then it works into phrases by the end of the disk . The format is the following
 I bought this CD so that I could brush up on my -LRB- limited -RRB- Spanish skills before a trip to Latin America . I listened to the CD while driving in my car , typically on my commute to work.This CD was just what I needed and does a good job of getting through the basic Spanish vocabulary . It is on the `` travelers '' level ... do n't expect to become a fluent translator based on this CD ... but that is not what the CD is about .
 This CD travels with me from car to home to work . I enjoy the format and timing . I hope they followup with a quiz CD that says the word in spanish and allows you responce time , then immediately says the same spanish word and the english word and it is catagorized like this CD is .
 Being from America , a country whose music scene is dominated largely by rap and popstars/boy bands , MoS 's Hard Energy is a fresh sound for these jaded ears . -LRB- Just to give you an idea of our stunted musical development , we 're lucky if the DJ throws on Darude 's `` Sandstorm '' or an ATB song in between Jennifer Lopez and some rap tune . In fact , `` Sandstorm '' has only recently started to get regular spins & become popular over here . -RRB- I recently took a whirlwind spring break through the pubs and clubs of London and was totally captivated by the pulsing , thumping , scintillating music that pervades the nightlife . After having heard hard house during my London romp , I just had to buy this compilation . I was not disappointed ; in fact , this CD never fails to get me energized and moving . I certainly am no expert on the genre but I find Fergie and Yomanda 's selections and mixing to be an extraordinary example of the fusion of house , trance , and other forms of ` hard ' club music . As we move into the new millennium , these two discs provide a synthesis of genres that ultimately produces a fresh sound that can be played profitably through the speakers of clubs worldwide . I 'm not gon na totally dismiss the US club scene , b/c there are quite a few talented DJ 's over here , but they 're just a few of the enlightented . The club scene is defined not only by DJ 's but by the people bumpin ' and movin ' out on the floor . If they bounce in the clubs to the latest hard house tracks but sit home with their stereos packed with nothing but latest throwaway pop , you can count on them being behind the times when it comes to club culture . On the whole , if US clubs are to compete with the cutting edge clubs of Europe , clubbers better plug into the UK 's sound and listen to tracks such as the ones on these discs ; they might learn a few things by doing so . Parting words
 This is a very good CD set . I bought it as my very first Techno CD and was a little skeptical , but it blew me away . Go get it . Check out Clubber 's Guide to Trance by ATB and Clubber 's Guide to Ibiza Summer 2000 by Judge Jules . I own those other two CDs and they are very good as well .
 I purchased this CD a while back , and I must say that it was a ground breaker for me . Before this CD is was mostly into Trance , but after hearing this im now into House . After I heard the first disk -LRB- mixed by fergie -RRB- i ordered the MoS annual 2000 . Then after hearing the second disk -LRB- mixed by yomanda -RRB- is ordered the Mos Auunal 2001 -LRB- spring edition -RRB- . This is a great CD , and a must buy if you love to go out and party all night long . But if thats not what you are looking for , check out The Chillout Session -LRB- another MoS release -RRB-
 Although the headline suggests otherwise , I 've got nothing bad to say about this MoS release , except that it is n't as hard as you may think . The tracks on the Fergie side seem to dip in and out of Trance a little too much to be classed as `` hard house '' . Fergie is actually quoted in the sleeve saying that he `` does n't play hard house , just hard music '' , which is fine , but you do n't get to read this before buying the album . Apart from that , the harder side of things shines through brilliantly , and nearly all the tracks are worth a mention , with highlights being JFK 's Good God , and Deception by Fergie himself . Best track has got to go to the 12 '' Thumpers Remix of Andy Farley 's Out of Control , which has just that little bit more edge than the original and is the hardlight of the album.Paul `` Yomanda '' Masterson really works well alongside Fergie . With a litlle bit more funk , and as messy as you can expect from the man , it plays from track to track leaving a smile on your face . The two standout tracks have to be Mauro Picotto 's Baguette , and Rene Campo 's Sleep . Picotto has the best drum sounds I 've heard all year , and Sleep reminds you of Kernkraft 400 's Zombie Nation . Give it another listen and you 'll realise it 's far superior.A fair summary would be that this album is brilliant . The mixing is flawless and the track selection is second to none . But if you 're looking for Hard House you 're much better off sticking to the `` Nukleuz Presents ... '' series , Hard House Anthems 2 or 3 being your best bet . That said , Hard Energy is more than worth the asking price .
 Sviatoslav Richter according to Emil Gilels was the policeman of the pianists . His fecund versatility and wide domain of the tonal specter allowed him to draw a very original Mozart , without excessive ornamentations . His Mozart sounds intimate , introspective and restrained ; he polishes the operatic accents and gives us a crystalline approach . His use of the pedal is discrete , virile building an invisible between Haydn and Beethoven . Richter 's performs Mozart as Walter did it , with special emphasis on the clarity and sunlight radiant . Walter came from a long journey conducting Mahler and Richter came from the oppressive atmosphere of his birthplace ; I mean both are concentrated to find the landscape after the battle
 New Idea Society features Stephen Brodsky from Cave In and Mike Law from Eulcid . Both bands are amazingly creative and this release from the pair is also amazing . the songs are good old acoustic songs that are catchy and non-repetitive . the entire album is very fresh sounding because of the fact that Law and Brodsky took their time -LRB- about two years -RRB- writing and recording the songs and making sure that each song is distinctly different and rocking . `` Will/Won ` t '' features piano as the main instrument and `` The Quiet Nora Lee '' has some sweet synth and keyboard work . one of the tracks even has Converge 's Kurt Ballou behind the drums . it does not get any better than this.overall , this album is just really damn good songwriting and musicianship . this album should be in your cd player right now !
 This is a fantastic CD , and it shows how BHTM have grown in their songwriting . From blistering rock -LRB- Dirty Juice , Love Transmission -RRB- , soul -LRB- ICU in Everything , Conquistadors -RRB- , and pop -LRB- Imaginary Ships , Angela Dangerlove -RRB- , this CD is one that will never grow old . BHTM is probably one of the most underappreciated bands around . If you 're a blues rock lover , this CD will NOT disappoint . Buy this and all of their other CDs .
 It 's really 4.5 stars , but I ca n't fractionalize.As a diehard fan of BHTM , it 's hard to say which album is my favorite , but Crimes of Passion is certainly one of them.Compared to `` Midnight Radio '' it 's the far end of the spectrum , whereas MR is indy and raw , Crimes is poised , polished and much more produced . Is one method way better than the other ? Depends on the listener . For this listener it does not . It is a much more mellow album than their previous Riviera , but Todd 's vocals are so much more clear that I understood every song without having to look up the lyrics in the liner notes.There has been some major advances here in Todd 's storytelling . The lyrics in `` Beauty Queen '' would make John Hiatt proud . `` Drought of 2013 '' paints a stark reality of a world turned to dust , and `` Peacemaker Blues '' with it 's Dylan-esqe feeling of `` why ca n't we all just get along is fabulous . '' `` Lost Child Astronaut '' is haunting and beautiful ; `` Imaginary Ships '' just makes you sway your head , especially once Todd starts wandering with the guitar . `` Angela Dangerlove '' is just a good rock ballad.But it 's not all mellow ... `` Dirty Juice '' rocks , `` Conquistadors '' is killer , especially when cranked . `` Love Transmission '' still has that edgy , raw sound that earlier fans love , and `` Come On -LRB- a more refined version from Riviera -RRB- is a good tune , however I appreciate it more when played live . See their new `` Live at the Fillmore DVD . '' You 'll see what I mean .
 Quite simply , I 'm glad that Big Head Todd and the Monsters are still doin ' it ! I 've had ` Crimes of Passion ' since first released , and it remains a constant play selection for me . Any BHTM fan that does n't quite ` get ' this CD needs to keep listening -LRB- while giving thanks that Todd and the gang have found a way to keep their fans in grace -RRB- . ` Imaginary Ships ' is one of their best ever . ... LOVE this CD and ca n't wait for the next one !
 Crimes of Passion is awesome . I 've been a BHTM fan since the early days in Boulder . The band has evolved to be sure , but Crimes of Passion is great effort . Honestly , it took me a listen or two before I really got into it , but there a few tracks on Crimes of Passion , especially Beauty Queen , that really have me hooked . I agree with the comments that this band is way underappreciated - if you have n't seen Todd play live you 're missing a chance to see one of the greatest guitar players ever . Though , I have to admit I do like the fact that I can see them this Feb in a nice cozy place that only holds 500 or so !
 I guess I ca n't say I 'm a die hard fan because I do n't love everything he does but I usually wind up getting it . I bought the cd at full price in a store which I never do anymore . Long story short , it 's a very nice album that I think I will play on mellow and rainy days . I seem to love it on rainy driving days right now . It 's not midnight raido or sister sweetly which are my favs . I go for the faster stuff and the long jams . But this has charm and for fans of blues and people that dig the slow stuff on stratagem then I 'd reccomend it . It 's towards the mellower vibey side but it 's solid . Conquistidors rubs me the wrong way but I actually dig dirty juice which some other people on here have dismissed .
 ... but I do like this album a whole lot . It 's kind of slow-groovy and soulful in parts and I found myself playing imaginary crimes till the end over and over and over . Took a drive through Massachusets to Williamstown and was heading west out to the thruway to go back to ny . It started to snow , hard but soft , lost child astronaut came on and it was magical , almost dreamlike while passing through the farm country which was quickley blanketed in white . I do n't know , I have a feeling that I 'll always remember that road trip when I play this album . I guess the best way I can tell a fan whether they 'll like this album is to know what you like from the band and if it 's not some slow sister sweetly types or slow stratagem stay away . The faster songs like conquistidors and dirty juice could be taken as bad blues songs . Stratagem , and Beautiful Mind both rubbed me the wrong way my first time , this did not . I 'd love to hear some long jams or some new rock twists from the band but as long as they come back and do some soulful stuff like this I 'll be happy .
 I 've been a BHT fan for some time . `` Crimes Of Passion '' is a definite change for the band . I like the shift in the style . `` Dirty Juice '' is interesting enough , but the song cycle really begins with `` Beauty Queen '' . Nice guitar work throughout . `` ICU in Everything '' is one of the wildest things I 've heard in awhile . Pick this cd up , you wo n't be sorry . I 've had it in the player for a week now .
 Robert Plant used to bemoan the fact that , when Led Zeppelin began touring in support of Led Zeppelin IV and they would play Stairway to Heaven , lots of people in the audience would be screaming for Whole Lotta Love . While none of the tunes on CoP will likely ascend to Stairway to Heaven 's lofty status , it IS a solid album with an easily-discerned feel all its own , which definitely strays from the what BHT has offered up in the past . This album is quiet , introspective and offers up , in place of crunchy Kensington Line-esque riffs , very tight but loose playing and very earthy , `` near '' lyrics ... if BHT 's last few albums are party discs , this is post-party , next-morning hangover fodder . This can be a blessing and a curse ; sometimes you want to blast off and sometimes you want to reflect and look within -LRB- or at least not exacerbate a migraine -RRB- . It 's a bit more restrained than , say , Broken Hearted Savior and Sister Sweetly , but it 's got a right-beneath-the-surface smoke point that , for better or worse , never comes out and plays . A fine album which will surely grow on the listener ; not the rule but rather the exception thereto .
 You can not expect a good band to pump out the same music like a factory from first album to last . Creative musicians explore , evolve , and fine-tune their craft over time . ` Crimes of Passion ' is an exploration ... and evolution . However , it is an album clearly rooted in the music that Big Head Todd and the Monsters are known for.Yes , they have played with some keyboard and , dare I say , loops on this album . However , it has been tastefully done . There is a little more ` soul ' added to this album -LRB- ` Angela Dangerlove ' , ` ICU in Everything ' -RRB- . They include some down and dirty blues-rock tunes such as ` Dirty Juice ' , ` Conquistador ' , ` Come On ' -LRB- bonus track from ` Riviera ' -RRB- , and ` Love Transmission ' . Todd Park Mohr 's vocals are more prevalent on this album as well as his story-telling lyrics in softer songs such as ` Drought of 2013 ' , ` Beauty Queen ' , and ` Peacemaker 's Blues ' -LRB- which could n't sound any more like Dylan ! -RRB- . Last but not least , the spacey groove of ` Imaginary Ships ' - bound to be one of the most popular tracks on the album -LRB- if not their catalog -RRB- . Will this album rock you like Riviera ? ... maybe not always . Is it still essential Big Head Todd ? ... you bet it is . Just give it a fair chance and I think it will impress you . And if you happen to catch the live performances of these tracks , you wo n't doubt it ever again !
 Self proclaimed BHTM aficionado here . This is a very , very solid collection . Heavy on blues , but more importantly heavy on Todd 's voice . If his vocals do n't make you a believer here , well , you lack appreciation for the finer things . Is it just me or does this guy 's voice age like a very fine wine ? Not to mention his telecaster is in full effect once again on the blues tracks , evoking Stevie Ray in many ways . To summarize the types of tracks , there are 4 heavy blues tracks , with Love Transmission an obvious rocking standout . The remaining 6 vary from ballad to poppy college rock . Angela Dangerlove is soulful and pleading with Todd 's lyrics , and has the quintessential lyrical craftsmanship we know BHTM for . ICU in Everything is a catchy experiment in poppy R&B remniscent of Prince , with outstanding percussion work by Brian Nevins . Imaginary Ships is unreal , albeit faux mainstream . Dripping with atmosphere is the rolling guitar in the background , and a canvas brushed heavily by raspy Todd vocals . It is both weary and hopeful . A must have for any Todd fan , or any person who respects what can happen when one of the greatest singers/songwriters/guitar players gets to make the music he wants to . It is both intelligent and steeped in the fluent style changes that are the hallmark of BHTM .
 Underappreciated group ; this CD is interesting from start to finish with several stand-out tracks . Very soulful sounds with clever lyrics . Highly recommended .
 This is definately a departure for the boys but I think it is refreshing . You ca n't blame a band for not putting out the same sounding stuff over and over . It may not be a jammin ' rock album but it is a solid effort . I never thought I would like the slower BHTM offerings on a release over the rockin ' ones , but that is the case here .
 Must say i liked this album from the get go!Dirty juice , beauty queen , conquistadors , and angela dangerlove , are all great bhtm tracks.drought of 2013 is a gem , along with love transmission and imaginary ships!its hard to pick a best track out of those 7 . peacemakerblues is a fine track , and loat child astronaut seems to be a reworked track from strategem , but not sure which ne.come on , is a throw away track that was added as a bonus to the first pressing of `` Riviera '' , as a hidden track.why they used it on this cd , who knows?average at best!the one clunker is , `` icu in everything '' , their worst track ever , in my opinion to over the top commercial , soul pop!but that 's minor compered to the great tracks.this cd reminds me of sister sweetly , with a touch of srategem .4 and a half stars really , but fine none the less !
 I knida heard about this group and when I got the dualdisk for a low price I thought why not ?? WOW !! imreally looking forward to exploring more of thier disks . This one is pretty close to perfect .
 For those of you who are lifelong BHT fans , the songs on this CD should make you finally aware just how much of a lyricist and composer Todd Park Mohr is . Listen to these songs twice before you judge and the second time follow the lyrics . You 'll be impressed how soulful and expressive he can be . Anyone who can not be transported to another place with `` Imaginary Ships '' and especially `` ICU in Everything '' is missing so much . Relationships are the events of life which cause us all pain and pleasure at some point and these songs speak to me of both .
 I have been a Big Head Todd fan for over 10 years . I recently watched their DVD `` Live at the Fillmore . '' It was the first time I heard their new music from `` Crimes of Passion . '' Musically and lyrically , this CD is hands down my favorite . The great thing about this band is that they remain true to their blues roots like in `` Angela Dangerlove '' and provide some incredible rock for the rock lover in me like in `` Come On . '' Big Head Todd and the Monsters continue to mature musically and I wait anxiously for their new project .
 Long time BHTM fans and new followers alike should enjoy this CD . It get 's started with `` Dirty Juice '' which is a rockin ' toe tapper that segues nicely into the slow & tasty `` Beauty Queen '' for a little of the classic Big Head Todd sound . `` Conquistador '' sounds like Dire Straits meets Hendrix , again with the un-mistakable BHT guitar and vocals and follows the uptempo to slow and dreamy pattern to the whole CD . A little hard and a little soft works to perfection as `` Come On '' a relatively short rockin ' tune at 2:48 that ends cold , has you wishing for just a bit more . A couple of tunes later the CD shifts into high gear with `` Love Transmission '' , into some nice guitar work on `` Imaginary Ships '' and then on to possibly one of the best cuts on the CD `` ICU in Everything '' which has an awesome sax break that again fits to perfection . Crimes of Passion is arrestingly awesome , and if you 've been a fan for a long time or just recently discovered the talents of Big Head Todd this CD needs to be in your collection !!
 This disc is edgey & soulful . Really captures what the band is all about .
 Holy Sh ** Batman , Todd Rocks ... This is , by far , Todd 's best release . A tribute to his influences . Hendrix , Led Zep , John Lee Hooker , Bob Dylan ... MOTOWN >> >> >> > Yeah , they 're all here . This disc is soulful , it ROCKS , blues deluxe . Yeah the MONSTERS bring it all to the table of this one . The only thing missing is Hazel Miller 's Big Mama sensual backing vocals . ICU in Everything took me back to my youth , listening to Teddy Pendergrass with my girl . Ouch ... Todd alternates rockin ' tunes with slower soulful takes that nod to the past.Of all the BHTM disc 's , this is the ONE .
 I first heard Pat Humphries at Take Back the Night in Albany New York . I saw her two more times before I left the East Coast , and fortunately bought the tape for Same Rain . My sadness about moving West was that I did not get to see Pat in Concert anymore and I overplayed my Same Rain tape . I am so happy to see this in CD.Pat has a beautiful voice and wonderful lyrics . I ca n't tell you how many people I have played the title track for . It is an anthem for Peace and understanding . When I felt angry with someone , I would play this song and it made me remember tolerance and love.I am going to buy this CD , to replace my well-played tape , and play it for my baby boy .
 As mentioned somewhere on this page , Pat also has a newer album with Sandy O. -LRB- Emma 's Revolution -RRB- called One x One Million = Change -LRB- listed on Amazon as One -RRB- . They do play all around the country , so you can hear them or even host them at a house concert . Check out www.emmasrevolution.com for more information . -LRB- N.B. I designed the CD packaging for One and love their music -RRB- .
 I purchased this wonderful album for a friend who loves Viennese waltzes . It was the last copy that Amazon had . The jacket was slightly soiled , but I kept the album anyway because I could n't find it sold at any other store.The music is lush and will wrap you in its arms and take you dancing with it . If you listen to the music samples , you 'll get a good idea of what the album sounds like . My friend loves her CD , and I 'm so glad I found it . If you buy this CD , I know you 'll enjoy it
 Before I begin writing this review I would like to pose a question to the folks at DG/Universal . Among the great French classical musicians of the 20th Century , is Monique Haas more fondly remembered in the United States than Pierre Fournier ? Clearly the answer must be yes , because you have decided to reissue your new Monique Haas Original Masters box set domestically while this recent Pierre Fournier is only available as a pricey import . UNI , you once again leave me scratching my head at your marketing decisions , but then I never was very good at judging popularity contests.Ultimately , the music is all that matters , and there are some fine examples on this 6CD set , `` Pierre Fournier
 Pierre Fournier belongs to a small handful of truly great string players of the 20th century . His beautiful sound , impeccable taste and musicianship , and perhaps most importantly , his deep respect for the music , places him in a unique position among solo cellists . These recordings from Deusche Gramaphon capture him at his zenith . The Dvorak Concerto with Szell and the Berlin Philharmonic is certainly my `` desert island '' cello recording . This is a collection every music lover should have .
 Can you be precise and emotional ? Can you make the solo instrument that part of the orchestra family that from time to time pierces the horizon only to be reunited into a new adventure ? Can you be smart and playful ? Can you -LSB- ... ? -RSB- Can you pull me out of what I 'm doing to write this review considering that I spend about 20-30 hours with music in a week?If the answer is yes , you must know what I 'm talking about , for you 've been introduced to that class of musician defined by rigor and distinction.If the answer is no , that can only mean you have not given yourself a chance to experience the musical paradise . Do n't take any more time , let 's meet there and have Fournier guide us . Then you 'll agree , it 's just so !
 This album is really fantastic.Alexandra has tender voice , that conduced secure the melodies created by Roland Wurzer , a great musician.the others do not stay behind , specially the drummer Moritz .
 I really liked this CD . Its run-time was just over 30 minutes but it had 5 new tracks from one of the best new Goth-Metal bands out there . The live performances of the Salvation and Realm of Darkness were excellent . The Bonus Multimedia Tracks can be accessed through a computer 's CD-Rom drive . They are videos of the Salvation and Realm of Darkness . Suspira was a Goth-Metal CD with heavy guitars and a singer with classical voice training . Conflict of Interest continues the tradition .
 I already loved `` Suspiria '' , but this one is killer !!! BUYBUYBUYBUY , best goth metal ever heard !
 This is a very funny CD from start to finish . The Lovemaster bit makes me roll on the floor every time I hear it , but the rest of it is equally funny . Get this CD and enjoy a great comedian !
 I too almost ran off the road while listening to `` The Love Master '' ! In fact , just sitting down may not be safe enough -- I could n't even BREATHE for a minute . Keep the oxygen handy .
 Craig is absolutely hillarious . This is a must item for all to have especially at your next get together with friends . Guarranteed to put a smile on everyone 's faces .
 Craig Shoemaker is comedy genius . He is so multi-talented ! We never miss him when he comes to Texas and listen to his CD often . The first time I saw him in person at a comedy club , my face hurt for days from laughing so hard . We just love Barney , Andy , Granny , the `` Woo People '' , Craig himself -LRB- is he really there ??? -RRB- , and of course , `` The Lovemaster . ''
 Unless your sense of humor is a 0 on the 10 scale , you 'll laugh out loud at Craig 's humor and impressions .
 His suave `` Lovemaster '' character will have both women and men howling in tears . I brought this CD with me on a weekend trip , and everyone new that came through the door was greeted with , `` Hey , you got ta hear this !! Play the Lovemaster for him !! '' Also , Craig 's take on the goings-on in Mayberry is something that must be heard !!
 CAUTION ... do not attempt to drive while listening to this show ... this CD should be on some sort of danger list !!! It will cause erratic driving brought on by laughing so hard ... I had never heard the Love Master before and almost ran into a ditch while listening to it for the first time . . and that 's a true story ! F'en A this guy is FUNNY
 Criag Shoemaker has the abilty to use his voice unlike any other comdeian around . No matter what he says , or who he is at the time he says it -LRB- aka `` The Lovemaster '' or Barney Fife '' you can be sure he will make you laugh .
 SHOEMAKER IS A COMIC GENIUS . HIS USE OF VOICES AND CHARACTERS IS UNMATCHED TODAY . WHAT A CD.CRAIG
 This is one of the best comedy cds that I have ever heard . You will laugh like crazy at Craig 's other personality .
 Colonial Traditions is a the finest album of Colonial-era tunes that I have heard in the last 10 years . The production qualities of the musical pieces and talents of the musicians will absolutely blow you away ! The beautifully blended insturmentation ranges from fiddle , cello , string bass , mandolin , hammered dulcimer , classical and steel-string guitar , accordian , recorder , flute , wood flute , Celtic harp , cintern , bodhran , bones , and triangle.The selection of tunes includes the well known Rose Tree/Over The Water Fall Medley , Barabara Allen , The Girl I Left Behind , St. Ann 's Reel , Fisher 's Hornpipe , and Gary Owen -LRB- Theme of Custer 's 7th Cavalry -RRB- . Lesser known but equally marvelous tracks on the album are the Blarney Pilgrim -LRB- a catchy tune featuring a fine accordian -RRB- , The Water Is Wide -LRB- a hauntingly beautiful arrangement blending fiddle , flute , hammered dulcimer , and guitar -RRB- , Going to Boston/On the Road to Boston Medley -LRB- a snappy feel-good melody carried by fiddle and hammered dulcimer -RRB- , I 'll Give My Love An Apple , I 'll Mend Your Pots and Kettles -LRB- an easy-going but peppy piece featuring fiddle , hammered dulcimer , and recorder -RRB- , and Come All Ye Fair And Tender Ladies -LRB- a very gentle lilting air which includes cello and harp.If you like Colonial-era music or even just easy-listening music that will relax you to the very depths of your soul this CD will not disappoint you ! It makes you feel like you 're attending a gala but genteel event at Mount Vernon or Montcello . One expects to see George Washington or Thomas Jefferson appearing around the corner any minute !
 A completely enchanting presentation of wonderful colonial tunes . The perfect mix of traditional hymns , revered folk songs and heart pounding reels . The highlight of the album is the hauntingly soothing rendition of `` Barbara Allen '' . You 'll feel like you have been transported back to a simpler time of warmth and spirit with this grand collection .
 SINGS FOLK SONGS and FOLK SONG WORLD were released on Roulette label in 1959 & 1960 . They 've been out of print for many years , and although neither contain top 40 hits , they demonstrate Jimmie Rodgers doing what he does best -- tell stories for folks of all ages with clarity , intelligence and imagination . Not to mention the first rate vocals . My favorite tune on SINGS is `` Lord Randal , '' the story of a young man poisoned by a wicked fiance . `` The Crocodile , '' `` Waltzing Matilda , '' `` The Fox & Goose '' and `` Froggy '' are great tunes for children ; some of these also were sung by Burl Ives . WORLD continues in a similar path . Perhaps its best known tune is `` English Country Garden , '' which adds some challenging lyrics to a number familiar to all beginning piano students . `` Whiticombe Fair '' is a humorous song about an overworked horse . Thankfully , someone has discoveredthese long lost treasures and reissued them . ... . Keep up the good work so the next generation can discover this essential music .
 This Album is a treasure and should be in everyone 's music library . Jimmie is the best folk singer ever !!!
 This is a great album by a great band . While it shares a great deal of oi and rock 'n' roll influence with their previous work , this album definately shows how the deal had changed since Who 's Pulling your Strings ? . First of all , the production on this album is much more fleshed-out and full-sounding , making for a more in-your-face experience . The sound nmow also incorporates much more old school hardcore than their earlier albums . It has a good mix of oi-ish songs , such as Richard Bachman , and Hang 'em High . Some of the more hardcore songs include Cool Hand Luke and The Great Deception . C. Lo and Fool 's Errand have a great sound mixing straight-up punk with rock 'n' roll lead guitar . The only downfall i really think this album has lies in the song Vultures , which overall , is a great song . However , it ends with a slowly-fading , metally breakdown , which i have to say is just terrible . On a more positive note , the album ends very strongly , with a pumped-up version of Rise Up , from their first Facedown release . This sets a high standard for later work . It never gets old . Good job . Bye it . -LSB- other stuff you say at the end of a good review -RSB-
 The Deal 's third relese on Facedown Records , blends the elements of old school hardcore with streetpunk and Oi ! Just think `` Agnostic Front meets The Anti-Hereos '' and what you get is The Deal . This albulm is filled with great Singalongs , fast punk , tough hardcore , and alot of rock n roll . So if you like Punk , Oi ! or hardcore this albulm is for you .
 Fast easy transaction , item was in condition as advertised . Seller was very knowledgeable about history of CD and group .
 All I remember of Ministry of Sound is some sucky 80 's music.A dutch friend of mine told me to get this compilation , and according to him good taste in music is `` his only skill . '' He has pointed out other albums before and never failed me , so I gave it a shot.Wow . I mean , really , wow . This is a GREAT compilation . It is SO listenable . I can listen to it for hours . It 's got some upbeat tracks , some slower ambient tracks , some dancey tracks , and all the artists I like -LRB- Lemon Jelly , Groove Armada , Leftfield ... -RRB- in a very seamlessly melded chilled out * double * CD.It 's a must have for any collection . It really is . A bargain at any price .
 Well this really does n't need a review , as the briefest of glances at the track selection reveals all . Much like the radio-play friendly NOW compilations in stores , the Ministry of Sound deliver their scheduled package of cuts for club kids . 36 bona fide radio-length hits , not really flowing in a logical order , nor necessarily mixed well ... but the best value in tunes to be had . Only this time , the focus lies on `` chillout '' tracks suitable for comedown after a hard night 's adventures.The hottest chart toppers are pushed first , hence the sublime American Beauty score-sampling Jakatta ` American Dream ' and , er , Fatboy Slim ` Demons ' . Alright , ignore that one . Then a decent chunk of quality music gets spruced up one last time -LRB- ` King of My Castle , ' ` The Child ' -RRB- before hopeful retirement , with , yes , Nightmares on Wax 's seminal ` Les Nuits ' landing on it 's 1296th compilation to date.So consider this more a superb sampler of all the acts frequently name dropped and chart referenced that you 've possibly never heard . Tim ` love ' Lee , Bonobo , Lemon Jelly and Sumsonic Presents -LRB- the surprise find in the lot -RRB- offer strong examples of underground leftfield artists restoring buzz to the sunset scene . You 'll surely skip tracks , but likely discover new favorite bands in the process . I 'll say this , The Ministry of Sound follows a winning formula , offering so much at too low a price to ignore . 3.5 stars
 great smattering of tastes . Disc 1 is downtempo groove music , Disc 2 is chilled-out house music . Both are great in their own distinctive ways . All tracks are worth listening to , with quite a few classic trancehouse tunes thrown in .
 It 's Sunday morning following a long night at the club . Physically and emotionally , you 're a mess . You 're probably suffering from a major hangover , or your ears are still ringing from hours of the relentless beats of house music . You have no intention of getting out of that bed anytime soon , and you 're looking for a CD that 'll get you ready to take on a brand new day . The brains behind Ministry of Sound have created a solution , and it 's called the Chillout Session . This two disc set has one CD of mid-tempo numbers ranging from alternative pop to electronica , while the other CD has a collection of slightly housed-up jams , and a few ambient numbers . The selection is well put together and sets the tone with the beautiful `` The Shining '' from Badly Drawn Boy . This track has appeared in quite a few chillout compilations , and it 's easy to see why
 This is a for runner of all the ... chill albums an exellent mix of sounds , a true classic compilation .
 Ministry of Sound is a massive label that specializes in all types of party music , whether it be soul , Ayia Napa , disco , house , trance , discotheque and of course chillout , which was what they pushed and pushed and pushed so much that they saturated the market with redundant products in 2001 . When I got this , I remember the exact day and place and what was on the `` features '' wall . This one , Chillout Session 2 , Dreamstates and several others were screaming for attention and loaded with `` 2 for 22 pounds '' stickers . Sadly , most of them were extremely similar and maybe not worth the 13 pounds -LRB- about 19 dollars at the time -RRB- individually . But I was suckered and figured I 'd give them a shot so picked up two I thought would be different - this one and the sequel , released that summer.This is a good mix of some easy going pop/chill tunes on cd 1 , and a bit more upbeat with some of the more popular club tracks at the time . But never are the songs over-bearing , there 's a consistent vibe . The feel of this cd is not to make you lethargic but to keep you content , in my opinion . But you do have some very popular songs here - lemon jelly , kinobe , rob d , sneaker pimps , Thievery Corp , bonobo , moby , nightmares on wax ... if you like chillout chances are you 've already heard and seen these exact songs and artists ten fold on other compilations . The second cd features the likes of jakatta , york , sasha , underworld , alex gopher , bent , energy 52 . Again , all well known and perhaps overplayed artists but not necessarily of the ` chillout ' nature . CD 2 is very interesting in that it goes from a light club feel to more ambient sounding tunes and heavier beats.The verdict ? This is a solid compilation of tunes that in the winter/spring of 2001 represented what was sort of new at the time . I felt that CD 1 was a bit better and more original - I dug the remake to the old Stone Roses track and have always been a huge Kinobe fan . But today this compilation might be out-dated and the cuts over-played . And be forewarned that Ministry of Sound loves to mix everything , therefor none of the tracks are really stand-alone . If you want to check out a few other chillout comps from the time -LRB- 2001 -RRB- then take a look at Serve Chilled III , Renaissance Ibiza , Dreamstates , Brazilectro III and heck , maybe some other Ministry Stuff . Just be VERY careful of overlap as it will be virtually impossible to find two cd 's without at least 2 of the same tracks on them .
 Picked this up on a whim a few years back , and it remains among the best CDs I 've ever bought . The flow of the album , and a number of surprisingly luscious tracks -LRB- chicane , lemon jelly , badly drawn boy , etc. -RRB- make it perfect for an evening , a sunday morning , or a train ride any day .
 All I can say is WOW ! This double disc set has everything to bring your evening to a peaceful and relaxing wind down . It has all the elements to let you kick back , relax , and Chillout . A must for all Ministry Of Sound fans !
 EXCELLENT DOUBLE CD . DIFFERENT STYLE OF MUSIC . REAL MELLOW WITH VERY GOOD ORIGINAL BEATS . HAS THAT EUROPEAN STYLE . I HAD IT BEFORE , BUT IT GOT STOLEN . TOOK A LITTLE WHILE TO HUNT IT DOWN . BUT IT WAS WORTH IT .
 this ministry of sound session was the first in a series of groundbreaking albums that set the standard for modern downtempo/chillout compilations . this very session was the one that gave me a real musical definition of chillout . a first-time listener will immediately appreciate tracks like chicane 's no ordinary morning , badly drawn boy 's shining , moby 's natural blues , and the tracks by beloved -LRB- sun shining -RRB- and sneaker pimps -LRB- 6 underground -RRB- . then , the tracks by groove armada -LRB- one of my all-time favorites -RRB- , york , jakatta , bedrock , william orbit and leftfield will take you to another level and will get you into a laidback and chilled mood . and then , there is les nuits by nightmares on wax
 This album is hot , enough said . If you own any Ministry of sound cd 's you can understand the quality . This cd is another example of a finely produced album . A definate add on to any techno connoisseur .
 This is my favorite album of 2006 . I like it Better than this year 's Agalloch , Isis , Tool , Katatonia , Summoning , Green Carnation , etc. . But even while it beats out all those , I still do n't think it surpasses my longtime favorite from Novembre themselves , `` Novembrine Waltz . `` But enough playing favorites , time to explain the music . There was no doubt in my mind that Novembre would create another stunning masterpiece , adding to the previous three , even while being fairly different from their previous releases.The most distinct change is perhaps there are very little growling vocals here . I have always liked Carmello Orlando 's growling vocals , but Novembre has always seemed like a band that would eventually stray away from that . Maybe they will return a little more with the next album , I do n't know . But I do know that even though the growling vocals were good , I can always go listen to the old albums . His clean vocals are so good that they really need to be used more , and they can be very diverse in themselves . There are many self-harmonizations with overdub , and everything from soft , heartfelt lulling , like in the middle portion of `` Memoria Stoica '' and in `` Geppetto , '' to incredibly powerful , emotional singing , such as the chorus in `` Comedia , '' the beginning of `` Aquamarine , '' and in `` The Promise . '' Also , there are many more lyrics in Italian than ever before . I really love when the lyrics are in Italian , bands should sing in their native tongue more often , it seems more authentic.Not only have growling vocals somewhat vanished , but the album as a whole is n't quite as heavy as previous releases . There are many acoustic-driven parts , especially many intros to songs such as `` Reason , '' `` Jules , '' `` Geppetto , '' and many melodies reminiscent of vast Italian countrysides.The amazing melodies of the band still live on , of course , like the mini-solo in `` Aquamarine , '' the sudden , intimidating riff in `` Geppetto , '' the melodic , unforgettable solo in `` Comedia '' and also the heart-pounding intro to it , the acoustic-atop-electric Melodies in `` Reason , '' among countless others.The album 's cover song is `` The Promise , '' originally by Duran Duran . Unfortunately I have never heard the original . All I know is , unlike Novembrine Waltz 's cover song `` Cloudbusting , '' which many people could n't stand , this song fits perfectly with the flow of the rest of the album , despite having an electronic-like melody hidden in the background . Most likely , if you did n't know the original song like me , you would have never guessed it 's a cover song . This may even be my favorite song on the album , of course , I say that about almost every song here when it 's playing.The songwriting might not be quite as `` Progressive '' as say Novembrine Waltz , the songs do n't quite explore a thousand different ideas . I 'm not quite sure if that 's why I still like NW better . Maybe they 've improved their songwriting so it 's not so all-over-the-place , but , I never really thought NW was like that . The songs still go from heavy to soft parts sometimes very suddenly , but they seem to flow much better and keep the same overall theme more often.Again , Novembre has impressed me more than I would have ever thought , and this album has spawned several more countless classics for the band . They 're making quite a name for themselves as some of today 's finest musicians .
 For reasons I can not fully understand , Novembre has always been compared to Opeth and it 's been said that they were heavily influenced by them . While it is a given that there are certain similarities between the two bands , as both both acts recorded their debut in 1994 in Dan Swano 's Unisound Studio and both liked the idea of alternating between heavy , extreme sounds to slower , clean moments , Novembre 's new album Materia should settle any argument that they have always been a unique band in their own right and they have established themselves as a distinct group.Materia is in many ways the most realized Novembre work . Although it is n't as heavy as , say , Classica ; or as complex as Novembrine Waltz , it is excellently composed in the way that the tracks are constructed where every part of the song comes together and plays off each other . There are many contrasting elements in their songs that interact with each other in ways Opeth have never done before . Harmonically , this is one of the most intricate Novembre albums ever , combining their penchant for trance-inducing melancholia and progressive songwriting . Though this one is considerably less heavy than their previous releases , it still transpires a lot atmosphere as it carries a dense and relentlessly dark allure that evokes feelings similar to Katatonia 's The Great Cold Distance . Actually , I firmly believe that Materia and The Great Cold Distance are two of the best releases of the year so far and , in ways I fail to describe , complement each other beautifully . Maybe it 's the production , the introspective lyrical themes , the somewhat prevalant Tool references -LRB- mostly in the vocal department -RRB- , or simply the fact that both bands have surprised their fans greatly exceeding their expectations.On Materia , the mellow moments clearly outnumber the heavy ones , as Carmelo Orlando makes less use of his distinctive growls and black-ish screams . The music presents a more acoustic-driven approach with heavier guitar riffs contrasting them , and Carmelo emphasizes his diverse vocal skills , which sometimes evoke Tool due to the heavily processed vocal overdubs . Vocal-wise , this could be his most diverse work to date . He goes from melancholic low registers on `` Verne '' , featuring wonderful acoustic guitars , searing electric leads , and thick drum fills ; to downright melodious singing on `` Aquamarine '' which he finishes with snarly , vicious screams backed by killer harmonies . A similar approach is executed on `` Jules '' , beginning with incessant kick drums and electronia-tinged atmospherics , as Italian lyrics with gripping vocal harmonies are delivered . The second half of the piece is capped by intricate transitions and melodic guitar passages . The two songs that highlight Carmelo 's vocal skills best are `` Geppeto '' , whose Garden Wall circa Path of Dreams-like classical intro is simply breathtaking . The bass playing on this song , while subtle , is marked by some of the most atypical chord progressions you 'll hear , underlying Carmelo 's best vocal melody to date before he opts for spoken vocals , whispers , and humming . The part where he sings , `` Quel giorno il mare era un quadro di colori scuri , disse ` Guarda un po chi c ' &egrave; ! Mi sei mancato compare ! ' '' -LRB- which would translate like
 Novembre is not really a band that strikes many as familiar . On the contrary , even among a lot of the more in-depth listeners to progressive metal Novembre means no more then the 11th month of the year . All this while they have already published a number of 5 previous albums over a span of more then 10 years.Is this because their music plain-out sucks ? God no . In their last few albums they have brought forth different music sounds , which they blended together more then successfully to create their own style . It 's hard to describe them , but Novembre can probably be best compared to Opeth . They too use death growls and heavy passages in their songs , which at times can provide quite the rough experience . At the same time , Novembre merges this with a lot of soft -LRB- acoustic -RRB- parts in their music . Combined , this results in different powerful emotions being expressed . You will find slow moving ballads , heavy headbangin ' pieces and energetic riffs all fit together in their music.With Materia as their latest installment they have nailed it again . Surely this album is different from their previous , yet in my opinion with but positive outcomes as a result . It is true that you wo n't be finding as many death growls as in their previous releases , but the more clean and emotional vocals make up for more then that . Same goes for the guitar work , it may not be defined as the heaviest of their discography , but it 's certainly no less then their best . The album is really such a journey , giving away so many different feelings to it that it would be no justice describing it as mere `` Death Metal '' music.If you 're a -LRB- death -RRB- metal fan or can appreciate good music in general , do yourself a favor and get Materia now . This is truly a fantastic album by a way to underrated band .
 Novembre 's Materia is a wonderful mix of Dark Rock , Alternative , and Acoustic Rock . Songs like Memoria Stoica/Vetro , Croma and Nothijngrad are standouts , dawdling , encompassing songs that revolve around wonderful vocals , -LRB- mostly sung in Italian -RRB- . This is a strong , steady , album that does n't let you down as it progresses through the mature songs .
 This album -LRB- and Band itself -RRB- is what I call Beautiful metal music ! It is atmospheric , dark and lovely . The transitions among the songs are unbelievable and amaze me ! I 've never heard a band that can transition this way nor this good . Not to mention every song is beyond , for me . For Novembre , every album I think sounds completely different . And ALL are amazing . This album you can say , is abit `` softer '' -LRB- but still metal -RRB- .
 This album is simply stunning . Novembre has that ability to deliver a really distinctive mood with their albums and Materia is in my opinion their masterpiece -LRB- Novembrine Waltz is close though ... -RRB- . They have been often compared to Opeth but albums like this one really mark the difference between the two bands . Contours in Novembre 's music are always so `` foggy '' that their music seems to be coming out from a dream -LRB- listen to `` Reason '' or `` Acquamarine '' -RRB- , mood is often more important than mere technique . When it comes to communicate ethereal emotions and feeling I think that Novembre really shines -LRB- listen to `` Memoria Stoica/Vetro '' or `` Croma '' -RRB- and Materia is one of the brightest stars in Novembre 's firmament . If you like melodic/prog death -LRB- Opeth like bands -RRB- or bands with that kind of `` distinctive mood '' -LRB- I can think of Katatonia for example -RRB- you totally have to check Novembre out . But even if you are a fan of psychedelic rock you might find this album absolutely enjoyable.If you want to listen to their heaviest side probably `` Novembrine Waltz '' would be the album for you -LRB- almost no growls here ... -RRB- but if you 're looking for some really intense music to seat back and get lost Materia is what you may be looking for .5 StarsI want to add that this stuff does n't get old at all . Year after year there is gon na be that winter 's night you 'll feel like lay down in bed , turn off the lights and let the music run . Materia will be a really good fellow traveler .
 Have you ever been listening to a song on the radio thinking `` hmm , this is n't too bad , but you know , it would be better if the drummer suddenly let rip with a double kick drum frenzy '' ? Or perhaps you 've thought `` this song is OK , but it would be really cool if the guitarist really kicked his guitar into overdrive here '' ? Well , chances are , listening to the radio , neither of these things are ever going to happen , but listen to ` Materia ' by Novembre and that 's exactly what you 'll get.Italian outfit Novembre started as an off-centre Death Metal band , throwing in acoustic passages and clean vocals to create moods and atmospheres in an era where such things were gimmick rather than commonplace . Over five albums , the band 's sound has evolved to a point where it is not Death Metal by any stretch of the imagination , but more an amalgam of modern Rock , moody melodies and Metal highlighting . Imagine if bands like Tool or Audioslave or Nickelback actually knew what Metal was , and occasionally used Metal-sounding guitars , or had drummers who could genuinely kick out the jams . Thankfully too , the album title has nothing to do with a Final Fantasy video game obsession.The advantage of playing mostly Rock , while coming from a Metal background , means that Novembre still know how to let rip and carve up a song when they need to . Listening to the album , the first few tracks pass by , doing more than enough to keep the listener interested , but occasionally there seems to be something missing . That 's where the old Metal skills come in . The vocals are clean , clear and plaintive , which can become a little one-dimensional at times , and you wish the vocalist would just cough up a wad of phlegm and let rip with a gravelly Death Grunt , and suddenly , on the fourth track `` Aquamarine '' he does ! A bit further on through the album , you find yourself wondering `` hey , do ya reckon these guys can still play fast '' ? And then the introduction to `` Comedia '' blasts through the speakers , a high tempo , full on Death Metal blast.If you 're looking for an album of Cryptopsy-esque techno-Death , or slabs of straight forward Obituary-style Death Metal , you 're looking in the wrong place here . This is an album of subtleties , but without the all too common descent into Gothic idiocy . Often , the only clue to this not being above-average radio Rock is a too-heavy guitar , or drums being played too aggressively . Still , Novembre keep it reasonably simple , relying on little outside the guitar/drums/bass / vocal staple . `` Geppetto '' is sung in the band 's native Italian , something which many bands from non-English speaking backgrounds do n't do enough of . Perhaps a criticism which could be levelled at this album is the songs are too long at times , sometimes playing like a couple of different , unrelated tunes stuck together with a bridge.While not something likely to become an instant classic , or indeed anyone 's favourite album , ` Materia ' is an album to revisit when you ca n't face a dose of screaming bloody gore . Imagine Opeth without the boring bits , or a less Folk-oriented Amorphis . And forget all your hair-splitting genre labels , like Atmospheric Melodic Trad/Death Folk Metal , because you 'll just end up with a silly list of meaningless words which do n't come near describing the music .
 If I could I 'd have rated it higher than 5 stars ! 1 `` Opinions '' really gets the cd started and in the mood with a fast tune .2 . `` Yesterday '' makes you just wan na start dancing , it 's just a great song and good lyrics .3 . `` Cadillac '' is a really strong and `` hard '' song and I can listen to it over and over . The video is really funny too ! 4 . `` Another Day '' sounds a lot like a blink 182 song , but it 's definitely a good song .5 . `` Without You '' is a slower song , one of my personal faves and a song that you ca n't get enough of .6 . `` Fuct Up Kid '' is a funny song , catchy tune .7 . `` It 's Over '' also one of my personal favorites because the chorus ROCKS!great , great , great ... 8 . `` Reason '' ... VERY unique song not really like the others , slower i guess considered THE `` ballad '' on this cd , since most songs are upbeat . Has Monique Powell , good vocals ! 9 . `` Breakin Down '' more upbeat , good after hearing the slow song10 . `` Chelsea '' good song . . title probably came from a past expericence with a girl , kind of sad11 . `` Misunderstood '' head banging song ! 12 . `` Drawing Board '' sounds again like a blink 182 , but has to be DEFINITELY one of the best because it 's really sweet , not a slow song , but girls like me love it , just listen to the lyrics .13 . `` Mothers Prayer '' good tune , not really a head banging song , but still great14 . `` Living Dead '' best choice to end the cd with because it 's one more last upbeat song ... Ever since i saw MEST , GOOD CHARLOTTE , SUGARCULT , and LEFTY in concert I 've loved all those bands and their songs rock , and trust me it 's hard for me to be a fan of a band , they have to be REALLY GOOD . So anybody that just wants a good cd buy it , that 's all I can say .
 MEST 's 3rd album -LRB- yes , the third . No matter what someone tells you , their first debut album was Mo Moneyz Mo 40z -RRB- turns out to be maybe their worst , but still has its kicks . With the single `` Cadillac '' , a song about partying after Tony Lovato 's -LRB- lead vocals/guitar -RRB- girlfriend dumps him , it catches the listener 's ear . But if you 've heard any of the other MEST albums , you 'd agree on me with this one
 Mest is a great band and their music is something that people can relate too . Yea there songs are mainly about then whining about women problems but if you know them like I do the guys could care less about women its all about partying and their music . The guys live in my old town and I still hang out with them every so often , they are workin on another album so look foward to some more great tunes .
 Mest is an awesome band . I think they live up to what real punk is . Go buy their albums its way worth the money !
 I loved this Cd soooo much . I bought it , and the next week , i took it to my friends house , and played it , a while later , i took it out of her stereo , and placed it upsidedown on her desk . BIG mistake !!! we then proceeded to light candles a such , when she knew she was n't allowed to , then we had to smother the flmae , and the smoke went everywhere . then she sprayed perfume around the room , and it landed on my wonderful Destination unknown CD ! I WAS SO MAD ! She runined it , and I now have to go buy another one ! But yes . . as I was saying , awesome CD . Probably my favourite out of all of their Cd 's , and i think they 'll keep getting better !
 This CD is on my top 5 list , In fact . . Probably the 1st ! MEST has talent ! I hope to see them get big some day ! This band rocks ! Other bands that you 'd probably like is Blink 182 , Simple Plan , and Saves The Day .
 Some of you might know Mest from their hit single `` What 's The Dillio '' from their first album , Wasting Time . Well , they 're back with a new album and fortunately they overcame sophomore jinx by creating a amazing album . The CD starts with the fast pop-punk tune `` Opinions '' and from there the CD only gets better . Then the CD reaches their new single `` Cadillac '' . This song is great with it 's starting hip-hop beat and goes into a heavy punk riff and then goes to their classic pop-punk style and blends elements of hip-hop with it . Overall the CD is great with a serious song `` Mother 's Prayer '' which is also great , the whole CD is good and I highly recommend it , best CD of last year alongsides the new blink-182 CD .
 In there new album , Mest changes it up a beat with a different style in tracks such as cadillac and reasons . The rest is good old fashion punk . Quick drums and riffs and catchy lyrics . This is a must have album . If you like the cd , which you will , check them out live where they tear it up even more .
 if you like any punk or emo this is your record . Combining emo , punk , and a little bit of reggae to make a great CD . Mest will have you singing along to all of the songs and annoy you when you cant get them out of your head . If you dont have it , buy it .
 This is one of the best Cd 's I 've heard in a long time !! I usually get a Cd and there 's only one or two songs on the whole Cd I Like , but I like all the songs on this !! Plus I 've met the band before and they 're really cool and down to earth ! I love this band and you will too !!

 Mest 's new album Destination Unknown is the best new thing out . This CD has got a bumpin ' beat in Cadillac , a melancholy love lost in Chelsea and Rock all over the place . Great album , great band Buy this CD !!!
 When I bought this CD , I was just expecting a bunch of hot guys hopping around with their guitars singing about relationships . I was right . But there is more to this CD than that . The first song , `` Opinions '' is n't really about relationships . `` Cadillac '' is a fun song just about going out and having fun . Sure , Tony talks about his girlfriend a bit in there , but the song is still fun . The only thing that confuses me about that song is where the scratching comes from . This CD turned me into a fan for life . Once I heard this CD I told a bunch of friends about and urged them to buy a CD . Most of them did . I think if you like fun songs , fun pop punk bands , A New Found Glory , Good Charlotte , or blink-182 you will definately like this CD . Go buy it with Wasting Time ...
 The newest cd from Mest , Destination Unknown is very good . I think that the songs have a very creative punk style and good lyrics . The band writes about relationships , hanging out , and other issues . The CD contains songs such as Cadillac and It 's Over . I think that this is a cool cd to jam to with friends or just when chilling by yourself , you can get totally into it .
 Mest 's new album `` Destination Unknown '' is a great album which mixes catchy pop hooks with a punk edge . i highly recommend this album .
 Mest is one of the best bands out there today . Many people I am sure have heard their old song Dilio , and believe me , they have only gotten better . I seriously recommend getting this CD because all of their songs are awesome !! None of them are bad , or ones that you might want to skip over . I love this CD , and I always have it on in my car , it is great driving music !! People really ought to listen to this CD because their songs are really fast paced , and you ca n't help but sing to them . Another cool thing about this band is that they are from Chicago !! They have great use of the guitar , and I love the song It 's Over !! You should really listen to this CD , I ca n't stress this enough !!
 Mest 's Destination Unknown is , honestly , the greatest cd I 've ever listened to . If I had to live the rest of my life with only 1 cd , it would definetly be Mest . I listen to it every morning when I wake up , the best start to my day , and I listen to it every night when I go to bed , the best way to fall asleep . And then I listen to it a little in between . So , yeah , the cd kicks -LSB- rear -RSB- , and I recommend that you all get it.Buh bye , Lauren
 I just wanted to comment on the Destination Unknown album by Mest . I bought the album about a month ago and have n't been able to stop listening to it . I think people who have n't bought the cd do n't know what they are missing . This album totally rocks and the lyrics are awesome ! This is some great music . How could I not give it a five star rating ?
 I picked up the new cd DESTINATION UNKNOWEN , by the crazy guys in mest and i ould liek to say i was amazed . Thsalbum shows a more mature soun , yet ep sthe same energy and feeling as the firt cd `` wasteing time '' . With driving songs like Opnions and catchy punk/hip hop songs like cadilac , the cd has a fresh new sound and shows mest in out to take over the punk scene , an then the world !!! awsome cd you should make sure to pick it up as soon as possible

 Destination unknown is a truely amazing cd.Mest is an awesome punk band and the songs onDestination Unknown prove it.This is truely the best cd to come out in a long time !!
 M.E.S.T. is a band many people can get into , with catchy lyrics and great sound , i beleive there is a song for everyone that listens to M.E.S.T. It 's really hard to find a band , which every album they 've written is great ! Not only after buying `` Destination Unknown '' , I would consided listening to
 This album is a very good CD from the Punk rock group from Chicago . I found myself having favorite songs at different times . Here are my favorites in no particular order . Opinions , Cadillac , Drawing Board , Yesterday , Breaking Down , Living Dead , and Misunderstood . This CD is great and you should own it . If you want total 5 star mest quality then you should buy Wasting Time -LRB- My favorite CD of all time -RRB- I will love Mest ' Music until I die or they turn into some mutated form resembling Sum 41 ... I Miss you tonight ... Rich M
 MEST inporticular , are a super rad band . They have a laid-back california punk rock sound . This is , by far , their best album . I think you should get every album , or at least this album . Their hit song is Catellac . I heard it from MTV2 , and that was all it took to hook me on to them . That weekend I got that CD . Let me tell you , that was the best investment I 've ever made . If you like Blink182 , you 'll love MEST ! The only thing that I regret about learning about MEST is that I ca n't see them in concert or a while . So pleeeese get this CD , you wo n't be disapointed , TRUST ME !!
 When I first heard of MEST I thought they would be just another pop-punk band that sings about stupid things . Well I was totally wrong . When I but CD in my CD player I was blown away . Like the other reviewers have said
 I actually purchased a copy of this album years ago , but it was stolen some time later . I was pretty excited to see this item and could n't wait to purchase it , despite having not listened to it in literally years . The album is great from start to finish with catchy lyrics you ca n't help sing along to and contagious energy . I love to listen to it when I 'm driving ; it seems to always put me in a great mood . This album is also great for anyone who likes music like Goldfinger , New Found Glory , or Good Charlotte . It 's got some real attitude and serves as a good anthem for people who are growing and figuring out where they 're headed in life , often with jaded undertones . I highly recommend this to others ! Enjoy !
 Ten years ago , the only music that I knew existed was country and top 40 pop . Then I discovered Mest . Well actually a friend of mine did , but my life was literally changed forever . Who knew that there was an entire remarkable genre of music that was not even played on the radio ? I could not get enough and to this day I still love Destination Unknown . They may not have the most clever lyrics or unique musical style , but to me it is where my musical journey began . I would give it 10 stars if I could !
 NOW I DONT HAVE ANY OF THEIR CD 'S BUT I HAVE BURNED ALL OF THEIR SONGS ON TO A CD . . AND THEY ALL GREAT . . SO I THINK YOU SHOULD BUY ALL OF THEM . . BECAUSE THEY ALL ROCK !
 There are songs on this album that are really great , rich in emotive content and with huge hooks . These songs are chelsea , yesterday , drawing board , living dead -LRB- and the excellent hidden track -RRB- , aswell as a few others . But there are a few songs which are truly shocking . Really bog-standard pop-punk which sound like they were written in 5 minutes after listening to blink 182 -LRB- do n't get me wrong - great band -RRB- , just to fill the album up . These are songs like breaking down and f ** d up kid . But if you can look past the few bad songs , this album is mostly fantastic . Hopefully by the next album they would have stopped doing bad songs , and spent more time doing more great songs which they are definetly capable of . They can really pull ska off aswell .
 if i could , i would give this a thousand stars , download one of any of thier songs and see what i mean , just buy this no matter what .
 this cd rocks , every song on there is worth listening too . .
 I 'm about to start reviewing tons of cds based on my judgment of great melodic content . Mest has definitely got a good thing going on right now . When I like I band I first look for the music behind the voice . Does it sound good ? Does it give you chills when they hit certain notes ? Mest hits those qualifications with flying colors . Great sound ! Great vocals ! My favorite tracks on the cd would be ... 1 . It 's Over2 . Mother 's Prayer3 . Living DeadIf you look for the same things in music as I do then this cd should definitely be put on your Christmas , Birthday , or anything list !
 WoW ! This CD kicks butt ! All the songs are really catchy . It especially jumps out to me because the lyrics have a lot to do with my situation , so maybe I 'm a bit biased because of that . But I luv all the songs on here ! You should def . invest in this CD !
 mest , the group better than all of the rest . this rock/punk band caught my attention when my sister bought it . at first i was like ` oh no ! another stupid rap CD ! ' but after i heard the whole cd , i wanted to have one of my own . so , im getting one for christmas.i think the best song on this whole CD is song 12 , Drawing Board . it reminds me of myself trying to do something right but i end up having to do it all over again trying to please someone .
 hey guys , Everyone should check out mest . they r an awesome band . if u like bands like blink 182 and sum 41 u will luv mest . they are from IL and they rock !! All their songs r orignal and so much fun to listen to and dance to . everyone should buy their new cd destination unknown . and after u listen to it and luv it cause i know u will then u can buy their other 2 cds which are also great !!!! got ne questions let me know I will tell all !!!! Tracey
 One of their best albums . I have the other two -LRB- Wasting time and Mo ' Money Mo ' 40 ` z -RRB- which are still good but I love ` Destination Unknown . ' It 's got songs that everyone can relate to .
 hey kids , if u love to listen to a mix of hard af soft guitar licks and some kick-ass lyrics , then mest is definately your band . The chicago foursome 's new album Destination Unknown is a great album and has a lot of great songs . The songs are great for letting a friend know he needs to get over his g/f -LRB- its over -RRB- and/or knowing everything wil be alright in a matter of time -LRB- mothers prayer -RRB- . There are plenty of songs for just about whatever nood ur in . Give it a listen and if u like this type of music then u wont be disappointed .
 This one of my favorite albums . If you like Green Day or Blink , or just wnat to listen to some awsome pop/punk music , I suggest that you go out and by this album . I also suggest that you go out and see MEST aoon . I 've seen them twice and they put on a kick-butt ... show .
 hey anyone who hasnt heard of Mest before and likes punk should buy this cd . Mest have a number of great tracks on this cd . The best in my opinion is CADILLAC -LRB- listen to it below -RRB- . I purchased this cd the day it came out and i saw mest on the 16th of this month at the White Rabbit in san antonio . It was awsome.BUY THIS CD
 Everyone , who 's EVERYONE , knows that MEST is just THE coolest pop/melo/punk band around ! Destination Unknown is an explosive cd that 's BOUND to pump you up . Unlike some cds , there 's not one song on the whole cd that you skip over . Seriously ... if u want some energy , fun , and music to put you in a GREAT mood , you should get this cd . It 's a MUST !!! I ca n't live without mine !
 If you already like Mest , or u r looking for a new great punk band to listen to , this mest cd is a must buy ! my favorite song is '' drawing board '' . . it is also on their other cd !! buy both of them !!
 Mest is a pop-punk quartet from Chicago 's south side . This album really shows their development as musicians and lyricists , as well as reaffirms their talent for writing catchy songs . Perhaps you 've heard their singles `` what 's the dillio '' or `` Cadillac '' on the radio , but they go deeper than that on this album . Mest 's music can appeal to all types of people ; part of their greatness is their ability to write songs that any listener can relate to . The lyrics are simple but truthful . I suggest you check out Mest , they are one of my favorite bands , cool guys , and great live .
 Mest is one of the many bands that can actually come up with great music . They write lyrics that actually can get somebody up when they 're feeling down . It 's a CD that people can not just simply pass over . The powerful lyrics and great sound are a great combination . Mest just keeps coming up with better CDs . Each song varies greatly , in a good way . This CD is worth every single penny and Destination Unknown has been a favorite among my friends , even though they listen to sappy love songs , they enjoy the sound of Mest . GO BUY IT NOW ... Destination Unknown !!
 I think that MEST is a little different from all the other so-called pop-punk bands . They have the catchy tunes and the sing-a-long lyrics down , but along with something extra . MEST includes horns and a bit of ska into their songs on this new album , to give it a bit of a twist . They also have some rap in their songs , like `` Cadillac '' which makes it more interesting than your usual Blink 182 band . Destination Unknown , along with their old album Wasting Time , is a great album that you will not be able to stop listening to . Go out and buy it , NOW !
 If you like upbeat punk rock , this CD is for you . It is full of awesome songs -LRB- check out `` Yesterday '' -RRB- . Be sure to catch these guys on tour . They 're shows rock !

 Mest is the greatest band of all time , I highly recommend that you go out and buy the Waisting Time CD , you will not be disappointed ...
 Mest may just seem like another one of the power punk groups that have come about in the last couple years , but they really have their own style that they bring which helps set them apart from other bands of this nature . The catchy pop-punk 4-some has released a new album `` Destination Unknown '' . This is the southside Chicago punkers 3rd album . The variations of melodic punk songs makes the albums so significant . With their first single `` Cadillac '' , rawked the air ways in philly and all over the u.s. . The album includes singles such as `` Cadillac '' and `` Mother 's Prayer '' . Out of 5 Stars , The album is a over all 4 out of 5 .
 Destination Unknown by Mest , is such a great CD , their songs are songs that people can relate to , and the catchyness of the songs will stick in your head . This Cd is by far the best cd i 've heard yet .
 Mest 's newest CD , Destination Unknown , is one of the greatest CDs out there ! The songs on this CD have great beats and awesome lyrics ! Its a fun CD from one of the greatest bands out there ! If you dont already have it ... GO BUY IT !! It is well worth the money !
 These two cd 's from MEST are incredible . They just keep getting better and better . They 're cd 's are n't only good but so are their shows . I 've seen them in concert twice and they were incredible . Their music is n't like other music , it has a creative touch to punk music . Their new cd Destination Unknown is very creative . They added so much more from their cd Wasting Time . I would recomend checking MEST out .
 Mest 's C.D. Destination Unknown is by far the best new album to come out this year ... With there powerful lyrics and catchy chords ... This Band Rocks
 Mest is flippin great . I have seen them 4 times in concert . They are so awesome . I have all of their cd 's and they are all great . There is n't a song I do n't like . They have fun popish punk that you can rock out to . they have more punky punk that is on their first cd -LRB- Mo money mo 40 's -RRB- and they have some sort of ska type rock out music that is just fun . They are rad .
 iT STARTED WHEN my brother just started playing mests wasting time in the car all the time . I ended up going to 2 of their concerts and memerizing all the lyrics to all of their songs.Destination UNknown is definetely a must-buy album . Mests punk-pop is suitable for most types . Thier reggae song reason is good for the more mellow types . with 16 action-packed songs -LRB- 2 secret tracks -RRB- you will not be able to keep any of the songs out of your head.Randy Tesser
 All I got ta say is that this CD rocks . Regardless of what those redundant critics say about how Mest does n't do anything new to the punk scene , well they are wrong . Mest brings a big mix of ska , rock , emo and puts them all into one CD . I could n't be more happier when listening to each and every song on the CD . There are not many bands that can put out a CD and you listen to every single track . If you like punk , ska , rock , alternative , emo , etc. , buy this CD and their other CD 's .
 Mest 's `` Destination Unkown '' is awesome ! The guys combined fresh sounds with great lyrics to make a rockin ' album . I highly recommend it if you 're into bands like Good Charlotte and New Found Glory .
 I have been a fan of Mest since `` Wasting Time '' came out . The first CD was amazing and Destination Unknown was a great follow up . All the songs on this CD are great . Reasons is a little different . It is more reggae and most of the other songs , but the song is one of the best on the CD . The best song on this , I think , is Yesterday . I just love that song . It is great . I saw Mest live a few months ago and they are the nicest guys you could ever meet . I got their autographs and pictures with all of them . This CD is a must have for everyone . This CD can appeal to everyone , even if you do n't listen to punk . And if you got a chance go see them live . You wo n't be disappointed .
 For those of you who have n't heard this cd yet , youre really missing out . It has some of the best melodies and powerful lyrics . its one of those cds that you can listen to all the way through cause all the songs are just that good .
 The fact that Mest is my favorite band , I of course had high expectations for ` Destination Unknown ' , but listening to it blew me away . This has got to be one of the best pop-punk albums I 've ever owned ... it 's definitely one of their best , if not their best all together . It 's not only got great lyrics & guitar rifts , but it 's got a very melodic feel to it also . I highly recommended picking this album up if you 're into pop-punk , you will NOT be disappointed .

This has got to be one of the best pop-punk albums I 've ever owned ... it 's definitely one of their best , if not their best all together . It 's not only got great lyrics & guitar rifts , but it 's got a very melodic feel to it also . I highly recommended picking this album up if you 're into pop-punk , you will NOT be disappointed .
 Mest is definatly -LRB- spelling ? -RRB- one of the best bands out there right now . Their newest c.d. Destination unknown is VERY good . I like it cause the songs are n't just abou getting girls its about real things and plus ... seeing them live is great !
 Mest takes every genre and mixes it together . They have the pop punk edge , of course , over thuggish R&B ; / Rap beats , and they have some raggae and ballads mixed in there as well . This is teenage angst , with the humor of the Beastie Boys , and the angst of Good Charlotte.They 're really eclectic , and not too hard on the eyes either . : -RRB-
 This CD is awesome , people ! It 's one of the best albums I 've ever bought , and I 've had it for a while now , I listen to it all the time and none of the songs have gotten even near old . Do n't hesitate to buy this cd if you like punk bands like Good Charlotte for example :-RRB- ... even if you 're not into punk , buy it anyway because its really awesome and no one -LRB- that I know -RRB- has said that they do n't like it ... Much love to ya !
 i think the new mest CD is really a good CD . i am a regular punk listener , and this cd is really a jolly cd .
 When I first heard Mest It was the Cadillac song , and I loved it . But I thought it would just be comming off of a -LSB- disappointing -RSB- CD , wow only one good song . WELL I was wrong , all the tracks are amazing . You cant just sit there completly still , you got ta get up and dance . All of the songs totally rock , and now they are my favorite new band !
 The album Destination Unknown by mest is awesome . The music is great to jam to and the songs are fun to sing along to . If you like Good Charlotte then you should definitly like these guys . The music is not too heavy , it is perfect to just jump around to .

 Destination Unknown was an instant hit with me I loved it ! After listening to it for the first time I was wanting to roll in a cadillac down the small town streets of Iowa where I live ... Ok so maybe Iowa is n't the best place to roll in a cadillac but that does n't matter ! what matters is that this CD is just the coolest thing . the instant it was in my CD player the volume was cranked up to be sure and vibrate the floor . The CD was fun but also had a lot of truth to it as in the songs Another Day , Fucted up Kid and Mothers Prayer just to name a few , but its hard to name specific songs that should be listened to because the whole CD just flat out rules and I highly recommend it ! ...
 This album is great . I think that it is better than the last two albums . Mest is a great band with great lyrics . They write about what they know and have expeinced . When I listen to the album , it makes me really energized and ready to go .
 I do n't listen to this album very much but when I do , I play it over twice . It 's really good , I quite honestly do n't have to words to describe how genius the dudes of Mest are . You just have to listen and buy it ! Oh yeah see them in concert if you have n't ... you 're missing a lot !
 Ok , listen if you havent heard of Mest then you have been lost ! This has to be the best new and upcoming punk band of its time ! Tony , Jeremiah , Matt and Nick are the coolest and funniest people i have ever met ! They put on a great show too ! If you listen to their music it combines the spirit of punk with great lyrics that cover every acspect of growing up ! These guys could easily be the next Blink-182 ! I think their cd is just as good as blinks too ! If you have any common sense you will go out there and check these guys out ! buy some cds and show up at one of their shows ! You 'll be glad you did !!! ...
 This CD is amazing it has fast catchy songs . Another Day got me hooked up to the band and I purchased their CD . It is excellent do n't waste 1 more second ... it 's in this website one of the greatest Cds that you will enjoy 4ever !
 if u love catchy up beat punk music then this is the band for you !!! they have a lot to offer and show it on all of their albums . their songs are full of energy and they show it on this album . this is my fav mest album and i recomend it !!!!
 I dont even know where to start ... so here 's the dillio . . this cd is great . It 's a punk cd with great lyrics and a great beat . The lyrics are great because they relate to a lot of the kids that are gon na be buying this album . Its well over worth the money you will pay for it . I bought this album in March and I have listened to it everyday since i got it . Also if you like this album check out Mest on tour because I have seen them and they are great . I definitely would give this cd a 5 because there are no improvments that could be made ! This cd really turned me into a mest headd !
 WOW ! This cd is awesome ! I have all of theirs and this one is by far the best . Anyone who does n't have it should go and pick it up today ! Mest is a pop/punk band who has an awesome style of music . Their lyrics are true and hit close to home . Please buy this cd ! xoxo
 The latest CD by MEst ... DESTINATION UNKNOWN ... has beats powerful enough to drive anyone home and keep them there ... The new album is on the attack and has already one over the hearts of millions ... ok ... im not positive on that ... but i know it has one over thousands ... hundred 's of thousands ... Since the release of their first single `` Cadillac , '' the CD has really taken off ... who would of ever thought to include a little bit of hip hop and punk rock music in one song ... I 'll tell you who ... MEST ... the addition of a turntable in `` Cadillac '' is the coolest sound ever ... which is one reason why everyone should own this CD ... and other Mest albums ... Mest is one of the best punk bands ... I saw them in a conert at the burch hill , in New Jersey , and I had the priviledge to talk to Tony ... -LRB- for a matter of moments . . -RRB- but that was long enough to find out how humble the band really is ... They are the coolest guys , and deserve to have their CD bought and owned by everyone ... not just kids who listen to Punk rock music either ... so everyone who reads this review , make it a point to make one new person listen to Mest ... if they havent heard of them already ... MEST IS THE PUNK ROCK MUSIC THAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO HAVE IN THEIR CD PLAYER ... I Havent taken my CD out since it came out ... and that was a sad day , cause I had to move my other Mest CD ... WASTING TIME ... to my other CD player ... but it was well worth it ... cause both albums kick serious ass ... and the new one is fresh and pumpin ... There 's only one thing left to say about it ... it is a MUST have for any music fan ... ANY music fan ... it is that good ... So hurry out to the stores and buy your copy of Mest 's latest CD . . DESTINATION UNKNOWN ... . keep on rocking ... and show some EMO PUNK love ... . E -LRB- _ -LRB- V -RRB- _ -RRB- oBoY
 Hi . . I am mallory , a HUGE Mest fan . . I am suggesting to everyne to go get the mest cd , Destination Unknown . I already got 3 of my friends to buy the cd . I was jammin and they heard and were like `` omg , who is this . . they are really good ! '' I think personally the BEST songs are Drawing Board , and Without you . . yet there are n't any BAD songs on the cd . Normally I put the CD on RANDOM . . and any song that comes on is ALWAYS a good one . See those samples on this website ? I think YOU . . -LRB- yes , I mean you -RRB- should go listen to the samples of Mest 's cd . . and I garentee you 'll like it ! I PROMISE YOU 'LL LIKE THIS CD . . and hey , who would want to miss out on seeing the HOT GUYS inside the CD cover ? who could resist ? ...
 I love Mest ... I 've seen them in concert , and they 're awesome . Tony is great . This is the 3rd CD and I think it 's pretty kickass . Sure , some of the songs are n't so lyrically great , but it 's fun to listen to . The songs that stand out are `` Drawing Board '' -LRB- who does n't like this song ? -RRB- `` Cadillac '' -LRB- for you people with some ghetto in you -RRB- and `` Yesterday '' -LRB- vocals by Jeremiah , sounds awesome -RRB- . Some of the weirder songs are `` Reason '' and the hidden track . They 're both cool , just ... too jamacian . Oh well , I still listen to them.If you want a nice variety in music and fun music to listen to whenever , get this CD.Whether they 're punk , pop-punk , or pop-rock , they 're good .
 Destination Unknown by Mest is a remarkable CD . The CD mixes sounds of melodic and harmonic music together . With a unique sound and more than one singer , this band really has it together . With Nick on the drums to keep the beat , Matt -LRB- Mest 's bassist -RRB- , Jeremiah and Tony on the guitar and leading the vocals , the CD comes out on top . The CD includes `` Drawing Board '' which was a track on their previous album `` Wasting Time . '' It was a great choice as a track to reuse , with it 's tune being slightly more mellow and all . Also , on this CD , the lyrics to each and every song have meaning and I can find myself relating to many . So , if you do n't have this CD already , I very much suggest going and buying it .
 I recently bought the new Mest CD `` Destination Unknown '' and I love it !! It has catchy lyrics and great sounds ! If you 're a fan of Mest or not , I truly recommend you get their CD `` Destination Unknown '' .
 Mest is a great band that hails from Chicago . Anybody that listens to Good Charlotte , New Found Glory , Blink 182 , or Sum 41 then you will like this band . Their latest CD is a good follow up to their debut album , Wasting Time . Although I do think that Wasting Time is a better all around CD , Destination Unknown has a lot of catchy tracks . It has many good songs that can relate to anybodys daily life . The guitar parts in all the songs are also very catchy because they throw a variety of riffs and chords that mix very well . So anybody that likes emo punk should go out and buy this CD .
 ok ... . mest may not be that well known , but they sure do rock ! `` destination unknown '' is like there greatest album . it is sooo great i listen to it juss about everyday for hours . well the best song on the cd is `` drawing board '' . i can listen to that song all day everyday , and sumtimes i do . that song will never be played out for me . well all the songs on this cd are original and worthy of you listening to them . so if you do not have this cd GO GET IT NOW !!!
 If you havent heard of this rawkin band mest , get -LSB- up -RSB- and buy destination unknown !!! it rocks your socks off and it dont matter what music you like . what are you waitin for , go get it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 I first heard of Mest after missing them play as the opening band to Good Charlotte when the audience was jumping so much that we broke the floor during another opening act . Regardless , I saw the frontman and thought he was hot and so I got the cd . It is sooo awesome . My favorite song is Cadillac , but the entire cd is great . Its mostly peppy surferish punk is addictive . Destination
 Destination Unknown is one rockin CD ! Mest has grown a lot since their last album but are still bustin out . I definately recommend this CD to anyone who likes fun music !!!

 This is an Awesome cd if you like pop/punk . These guys rock out and kick -LSB- butt -RSB- . You can really relate to the lyrics , and the vocals are phat . Make sure to check out their other cd 's also , no album is even close to average ... . they 're awesome : -RRB-
 This album is awesome !!! Its fast pop/punk sounds makes it for everyone . You can pop it in the cd player and just sing with the songs . Me and my friends always put on cadillac when we 're in her convertable and sing really loud so the other cars can hear us . The best thing about this album is that it really is for anybody excepts ur grandparents . My mom even likes a couple of the songs which is very suprising considering i listen to `` noise '' . It just goes to show that MEST is such good band . I personally think that the CD rocks and its my favorite SOO ... GO OUT AND BUY IT !!!! DUHHH !
 Destination Unknown is an album you can put in your cd player and let it go for 2 staight hours and love every song . You can tell that these guys are in the buisness to have fun and play how they want to play . It may seem like trendy punk to some but their just sayin it to sound like they are all about the underground . MEST is an awesome band , their lyrics mixed with cool guitar rythms makes this one of my favorite cd 's in about 3 years . This album is awesome .
 M.E.S.T. 's new CD is one you can push the loop button on the CD player . It is good enough to listen to over and over again . The songs are ones you want to sing along to , and the lyrics are ones you can relate to . Their up beat catchie beat is one you want to have bumping in your stereo or car . You ca n't go worng with buying this CD !
 First of I have to say , I do n't personally own the Destination Unknown cd , but I have heard the songs from it and let me say that they are great . I recently saw Mest in concert and the songs from Destination Unknown were so awesome . Personally , anything from Mest is good to me , but the difference and variation of these songs is just the best . If this is your type of music , I 'm sure that you 'll love Destination Unknown .
 hey , in mests second CD the band really sounds great , i can t stop listing to it , it is a staple in my every day music choices . My band plays mest songs constantly , its great . I LOVE MEST !!!!
 I just started listenin to Mest and Im hooked . Its been like a month since i heard them in `` The innocent '' so I bought this cd and now I ca n't stop listening to it I wish that everyone could listen to this so I tell you now . BUY THIS !! It may be the bes CD EVER . Trust me .
 I think that this CD is a great CD and if you like any bands like , the Ataris , Green Day , A New Found Glory , Fenix TX or other bands of that nature then you will love this CD . It is full of catchy songs with great lyrics . You should definitely buy this album , it 's great !
 This CD is KICKIN ! If you 've listened to any of their other cds , this would come as no surprise to you . . MEST ROCKS ! They have their own twist on punk rawk and this CD holds no exception . I ca n't get enough of it !! They 're unlike anyone else out there and I highly suggest this album ! It 's music that makes you bounce off the walls and it just puts you in a good mood . I have n't heard anyone that 's listened to them ever say one negative thing about them , even in the least bit ! So I think you should go out and buy this CD right now ! Forget about N'sync , Britney or any of the latest pop artists . . get in touch with your punked-out self and listen to some awesome music ! You wo n't regret it , I promise !! The first time I heard MEST was at a Good Charlotte concert . . they came on , played 30 seconds of their first song and that was it . . I WAS IN LOVE ! As soon as they finished , I went straight over and bought Destination Unknown . The CD never leaves my CD player . Show some love for the punk rawk scene and pick up the album !!
 I think mest 's album `` Destination Unknown '' is the best album i own ! Mest is a great & talented band from Chicago Illinois . I got the album the first day it came out & cant stop listening to it ! It 's one of those albums that u just dont get tired of ! I 've also seen them live . They were amazing !! Mest plays mostly punk style music . They r so awesome ! If there is any album you are gon na buy , then buy this one !! Jason *
 u must buy this cd now . it is amazing . go buy it . no one should be without this album .
 I saw these guys in concert , they rock . This is VERY TYPICAL pop/punk and I like it . The lyrics and fun and meaningful , great to sing and easy to learn . You need this CD . I 'd have to say its even a little better then their first CD . I would recomend this CD to anyone who likes pop/punk . If you enjoy Blink 182 , goldfinger , good charlotte , sum 41 ... well , get this . You 'll like it . I got it w/o hearing anything first and I love it .
 After the band 's major-label debut was greeted with a lukewarm reception , Mest 's sophomore disc shows the band treading into somewhat unfamiliar territory for the Chicago foursome . Most strikingly , Mest peppers their punky power pop with Sugar Ray-like pseudo-hip-hop , even employing Young MC to add production to the most guilty tracks
 These guys really know how to rock ! I first got their second CD wasting time and I was hooked . Destination Unkown -LRB- their 3rd -RRB- is even better . The vocals , guitar riffs , everything about them is awesome . They are the best band ever ! I recommend
 This is one of the best cds I have ever heard . Its great if u like Alt Rock .
 First of all , ANY mest album is going to kick . If you couldnt get enough of Wasting Time , you 'll be blown away by Destination Unknown . I know youll endulge in it even if you 've never even heard of Mest .
 For those of you who do not know who Mest is they are a punk rock band . If you like bands like Blnk 182 , Something Corporate , and New Found Glory then you will like Mest . Their new CD Destination Unknown is full of catchy up beat songs . One of my favorite songs on the CD is Chelsea . It starts of kind of slow but it is very up beat once after the first couple of seconds . If you like songs with a hard beat to it then you will love the song Cadillac . It has a catchy hard beat to it with awsome lyrics . Destination Unknown has a variety of different sounds and it is definetly worth buying .
 I used to work in a cd store and when `` Destination Unknown '' first came out in was in demand and was hard to find . I was able to purchase it the day it came out and I dont regret it at all ! The songs lyrics are great with some catchy music . In my eyes this cd is awesome and i would suggest it to anyone to buy it ... and if you get chance to see them in your town ... i highly suggest it ... their live show is the best !!!
 After I heard one song off the album , Cadillac , I was hooked . Than I listened to Drawing Board , and that became one of my instant all time favorite songs . I picked up my guitar right away and tried to learn these two songs . The album is great , every song on it is put together real well , and the band has a real postive sound , very enjoyable to listen too . I 've listen to the whole record so many times since I bought it , it 's great record . If you get the chance see them in concert , they are awsome !!! I saw them with Unwritten Law and Sugarcult in Ventura and it was one of the best concerts I 've ever been to . The band members are really cool too , I got a chance to say hello to couple of them and they were real tight guys . So do yourself a favor and do Mest a favor and by the CD it is definetly worth it .
 I think this CD deserves way more than 5 stars , but thats the highest I could rate it ! Everyone should own this awesome CD , and you should also own the rest of their CD 's ; they 're all great ! Not only do these guys write the best music but what they write about is so real ! We are all able to relate to their songs ! Even if they sing about girls , what they say is very true ! When I 'm down and I need to get my mind of a guy I just simply listen to their CD and all my problems go away ! So you should really get this CD now ! Okay Thanks !
 Mest is a Chicago-based fun loving pop punk rock band with two great CDs . Destination Unknown , their new CD , had many fans concerned . Could it be as spirited and original as Wasting Time ? Destination Unknown proved itself to be a CD with fun yet moving lyrics put together with melodic and upbeat music . Songs like Cadillac make you want to dance , and songs like Reason and Mother 's Prayer let you sit back and enjoy it . This CD is great for anyone who loves to have fun and rock out ! If you like bands such as Good Charlotte , Goldfinger or New Found Glory I highly recommend you check these guys out . You wo n't regret it !
 with ther influnced by reggae hip hop and of course rock this album is one of the best to come out of the new and up coming punk scene .

 anyone who has not yet bought Mest 's new CD Destination Unknown is a FOOL ! It has to be one of the greatest CD 's known to man . If you 're a punk rock fan , this CD is an absolute must , and even if you 're not into the genre , the CD is still highly worth considering . The album 's variety of songs suit the tastes of many music lovers , as the band goes from pop punk in most of the songs to a few alternative ones , which are also works of art . Their music contains a mixture of deep , heartfelt lyrics and strong rhythms . This homegrown Chicago band of 4 is now becoming the greatest band yet ! So help them out and buy their new CD to hear their music and promote their band ! And if your a parent lookin for a CD for you son but dont wan na get one filled with curses and noise then dont even worry.This CD contains songs with meaning and a reason for them . Sure there may be a few curses in them but these days every Band curses in their songs . The first single , Cadillac , struggled to gain radio airplay however this song with its catchy drum beat and unforgettable tune became a hit in several American towns and cities . One of their slower , more toned down songs is Mothers Prayer . With this song they talk about mother and more personal issues.It 's a well written song and definitely a song i think anyone can enjoy . Another song , It 's over , is a song very relatable to the audience which Mest has so rightfully gained this past year . Mest 's drive to the top will continue this Summer on Maverick Records with tours across the country to gain more media exposure . This album is just the beginning , and you should expect to see them on MTV soon .
 Mest new album Destination Unknown has a different sound then there last album Wasting Time which makes the new album so much better . With their rock riffs and some ska sounding songs , this CD is one of the better CD 's out there by a rock band who writes their own songs . The content of the songs are about relationships and everyday things most kids can relate to . Its a great CD and should be owned by all !
 this cd is a good cd to listen to while you are skatboarding or even just sittin around the house , there are no songs that are `` not worth listening to '' they all are very good . .
 Destination Unknown is by far one of my favorite CD 's . Mest knows how to make a kick-a $ $ album . I highly recommend this CD to any of those who do n't have it ! I can garuntee that you wo n't regret buying it !

Any teen could relate Mest 's mindbending , heartbreaking lyrics . Everyone knows that every party needs some music . Punkrocking to life , every party needs some MEST . If your into the pop-punk styles of Good Charolotte , Lit , MxPx , or the Ataris , you have got to buy this today !! : -RRB-

Wasting Time , and Mo'Money Mo ' 40 's ! if you really like them , you should check them out in concert . MEST ROCZ !
 What can I say , this cd is awesome . If you dont buy this cd , you 're insane . A few weeks go , I tried to start a band , but it didnt work . So , my friend told me to listen to this group because they were really good . After I listened to the cd , I got up the courage to start a band again . I dont have one yet , but I wil soon . I definetly suggest that you listen to this cd .
 ok first of all if you have this cd and dont have wasting time or mo money mo forty 's got out and get them NOW !!!!! this cd is truely one of my favorites . All the songs on this cd kick majorly -LRB- including the hidden song -RRB- . this isnt really a hardcore kind so all u blink 182 and sum 41 fans will love it . but also if your into bands like goldfinger , the ataris , and the vandals you will love it also personally i give it three thumbs up !
 This is the best cd i ever bought for under 10 dollars . Not only they are good looking but they know how to make great ... music . If you have money to spare i would deffinitly buy Mest 's destination unknown . You 'll be very sorry if you did not buy this cd .
 This is my Favorite CD , a great combination of punk/pop beats and awesome lyrics ... it 's just what i need to keep me goin throgh the day ... Perhaps the best song to wake up to in the morning is Cadillac , the first single off the cd , and not only is there great beats but also a softer side that can be heard in Drawing Board -LRB- my personal fav -RRB- , Chelsea , and Mother 's Prayer -LRB- the second single off the cd -RRB- . Mest writes all of their own stuff , and it shows in how well they can relate to their fans in their music ... all in all this is a great cd and well worth it ... MO ' 40 ` Z. ...
 this album is the best album i have heard in a while . i have recently had trouble with girls and life and people . i bought this album thinking it was just cool music but it was so much more than that for me it was my life on a cd like that songs `` opinions '' that night i bought the cd i was depressed about pleasing people and that song just set me free the words i cant do wrong i cant do write i feel so alone tonight i wish that you were here that just said everything i ment to say it made me cry the first time it was an awsome experience . i play guitar and ive been trying to write a song for a girl but i couldnt get the words to say and then i flipped the cd to song 12 `` drawing board '' man that song kicks some ... i love the lyrics in that song . i guess what im trying to say this cd is just everything to me i love it to death it has all my feelings in it i love it . i love you mest -LRB- as friends lol -RRB- later ...
 Mest is a great band . They are not as pop oriented as some of the bands out their but the cd still has some of that sort of feel . They definately are n't hardcore or anything , but it is still good music . All of the songs are super catchy . I listen to this cd all of the time and my friends even like them now . You wo n't regret buying this cd .

 Hey everyone I think that all of you should buy or listen to this cd I have listened to all mest 's cds and everytime i find something new . I know that you think bands ca n't get better over time well this one does . I took the cds over t my friends houses and the next day they all went buy both of them because they were so good . Also you might think that when you hear and band play all of their songs sound the same well not mest no not them I play the guitar and everyday i learn a different song by them and none of their tabs are the same . If you look up the tabs by them you will see that they have new ideas for each song they write and you wont be disapponted with their songs because each one starts and ends different . It also does n't matter what kind of music you listen to if you heard someone listening to Mest you will love them too . At their concerts they are all nice guys I have gotten so much stuff from them and thats where i started liking them at the concert I liked them so much after the concert I went to the store and bought a cd player just so I could listen to it right away . Anways this is the best band ever and if you like punk , rock , alternative , etc. . I know you will love them too .
 This album rocks because the music sound cool . you can really get into the songs cause it has some fast beats that you just was to get up and go wild . I recommend this albums to people who like good punk rock music with a bit of hip hop . They have a beat like no other band that i know and they sound awsome . If you get this album you wont regret it .
 If you 're sick of that stupid boy band garbage , this CD is for you . The sound is awesome and everyone gets the album will get a kick out of it . MEST ROCKS !
 first time i listened to this i thought `` hmm ok '' second time i was alrready singing along , to my friends horror , but since i play yhis cd soo much they sing along to and are longer distressed . not as great as the first one but still a keeper
 The New cd by mest is the best yet -LRB- the other two are also very awesome -RRB- but this takes the cake.This cd is great to listen any time.This cd is one of those cds were you just do n't skip a song.All the songs are catchy.If you love catchy poppy-punk music you 'll love Mest .
 I like them . Their songs have meaning and a good beat . If you like Pop-Punk you will probably like this CD . They are not well known , but they should be . This CD , is better then their last one but they 're still good , and this Cd is worth buying .
 this was the first MEST album that i bought , after a friend had introduced me to this awesome band . i love the DESTINATION UNKNOWN cd because many of the songs i can relate to right now , especially `` reason . '' it does n't matter what you music choice is i think anyone would love this album . go buy it . now .
 In case you have n't heard , Mest is one of the best new bands quickly climbing to fame . They are highly energetic and this cd is filled with cathcy melodies and lyrics that you can easily relate to . This cd is my official friday night cd to get ready to party . I have played it for friends and they all went out and bought it right away . If you ever get the chance to see them live , DO IT ! They are a blast to watch . Go out an and buy Desination Unknown and get ready for a great musical experience !
 well i have been a fan of mest for a little over 5 years . i can honestly say they have changed musicaly , if you have heard mo money mo 40 ' z and then heard destnation unknown you would be shocked . i love mo money but they now have a more poppie sound to them and they are more emo . i still love the guys but if u listen to all 3 of there cd 's you would be in shock they each have a diffrent sound to them and as tony went through a lot he wrote about and well its emo , so you can buy destenation unknown its a good cd but dont be shocked it has some great beats and the songs will stay in your head
 MEST 's `` Destination Unknown '' is a great CD . All the songs on it are good , and they are also mixed good . Mest lyrics are some of the best I have ever heard , and keep you listening for on and on . I could listen to `` Destination Unknown '' for days . And I can not forget to mention that the guitar work done by Jeremiah Rangel and Tony Lovato is AWESOME !!!!!!
 This album is not at all a disappointment . Mest deliver another pop-punk based album full of catchy riffs and great vocal harmonies . MTV friendly `` cadillac '' is a true delight combining some slick DJ-ing in the chorus . Highlights of this album include : OpinionsAnother DayReasonIt 's OverChelseaAlso feautured on this album , is `` Drawing Board '' , previously featured on the band 's second album `` Wasting Time '' and sounds better ever . `` Destination Unknown '' proves that Mest are able to write consistantly great catchy pop-punk songs , and wo n't be going away soon . These are going to be big .
 This CD is amazing . When ya listen to Mest , it 's like you 're in a totally different place . . yeah some of the songs are a bit emotional , but that 's emo for ya ! :-RRB- Honestly , this is a really good CD and it 's worth every cent you pay for it . . OHH YEAH
 With their newest release , `` Destination Unknown , '' Mest has truely made a name for themselves in the music business .

Although new to the music world with only their second release , Mest has demonstrated their potential to succeed in the future .
 Haling from the chicagoland area Mesth turned into one of todays top punk acts . The new CD `` Destination Unknown '' is a top three of this summer and a must have CD .
 I first got hooked on Good Charlotte and went to buy the cd on amazon . It said , `` People who bought this also bought . . '' and it said MEST ... I listened to a sample of It 's Over ... I downloaded the mp3 . . then I got hooked , Without you and It 's over are my favorite . Im a tru ska punk listener . I was soo mad when they dint go on Warped Tour . anyways , great cd , worth buyin !!

 I have been listening to punk for about 4 years now . My favorite band used to be Good Charlotte , and I thought nothing would be able to change that . I had been listening to `` Wasting Time '' , and `` Mo Money Mo 40z 's '' , but after getting Mest 's Destination Unknown I was blown away by the incredible sound . This album is great for all types of tastes . I feel that this album could be one of few things that old school and new school punk fans can say is unite together ans say is AWESOME ! The voice harmonizations on this album are absolutely beautiful . Mest 's Destination Unknown is one of those album 's that you can put in your player and not have to worry about skipping over the songs you do n't like , because every song is great . On top of the incredible punk sound , the album also gives a great taste of reggae in songs like `` Reason '' , and the hidden track after song 14 . Also , from my personal experiences with `` non-punk listening friends '' , even if one hates new school punk or any punk , it is absolutely impossible to not tap your foot , bob your head , or even jump to the powerful and stimulsting riffs of `` Cadillac '' . Overall , Mest 's album , Destination Unknown , is the only album that I have ever taken time out my day to promote . IT ROCKS!P.S . Their live shows are beyond words .
 I absolutely love this band and the album . This is my favorite of all three so far . I recommend tracks 2 , 11 and 14 as my favorites . This album is great ! Any CD collection containing MEST rocks !
 this is a great cd , it should be compared to blink 182 , new found glory , sum 41 and allister.Mest is a great punk band .
 Well what can I say ? Mest is an awesome , catchy punk-pop band . Ever since my friends ' band , Brodie , went on tour with them and MxPx last Summer , I really got into them , and have grown to love them more and more after each passing day . I would have given Destination Unknown 5 Stars , but I have to save the 5 for future Mest releases . There lyrics and captivating sound will keep anyone busy for hours !
 Mest 's Destination Unkown is a great pop punk for any music lover . It 's a step up from the debut album Wasting Time and provides 13 tracks of punk rock pleasure . I love the whole CD and there 's not one track I skip over ... a rarity in today 's music scene . Also includes special guest Monique Powell of Save Ferris on the Sublime feel track `` Reason '' . A great buy at a great price .
 Ok , peoples ... . Mest is one of the greatest bands . I 've been a fan of there since last October when I saw them in concert with Good Charlotte ... with songs like `` Caddilac '' and `` Mothers Prayer '' what more could you ask for in a band . Great sound , awsome personalities ! , and so far fans that would do anything for them . And they are rock 'n without losing who they are , their roots . They know who they are , they know the sound they are , and wont change it for anything ! The cd is one of the best Album 's i got this year ! The song are really catchy and you 'll know all the words and backround music in about a day or two ! This band ... This CD kicks ... Rawk ON !
 The New MEst Cd Destination Unkown is a great cd . Mest 's Catchy Punk songs really get you going . THere last Cd Wasting Time was also A great album . You must check these guys out . THey are also great live . Mest RULES !
 All the songs on this album are great . i recommend getting wasting time too.Mest is brilliant and just listen to any of their songs and you 'll see what i 'm saying .
 This latest installment of the Mest saga truely has locked them solidly into punk history . In this masterpiece , Mest combines the ability to follow in the footsteps of such bands as Goldfinger , Unwritten Law , and Blink-182 and to try new songwriting styles . A must have for any fan of music .
 Overall I dont think this CD is as bad as post punks say it is . It generally has some easy songs to relate to and they are well written and I thought it was brilliant how Young MC was a guest dj on the song Cadillac and also produced some of the songs on the album and i also like monique powells ' cameo on the album . I reccomend anyone new to punk to buy this album and then support other bands like good charlotte and goldfinger . Its somethiing youll enjoy for many years without getting bored !
 This album is great . I downloaded it from the internet the first time and had to go out and support the band by buying it . I enjoyed it so much I went and got their first album `` Wasting Time '' . Everyone should go out and get the c.d. It 's worth the money !
 Mest rocks ... I just joined their street team ... but I 've been spreading the word about them for a while . When my friends and I went to one of their concerts ... we bought an extra ticket just so we could take another person who didnt know them ... now that person is enlightenedand rockin . `` Wasting Time '' rocked ... but `` Destination Unknown '' kicks -LSB- rear -RSB- . This album will make you want to `` roll with the top down ... seat back '' . Buy their CDs ... Go see them in concert ... they 're awesome ... -LRB- getting MEST up at a concert is a good thing . -RRB-
 This CD is awesome . Its great punk rock . Every song is great and worth listening to.If your a fan of punk or just like music , go out and buy this cd now !!
 This CD is awsome and they put a lot of work into it . You can see it in the excellent songs ! I like Yesterday , Cadillac and Chelsea . They haveAlternative/Mellow/Hard Rock edge . I urge you to but this CD !! You will be eternally Happy if you do !
 I bought this album after a friend recommended it to me , and let me tell you it suprised me ! I was expecting a CD I would listen to a few songs on , but no way ! Every song on here is quality , and I can listen to the CD all the way through every time ! This is a great release by Mest and they have there own original style ! Anyone who likes New Found Glory or Good Charlotte with love them ! They have there own original style and any punk fan should definitely pick this album up ! Some of my favorites
 Hey check it out , Destination unknown is one sweet friggin cd . Anybody who 's human can relate to the lyrics in the songs on this cd . this is there greatest cd to date , with songs like `` cadillac '' , which is just awesome because it 's got a little bit of a `` wicky wickiness '' to it with the turntable action goin on there , it 's just a really fun song , then there 's `` chelsea '' whith its heart-felt lyrics really can get you over a broken heart , these are 2 of my favs on the cd . Each song has it 's own uniqueness to it and it 's just a nice smooth blend of punk rock & emo it 's like nothing else
 I just got this CD today , I have already listened to it about 4 times !!! I highly suggest -LRB- any Mest fan , -RRB- to get this CD.I have got most my friends to worship Mest . It took only 1 time to listen to Cadillac , and 6 of my friends were hooked , then and there !! Great CD!And remember , MEST IS THE BEST !!!!
 MEST 's Destination Unknown is an album you can put in your cd player and let it go for 2 staight hours and love every song . You can tell that these guys are in the buisness to have fun and play how they want to play . It may seem like trendy punk to some but their just sayin it to sound like they are all about the underground . MEST is an awesome band , their lyrics mixed with cool guitar rythms makes this one of my favorite cd 's in about 3 years . This album is awesome .
 Mest is one of the few bands that get better over time . Many become sell out with their new found fame . Not Mest . Their poppy punk emo is just as good , if not better than `` Wasting Time , '' their last CD . Highlights include `` Cadillac , '' which has a great turntable touch to it , very catchy and filled to the top with taent . `` Reason '' sounds a lot like 311 - almost a carribean sound . `` F *** ed up kid '' is an amazing track that I can completely relate to . Powerful and melodic , great , even meaningful lyrics -LRB- part of the chorus sings `` at least i know all the things that i want and its all the things ive got '' -RRB- Last but not least , the heart wrenching almost-a-ballad `` Chelsea '' is touching , sweet , but still fast paced -LRB- a feat in its own -RRB- . Every song is an individual - each has a couple things that are really special . Turntables , vocal techniques , catchy melodies , and cute little suprises throughout the songs . This cd is one that will grow on you each time you listen to it . it is emo at its best - light , fast , witty and sweet , it is completely worth the money . Dont wait another second . Everyone I know who has purchased this CD -LRB- 5 of my close friends -RRB- have enjoeyed every minute of it - it has n't left any of our CD players .
 In case you 've never heard Mest before , you 'd like them if you like Good Charlotte , Goldfinger , New Found Glory , Blink-182 , MxPx , Sugarcult , Student Rick ... bands of that kin . Onto the album ... to be perfectly honest , I was disappointed the first time I popped Destination Unknown into my CD player . On first listen it was not nearly as catchy as a whole as Mest 's second album , Wasting Time . The songs that immediately caught my ear were -LRB- the obvious -RRB- the first single Cadillac , Without You , It 's Over , Misunderstood and Drawing Board -LRB- an insatiably catchy and awesome song , also a re-release originally off of Wasting Time -RRB- . I was unimpressed and sort of threw the CD aside for a few weeks until a Mest concert rolled around . About a week before the show , I decided to give the album a second chance . I 'm so glad I did . This album is well worth any pop punk listener 's money . Mest is one of my top 3 favorite bands . They put on an amazing show , have catchy tunes , and have lyrics with substance . Hard to come across these days - fun music with real lyrics . Anyone can relate to songs like the CD 's opener , Opinions . I also like the diversity , with the reggae inspired Reason and the borderline love song Chelsea -LRB- which I absolutely love ! -RRB- . I honestly love every song on the album except Another Day , and even that 's not that bad . I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes pop punk . If you liked Wasting Time and Mo Money Mo 40oz , you 'll like Destination Unknown . Mest found a great sound and thank goodness they 're sticking to it . All these bands come out feeling the pressure of a follow up album , and they go changing their whole sound ... Not Mest though !! You might need to listen to it twice to really get hooked , but it 's definitely worthy investment .
 my sister 's boyfriend gave me a mest cd once , and said these guys are awesome , so i took a listen , i was really good !!! tony and matt have certainly improved since `` wasting time '' . BEST SONGS1 . Drawing Board - from the first cd , but a classic !!! 2 . Chelsea - a sweet love song that kicks -LSB- butt -RSB- .3 . Cadillac - just a good song , specially when u and ur frineds go crusin .4 . Opinions - awesome song , good chorus5 . Another Day - another just plain great song.these guys are awesome , i hope MTV never finds them . they have a new cd coming this june , ca n't wait !!!
 Mest is definatley one of my favourite bands and all of thier albums are great . They are at the top of the list as far as the pop punk genre goes . The music is fast paced and extremely catchy . If you like Yellowcard , The Starting Line , Green Day , Good Charlotte , Blink 182 and New Found Glory then I recommend Mest.Destination Unknown is a truly amazing cd and deserves to be played loud and often . It is full of up beat catchy songs . The tunes all have the capability of getting stuck in your head . Sure , a lot of the songs are about girls and brokendown relationships , but what do you expect listening to a group of young guys singing about what 's going on in their lives.Some of my favourite songs on the album are : OpinionsCadillacIt 's OverReasonMother 's PrayerIf you liked Mest 's first album then you will definately enjoy this one also . All 14 songs are great , no filler included . I highly recommend Destination Unknown and if you like this one you will be sure to enjoy their other two albums also !
 Let 's start out from hearing the word `` mest '' , you think in your head what the hell does that mean ? Well , for fans of punk rock music , they automatically know that thay are a band . Not , any band , but a band who can jolt out hits such as chelsea and a mothers prayer from destination unkown . With the melodic voices of the two singers they can pretty much turn anything into worthwhile listening . Once you pop this into your cd player , its non stop listening . Right away you can start singing along to their songs . One that truly sticks out would be track number 3 , cadillac . It gives off this feeling of energy that all of their songs have . The harmony these guys can give off is amazing with their , hip-hop/ska/punk sound is off the hook . Need I say more?These guys are are well known , and we sure are going to see more of them in the future . Fans of punk rock or any other music I urge you to go out and by this disc its worth your `` mula '' .
 Another amazing CD by Mest . Destination Unknow is by far the best cd I own . With songs like `` Reason '' , `` Cadilac '' , `` Without You '' and `` Yesterday '' its hard to find any band that comes even close to Mest . If you 're planning on buying a CD that has great songs you 'll never get tired of , pick up Destination Unknown , along with Wasting Time , and Mo Money Mo 40 ` z.
 This cd is one of their great cd 's . I think its the best punk cd since new found glory came out .
 To disreguard Mest as yet just another pop-punk band is wrong . This Chicago foursome is more then that . Yes , the music is poppy , and its punk but the overfall feeling of this album is almost perfection . Mest is better then any pop punk got there except for of course blink182 and the godfather of pop-punk Billie Joe and Green Day . What seperates Mest from other pop punk acts is there song writing capability . With sum41 you have maybe 5 good songs and the other 8 is just filler . With Mest , thats not the case . Every song is near perfection for Mest . . NO FILLER . . Just really good music ... If you want an album with some life and every track that you can get down too then buy Mest 's '' destination unknown '' . You wont be dissappointed ! Make sure to support another local Chicago band ... SHOWOFF ... Check 'em Out ! - Wonka -LRB- Eric -RRB-
 im shamed to live in florida cause of the user below . . god , i hate florida . . anyhow , mest has always been very good and i know these guys have talent . i know people who went to their shows live . the cd is full of energy and great lyrics . the songs are only a carbon copy when you search for millions of singers and find out they may have the same influences . god guys , use your brain .
 Mest is such a great band . People probably always say that about them but it 's true . They are so incredibly wonderful . Their songs are just so cool and fun to listen to . I mean if you 're the kind of person that likes punk rock but also likes the mellow kind of rock you have to get `` Destination Unknown '' . The have both kinds of rock in that cd . If you feel like you 're not having the best day and want to cheer up a little , put in `` Destination Unknown '' and put it on Cadillac and you 'll be happy again because that songs along with many other songs on that cd makes you cheer up really quickly . So I 'm telling you here and now , do n't be a wuss . Go get `` Destination Unknown '' by that greatest band alive ... MEST . You will not regret it . Trust me . I know .
 This CD is all killer , no filler . Every song rocks . The song-writing abilities of Tony Lovato and Jeremiah Rangel form a CD that can be listened to straight thru without skipping any of the songs . While most songs are very upbeat , a few songs are a little slower and pretty melancholy . If you like bands like Sugarcult , Good Charlotte , New Found Glory , and Blink-182 , I advise you to check out this band .
